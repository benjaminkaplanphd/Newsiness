S"Residents were allowed to return Tuesday to some islands in the hurricane-slammed Florida Keys as officials tried to piece together the scope of Irma's destruction and rushed aid into the drenched and debris-strewn state."
p1
aS'Two days after the storm roared into the Keys with 130 mph winds, the full extent of the destruction there was still a question mark because communications and access were cut off in many cases.'
p2

p3
aS"The Lower Keys \xe2\x80\x94 including the chain's most distant and most populous island, Key West, with 27,000 people \xe2\x80\x94 were still off-limits, with a roadblock in place where the single highway to the farther islands was washed out."

p62
aS'Guys are throwing harder.'
p63
aS'At the plate sometimes you have no choice.'

p69
aS"That's Judge."

aS"The U.S. government received reports of three spills at one of Houston's dirtiest Superfund toxic waste sites in the days after the drenching rains from Hurricane Harvey finally stopped."
p79
aS"Aerial photos reviewed by The Associated Press show dark-colored water surrounding the site as the floods receded, flowing through Vince Bayou and into the city's ship channel."
p80
aS'The reported spills, which have been not publicly detailed, occurred at U.S. Oil Recovery, a former petroleum industry waste processing plant contaminated with a dangerous brew of cancer-causing chemicals.'
p81
aS"On Aug. 29, the day Harvey's remnants cleared out, a county pollution control team sent photos to the Environmental Protection Agency of three large concrete tanks flooded with water."
p82
aS'That led PRP Group, the company overseeing the ongoing cleanup, to call a federal emergency hotline to report a spill affecting nearby Vince Bayou.'
p83
aS'Over the next several days, the company reported two more spills of potentially contaminated storm water from U.S. Oil Recovery, according to reports and call logs obtained by the AP from the U.S. Coast Guard, which operates the National Response Center hotline.'
p84
aS'The EPA requires that spills of oil or hazardous substances in quantities that may be harmful to public health or the environment be immediately reported to the 24-hour hotline when public waterways are threatened.'
p85
aS'The EPA has not publicly acknowledged the three spills that PRP Group reported to the Coast Guard.'
p86
aS'The agency said an on-scene coordinator was at the site last Wednesday and found no evidence that material had washed off the site.'
p87
aS'The EPA says it is still assessing the scene.'
p88
aS'The AP reported in the days after Harvey that at least seven Superfund sites in and around Houston were underwater during the record-shattering storm.'
p89
aS'Journalists surveyed the sites by boat, vehicle and on foot.'
p90
aS'U.S. Oil Recovery was not one of the sites visited by AP.'
p91
aS'EPA said at the time that its personnel had been unable to reach the sites, though they surveyed the locations using aerial photos.'
p92
aS"Following AP's report, EPA has been highlighting the federal agency's response to the flooding at Superfund sites."
p93
aS'EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt reiterated that safeguarding the intensely-polluted sites is among his top priorities during a visit Friday to the San Jacinto River Waste Pits, one of the sites AP reported about two weeks ago.'
p94
aS'Pruitt then boarded a Coast Guard aircraft for an aerial tour of other nearby Superfund sites flooded by Harvey, including U.S. Oil Recovery.'
p95
aS'Photos taken Aug. 31 by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration shows dark-colored water surrounding the site two days after the first spill was reported to the government hotline.'
p96
aS'While the photos do not prove contaminated materials leaked from U.S. Oil Recovery, they do show that as the murky floodwaters receded, they flowed through Vince Bayou and emptied into the ship channel leading to the San Jacinto River.'
p97
aS'The hotline caller identified Vince Bayou as the waterway affected by a spill of unknown material in unknown amounts.'
p98
aS'Thomas Voltaggio, a retired EPA official who oversaw Superfund cleanups and emergency responses for more than two decades, reviewed the aerial photos, hotline reports and other documents obtained by AP.'
p99
aS'"It is intuitively obvious that the rains and floods of the magnitude that occurred during Hurricane Harvey would have resulted in some level of contamination having been released to the environment," said Voltaggio, who is now a private consultant.'
p100
aS'"Any contamination in those tanks would likely have entered Vince Bayou and potentially the Houston Ship Channel".'
p101
aS'He said the amount of contaminants spread from the site during the storm will likely never be known, making the environmental impact difficult to measure.'
p102
aS'The Houston Ship Channel was already a polluted waterway, with Texas state health officials warning that women of childbearing age and children should not eat fish or crabs caught there because of contamination from dioxins and PCBs.'
p103
aS'PRP Group, the corporation formed to oversee the cleanup at U.S. Oil Recovery, said it reported the spills as legally required but said subsequent testing of storm water remaining in the affected tanks showed it met federal drinking water standards.'
p104
aS'The company declined to provide AP copies of those lab reports or a list of specific chemicals for which it tested, saying the EPA was expected to release that information soon.'
p105
aS'U.S. Oil Recovery was shut down in 2010 after regulators determined operations there posed an environmental threat to Vince Bayou, which flows through the property in Pasadena.'
p106

aS'More than 100 companies that sent hazardous materials and oily waste to U.S. Oil Recovery for processing are now paying for the multimillion-dollar cleanup there through a court-monitored settlement, including Baker Hughes Oilfield Operations Inc., U.S. Steel Corp.'
p110
aS'and Dow Chemical Co. Past sampling of materials at the site revealed high concentrations of hazardous chemicals linked to cancer, such as benzene, ethylbenzene and trichloroethylene.'
p111
aS'The site also potentially contains toxic heavy metals, including mercury and arsenic.'
p112
aS'A 2012 EPA study of the more than 500 Superfund sites across the United States located in flood zones specifically noted the risk that floodwaters might carry away and spread toxic materials over a wider area.'
p113
aS'Over the past six years, remediation efforts at U.S. Oil Recovery have focused on the northern half of the site, including demolishing contaminated structures, removing an estimated 500 tons of sludge and hauling away more than 1,000 abandoned containers of waste.'
p114
aS'PRP Group said the southern portion of the site, including the three waste tanks that flooded during Harvey, has not yet been fully cleaned.'
p115
aS'Over the years workers have removed more than 1.5 million gallons of liquid waste \xe2\x80\x94 enough to fill nearly three Olympic-sized swimming pools.'
p116
aS'AP began asking the EPA whether contaminated material might have again leaked from U.S. Oil Recovery last week, after reviewing the aerial photos taken Aug. 31.'
p117
aS'The EPA said it visited the site on Sept. 4, nearly a week after site operators reported an initial spill, and again the following week.'
p118
aS'The EPA said that its staff saw no evidence that toxins had washed away from the scene during either visit.'
p119
aS'"Yesterday, an EPA On-scene coordinator conducted an inspection of Vince Bayou to follow up on a rumor that material was offsite and did not find any evidence of a black oily discharge or material from the U.S. Oil Recovery site," an EPA media release said on Thursday.'
p120
aS'PRP Group said the spills occurred at the toxic waste site on Aug. 29, Sept. 6 and Sept. 7.'
p121
aS"One of the EPA's media releases on Sept. 9, more than 11 days after the first call was made to the hotline, made reference to overflowing water at the scene, but did not describe it as a spill."
p122
aS"The company said it reported the first spill after Harvey's floodwaters swamped the three tanks, filling them."
p123
aS'The resulting pressure that built up in the tanks dislodged plugs blocking a series of interconnecting pipes, causing the second and third spills reported to the hotline the following week.'
p124
aS'The company does not know how much material leaked from the tanks, soaking into the soil or flowing into nearby Vince Bayou.'
p125
aS'As part of its post-storm cleanup workers have vacuumed 63 truckloads holding about 315,000 gallons from the tanks.'
p126
aS'The Superfund site is located just a few hundred yards from the Pollution Control Services offices for Harris County, which includes Houston.'
p127
aS'Its director, Bob Allen, says his team took pictures of the flooding on Aug. 29, when the area that includes the three big tanks was still underwater.'
p128
aS'The AP requested those photos as public records, but they have not yet been released.'
p129
aS'Allen said his staff did not note any black water or oily sheen on the surface at the time, and did not collect water samples for testing.'
p130
aS'He said the EPA later sampled the area to determine whether there was contamination.'
p131
aS'"We knew that the water probably got into the plant, probably washed out some of the stuff that was in the clarifier," Allen said, referring to one of the old concrete tanks once used to store toxic waste.'
p132
aS'A summer of natural catastrophes, from epic hurricanes to scorching wildfires, has exposed another peril in disaster-prone states: How to pay for the rescues, repairs and rebuilding.'
p133
aS'The combined tab from Hurricanes Harvey and Irma is expected to hit $200 billion or more.'
p134
aS'While the federal government is expected to pay most of that, the affected state and local governments have to start paying for recovery now and eventually could be on the hook for tens of millions of dollars or more.'
p135
aS'States vary on how prepared they are to weather such costs.'
p136
aS'Florida and South Carolina, both hit by Hurricane Irma, are among the dozen or so states that do not have dedicated disaster funds and opt to cover the expenses after the fact, potentially by dipping into reserves or shifting money from other state agencies.'
p137
aS'Experts say such pay-as-you-go disaster funding can be risky.'
p138
aS'Add an economic downturn when reserves are low and budgets are tight, and state and local officials could easily find themselves struggling to pay for recovery and rebuilding.'
p139
aS'Even putting money into a dedicated disaster fund may not be enough.'
p140
aS'In Montana, where wildfires raged across the state this summer, threatening hundreds of homes and destroying a historic lodge in Glacier National Park, the firefighting costs so far have exceeded the amount set aside in a special disaster fund by $20 million.'
p141
aS'"It took us all by surprise," state Rep.'
p142
aS'Nancy Ballance said.'
p143
aS'All but a handful of states maintain so-called rainy day accounts, but in most cases "rainy day" is a misnomer: The money is typically used to get through economic downturns rather than responding to natural disasters.'
p144
aS'States tapped, and in many cases depleted, their rainy day funds to avoid massive cuts and maintain critical services after tax revenue plummeted during the recession.'
p145
aS"Several states have struggled to rebuild their savings since then because tax revenue hasn't rebounded enough to provide a cushion."
p146
aS'In all, 33 states reported tax revenue coming in below forecast last year.'
p147
aS"New Jersey's rainy day fund has been empty since 2009."
p148
aS"Pennsylvania's is so small it would barely fund government operations for two hours, according to a recent study by the Pew Charitable Trusts."
p149
aS'Texas, hit hard by Hurricane Harvey last month, has the largest rainy day fund of any state \xe2\x80\x94 $10 billion \xe2\x80\x94 but state officials are keeping that as a last resort.'
p150
aS'Gov. Greg Abbott has said he wants to consider what other funding might be available first.'
p151
aS'That could include tapping into money already allocated to state agencies.'
p152
aS'Others in Texas, including Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, have advocated for tapping into reserves now.'
p153
aS'"If this isn\'t a rainy day, I don\'t know what is," Patrick said last week.'
p154
aS'Georgia is one of the states better prepared financially to handle the unexpected costs of a disaster.'

p159
aS'In addition to budget reserves, 28 states have established special funds to help residents and businesses after a disaster.'
p160
aS'The downside: Several are not currently funded, according to the National Emergency Management Association.'
p161
aS"California is among the states with a dedicated disaster fund \xe2\x80\x94 for fighting wildfires \xe2\x80\x94 but already has burned through more than half the $427 million it set aside this year, with Southern California's fearsome Santa Ana wind season looming."

aS"Montana's wildfire season has left lawmakers there facing difficult decisions."
p165
aS'The state typically keeps between $50 million and $100 million on hand for wildfire costs.'
p166
aS'This year, after a relatively wet winter and facing an estimate of lower than expected tax revenue, lawmakers authorized the governor to use some of that money to help fill a budget gap \xe2\x80\x94 leaving about $30 million in the fund.'
p167
aS"Then disaster struck in the form of several large wildfires, which the state estimates have burned about 10 times as much land as last year's fires."
p168
aS'So far, the state has spent roughly $58 million on fire suppression since the beginning of July.'

p177
aS'It would require them to pay a predetermined amount before the federal government would provide money to repair or replace damaged infrastructure.'

aS'Mr. Wilson wonders about post-traumatic stress disorder and the ways in which it can sometimes be transferred from the person who has experienced the trauma to the next generation.'
p622
aS'"There\xe2\x80\x99s a way in which, like my father, I\xe2\x80\x99ve put an emotional wall up around myself," he said.'
p623
aS'"There is a way in which I can easily put a cocoon around my heart also and insulate myself from things that I\xe2\x80\x99ve done, things that I\xe2\x80\x99m doing, things that I\xe2\x80\x99m capable of, and not in a good way".'

aS'Was President Trump\xe2\x80\x99s bipartisan hurricane relief/debt ceiling/government funding   last week simply a "bipartisan moment," as the House speaker, Paul Ryan, put it?'
p630
aS'Probably, given this president\xe2\x80\x99s pattern of poor impulse control and of reverting to base politics.'
p631
aS'But it\xe2\x80\x99s tempting nevertheless to imagine what Mr. Trump might achieve if he could see beyond momentary, tactical wins.'

aS'Hints of bipartisan consensus are popping up in Congress around enough significant issues to suggest that a determined, strategically minded president \xe2\x80\x94 yes, we know, but bear with us \xe2\x80\x94 could strike a number of important deals.'
p633
aS'The legislation Mr. Trump signed on Friday provides $15 billion for hurricane and flooding victims and includes measures to keep the government funded until Dec. 8, instead of Sept. 30, and to extend the nation\xe2\x80\x99s borrowing authority.'
p634
aS'The extension delays the type of Tea Party-led showdown over spending and debt that has shut down the government before, but it also forces Republicans to engage in this politically damaging fight on the eve of an election year.'
p635
aS'Mr. Trump struck this bargain under the disapproving noses of his party\xe2\x80\x99s own leaders, Mr. Ryan and the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, in an Oval Office meeting with his new pals "Chuck and Nancy": the Senate minority leader, Chuck Schumer, and the House minority leader, Nancy Pelosi.'

p639
aS'Last week\xe2\x80\x99s deal granted an extension until December of this inefficient, heavily indebted program, which was set to lapse on Sept. 30.'
p640
aS'Given that Florida and Texas will require billions in payouts, this is a ripe moment for Congress and Mr. Trump to get behind an   of an outmoded program that does nothing to discourage people from building, and rebuilding, in areas prone to catastrophic flooding.'
p641
aS'They could take steps to put the program on firmer financial footing by better tying premiums to risk, buying out homes susceptible to repeated catastrophic flooding, updating mapping to reflect current climate and flooding patterns, and helping policyholders finance improvements, like raising their homes, that would reduce payouts later.'
p642
aS'Congress must vote by Sept. 30 to extend the Children\xe2\x80\x99s Health Insurance Program, which provides coverage for nine million low-income children.'

aS'Democrats see the legislation as a vehicle for an amendment to extend for a year Affordable Care Act subsidies that reduce deductibles and co-pays for lower-income enrollees.'

aS'Conservatives would normally have little interest in this, but state governors of both parties are demanding that Congress extend the A.C.A. subsidies now.'

p649
aS'The DACA program will now expire in six months, plunging these immigrants into limbo, and so far, Congress has done nothing but talk about helping them.'
p650
aS'Democrats see some hope in Mr. Trump\xe2\x80\x99s seeming lack of commitment to his own draconian edict \xe2\x80\x94 last week, "Nancy" persuaded him to tweet reassurance to those affected.'
p651
aS'It\xe2\x80\x99s a slim reed, but they hope he will pressure Republicans to act on the Dream Act, a 16-year-old proposal to resolve these immigrants\xe2\x80\x99 legal status permanently.'
p652
aS'Republicans, no doubt aware how it would look to subject 800,000 young people to deportation in a congressional election year, say they\xe2\x80\x99re working on it, but on Monday the Senate Judiciary Committee postponed a hearing on the issue.'

aS'As difficult as those items might be, there are other, tougher possibilities.'
p655
aS'In February, Democrats called Mr. Trump\xe2\x80\x99s bluff on his promise for a $1 trillion infrastructure spending program by sending him an outline proposal.'
p656
aS'The response?'
p657
aS'Radio silence.'
p658
aS'Mr. Trump has no plan, only vague suggestions of spurring investment through tax incentives.'
p659
aS'Democrats want direct spending.'
p660
aS'For that to happen, Mr. Trump would have to roll even more Republicans than he did on Friday.'
p661
aS'Given his lack of preparation, it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t look likely, but this is one job-creating promise his voters should expect him to keep.'
p662
aS'Mr. Trump has said he will cut taxes for working Americans, but so far, the White House has released only broad principles, including some, like tax cuts for the wealthy, that Democrats will not accept.'
p663
aS'House Republicans on the Ways and Means Committee were working to write a major tax-cut bill to avoid closing 2017 without a single big legislative win.'
p664
aS'That\xe2\x80\x99s looking like a pipe dream, and for Mr. Trump to move what he says is a top priority, he needs a plan that at least some Democrats can support.'
p665
aS'"Chuck and Nancy" want a plan that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t add to the deficit and that includes the promised middle-class tax cuts and a modest trim to corporate tax rates financed through closing tax law loopholes.'
p666
aS'They don\xe2\x80\x99t want tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans.'
p667
aS'A compromise will be long, if ever, in coming.'
p668
aS'Mr. Trump and his new Democratic friends could work on more.'
p669
aS'They could raise spending caps set to kick in next month by matching increases in military spending that Republicans want with increases in domestic spending that Democrats favor.'
p670
aS'They could back a proposal to automatically increase the debt ceiling, ending perennial partisan battles over what used to be a routine vote essentially recognizing the debts Congress has already incurred.'
p671
aS'They could agree that a "wall" on the Mexican border is a dumb idea and focus on fixing the broken immigration system (that\xe2\x80\x99s a   dream \xe2\x80\x94 Mr. Trump has threatened to shut down the government over spending on the wall).'
p672
aS'Given the continuing Russia investigations, bipartisan bitterness, the limitations of the legislative calendar and Mr. Trump himself, we have no real reason to expect his bipartisan impulse to harden into practice.'
p673
aS'But we still hope that the president who has said making deals is how "I get my kicks" might want to turn last week\xe2\x80\x99s one-off into a streak.'

aS'Umar ibn al-Khattab, a chief adviser and successor to the Prophet Muhammad, was the last truly just ruler in the Arab world, and he died 1,400 years ago.'

p688
aS'Tell me: What is freedom?'
p689
aS'That was the question.'
p690
aS'And the Assad regime responded decisively.'
p691
aS'Meanwhile, in an area of Syria seized by Al Qaeda, a video camera documented how foreign fighters from Chechnya, France, Saudi Arabia and Tunisia were terrorizing the young people of the Syrian revolution, tearing down their flag.'

aS'Then Al Qaeda posted signs on the roads under its control: "Democracy Is Blasphemy".'
p693
aS'The Syrian tragedy came to dominate screens worldwide.'
p694
aS'And the question for Arab nations was clear: Do you understand the fate of those who demand freedom and democracy?'
p695
aS'This question, which was answered with Syrian blood, confirmed that this dreadful Arab Spring must end in Damascus.'
p696
aS'America and the West confined their intervention mainly to words, as if statements alone would counter the Assad regime\xe2\x80\x99s brutality and the hatefulness of the imported terrorists.'

aS'In our time, terrorism has emerged as an effective prescription for treating all diseases \xe2\x80\x94 a postmodern sorcery that has opened Syria\xe2\x80\x99s doors to thousands of jihadis from around the world.'

p849
aS'This was   to anyone who had been paying attention.'
p850
aS'From Day 1, the White House and its lackeys in certain federal agencies have been waging what amounts to a war on science, appointing people with few scientific credentials to key positions, defunding programs that could lead to a cleaner and safer environment and a healthier population, and, most ominously, censoring scientific inquiry that could inform the public and government policy.'
p851
aS'Even allowing for justifiable budgetary reasons, in nearly every case the principal motive seemed the same: to serve commercial interests whose profitability could be affected by health and safety rules.'
p852
aS'The coal mining industry is a conspicuous example.'
p853
aS'The practice of blowing the tops off mountains to get at underlying coal seams has been attacked for years by public health and environmental interests and by many of the families whose livelihoods depend on coal.'

aS'This is a president who has never shown much fidelity to facts, unless they are his own alternative ones.'
p857
aS'Yet if there is any unifying theme beyond that to the administration\xe2\x80\x99s war on science, apart from its devotion to big industry and its reflexively antiregulatory mind-set, it is horror of the words "climate change".'
p858
aS'This starts with Mr. Trump, who has called global warming a hoax and pulled the United States from the Paris agreement on climate change.'
p859
aS'Among his first presidential acts, he instructed Scott Pruitt, the Environmental Protection Agency administrator, to deep-six President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s Clean Power Plan, aimed at reducing carbon dioxide emissions from coal-fired power plants, and ordered Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke to roll back Obama-era rules reducing the venting from natural gas wells of methane, another powerful greenhouse gas.'
p860
aS'Mr. Trump has been properly sympathetic to the victims of hurricanes Harvey and Irma, but the fact that there is almost certainly a connection between a warming earth and increasingly destructive natural events seems not to have occurred to him or his fellow deniers.'
p861
aS'Mr. Pruitt and his colleagues have enthusiastically jumped to the task of rescinding regulations that might address the problem, meanwhile presiding over a no less ominous development: a governmentwide purge of people, particularly scientists, whose research and conclusions about the human contribution to climate change do not support the administration\xe2\x80\x99s agenda.'
p862
aS'Mr. Pruitt, for instance, is replacing dozens of members on the E.P.A.\xe2\x80\x99s scientific advisory boards; in March, he   at least five scientists from the agency\xe2\x80\x99s 18-member Board of Scientific Counselors, to be replaced, according to a spokesman, with advisers "who understand the impact of regulations on the regulated community".'

p868
aS'Even the official vocabulary of global warming has changed, as if the problem can be made to evaporate by describing it in more benign terms.'

aS'The number of arrivals in Greece has steadily declined since 2015, after measures that all but closed the route from Turkey.'

aS'On Wednesday, the court threw out their case, which seemed only to stiffen Hungary\xe2\x80\x99s opposition.'
p899
aS'With unconscious incongruity, the country\xe2\x80\x99s foreign minister, Peter Szijjarto, angrily declared that "politics has raped European law and values," vowing that no one would be relocated to Hungary against its wishes.'
p900
aS'The Court of Justice decision will not greatly improve the lot of migrants, and not just because of Hungary\xe2\x80\x99s callousness.'

aS'The program for migrants from Greece and Italy has resettled barely a quarter of the people it was supposed to help, and Eastern European countries were allotted a tiny fraction to begin with.'
p902
aS'And the European Union does not have the tools to effectively punish recalcitrant nations.'
p903
aS'Still, it is incumbent on Europe to continue to look for humanitarian solutions, whether by helping to resolve the conflicts or ease the poverty that drive people to flee, or by making room for those who reach its shores.'

aS'Hungary and its neighbors are not alone in trying to keep immigrants out.'
p906
aS'President Trump has set a scandalous example by his demagogic policy on immigration, Britain\xe2\x80\x99s vote to leave the European Union was based largely on blocking immigrants, and populist and nationalist parties have exploited immigration to gain strength in many other European nations.'
p907
aS'But it is particularly sad to see countries that so poignantly celebrated the lifting of the Iron Curtain now argue, as Hungary does, that being asked to take in a small number of Muslim immigrants is somehow a violation of European laws and values.'

aS'It is commonly believed that Russia\xe2\x80\x99s interference in the 2016 presidential campaign consisted mainly of the hacking and leaking of Democratic emails and unfavorable stories circulated abroad about Hillary Clinton.'
p911
aS'But as a startling   of The New York Times, and new research by the cybersecurity firm FireEye, now reveal, the Kremlin\xe2\x80\x99s stealth intrusion into the election was far broader and more complex, involving a cyberarmy of bloggers posing as Americans and spreading propaganda and disinformation to an American electorate on Facebook, Twitter and other platforms.'

p914
aS'But Russia\xe2\x80\x99s guile in using hackers and counterfeit Facebook and Twitter accounts to undermine her campaign represents a new dimension in disinformation that must not go unchallenged by Mr. Trump, however much he may have benefited from it and however close his relationship to Russian President Vladimir Putin.'
p915
aS'The attack, according to the Times report, involved hundreds or even thousands of fake accounts on Facebook and Twitter that regularly posted anti-Clinton messages.'
p916
aS'To viewers, the messages resembled the normal partisan give-and-take one expects in a political campaign; in fact they came from foreign sources.'
p917

p1496
aS'Proposed tax breaks for working people, in contrast, include relatively modest reductions in tax rates, a more generous standard deduction and tax relief for child care expenses.'
p1497
aS'A   of Mr. Trump\xe2\x80\x99s proposals by the nonpartisan Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center generously assumed that policy makers would end popular write-offs, including the deduction for state taxes, to offset the cost of the cuts.'
p1498
aS'Even then, the analysis showed that the proposed Trump tax cuts would lift after-tax income for the top 1 percent of taxpayers by at least 11.5 percent (or an average annual tax cut of $175,000), compared with a barely perceptible 1.3 percent for taxpayers in the middle (or $760 in average tax savings).'

p1504
aS'Borrowing to cut taxes \xe2\x80\x94 akin to taking cash advances on a credit card \xe2\x80\x94 is not responsible, in good times or bad.'
p1505
aS'The fixation on tax cuts is regrettable, because corporate tax reform is a worthy goal.'
p1506
aS'Done right, it would lower the top corporate tax rate to 25 percent or so, bringing it more in line with the rates of other developed nations.'

p1520
aS'To the code\xe2\x80\x99s critics, its elaborate protections of workers\xe2\x80\x99 rights, including the high cost of hiring and the even higher cost of firing, have been major obstacles to growth and foreign investment, and a primary reason for an unemployment rate that hovers stubbornly around 10 percent.'

p2258

p2263
aS'When Officer Jonathan Aledda arrived, he had no idea that Mr. Rios had autism; no idea that the black man trying to calm him down, Charles Kinsey, was his behavioral therapist; and no idea that the flashing silver object in Mr. Rios\xe2\x80\x99s hands was a toy, not a weapon.'

p2273
aS'That\xe2\x80\x99s certainly true: Another way to frame the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\xe2\x80\x99s estimate that   American schoolchildren is on the spectrum is that autistic people make up a large and extremely diverse minority population.'

aS'Officer Zink pointed out that sirens and flashing lights alone can be catastrophic sensory overload for people with autism, while a calm voice and a reassuring demeanor can go a long way toward de-escalating a tense confrontation.'
p2277
aS'He also stressed that law enforcement personnel should not expect autistic people to behave in the ways that non-autistic people do.'
p2278
aS'For example, officers should not regard a refusal to look them in the eyes as a sign of guilt, as Officer Grossman did with Connor Leibel.'
p2279
aS'In fact, many autistic people find it easier to interpret spoken instructions if they\xe2\x80\x99re   compelled to simultaneously look the speaker in the eyes.'

aS'Similar programs are underway in several police departments across the country and around the world, but they are still too few and far between.'

aS'Asked by Reuters whether there was a smoking gun showing Kaspersky Lab had provided intelligence to the Russian government, Joyce replied: "As we evaluated the technology, we decided it was a risk we couldn\xe2\x80\x99t accept".'

p3298
aS'As a result of the growing influence of the far-right social-media ecosystem, once-moribund hate groups in both the United States and Europe \xe2\x80\x94 groups that mostly existed long before "alt-right" entered the vernacular \xe2\x80\x94 are enjoying a striking uptick in recruitment.'
p3299
aS'This latest wave of potential members is young \xe2\x80\x94 teenage and 20-something men (they\xe2\x80\x99re mostly men) appear to be exhibiting interest in far-right ideas in numbers that would have been unthinkable just a few years ago.'
p3300
aS'These young men are being radicalized largely through the work of a popular group of new far-right internet personalities whose videos, blog posts and tweets have been consistently nudging the boundaries of acceptable conversation to the right \xe2\x80\x94 one of the explicit goals of racist extremists everywhere.'
p3301
aS'And while "globalist" may be one of the alt-right\xe2\x80\x99s favorite slurs, Hope Not Hate conclusively shows that the alt-right is itself now a global movement with regular interaction among far-right figures from Scotland to Sweden to Seattle.'
p3302
aS'Mr. Hermansson\xe2\x80\x99s story offers vital insights into these groups\xe2\x80\x99 tactics and their sometimes bizarre practices.'
p3303
aS'During his time undercover, he hung out with heavily armed Holocaust deniers and attended gatherings where extremists drank mead from a traditional Viking horn and prayed to the Norse god Odin.'

aS'In Charlottesville, he marched alongside hundreds of young neo-Nazis and white supremacists before he was sprayed with Mace by a counterprotester and witnessed  .'
p3305
aS'In Britain, Mr. Hermansson attended a private dinner of extremists where Greg Johnson, a reclusive leading American far-right figure who is editor in chief of Counter-Currents Publishing, explained the need to "mainstream this stuff \xe2\x80\x94 or, more precisely, we need to bring the mainstream towards us".'
p3306
aS'Mr. Johnson later expressed confidence that this process is working.'
p3307

p3308
aS'(During that same chat, he said he believed in ethnic homelands and favored telling Jews, "You need to go to Israel or we\xe2\x80\x99re going to freeze you out of our society".'
p3309
aS') This goal of mainstreaming is an abiding fixation of the far right, whose members are well aware of the problems their movement has had with attracting young people in recent decades.'
p3310
aS'At one point in Mr. Hermansson\xe2\x80\x99s footage, Colin Robertson, a far-right YouTube personality who goes by the name Millennial Woes, explained to an older extremist the importance of putting forward a friendly, accessible face: "If we don\xe2\x80\x99t appear like angry misfits, then we will end up making friendships with people who don\xe2\x80\x99t agree with us," he said.'
p3311
aS'Some of Mr. Hermansson\xe2\x80\x99s most arresting footage comes from a June meeting with Jason Reza Jorjani, a founder, along with the American white nationalist Richard Spencer and others, of the AltRight Corporation, an organization established to foster cooperation and coordination among alt-right groups in Europe and North America.'
p3312
aS'Mr. Hermansson and Mr. Jorjani met at an Irish pub near the Empire State Building, where the baby-faced Mr. Jorjani imagined a near future in which, thanks to liberal complacency over the migration crisis, Europe re-embraces fascism: "We will have a Europe, in 2050, where the bank notes have Adolf Hitler, Napoleon Bonaparte, Alexander the Great. And Hitler will be seen like that: like Napoleon, like Alexander, not like some weird monster who is unique in his own category \xe2\x80\x94 no, he is just going to be seen as a great European leader".'
p3313
aS'More shockingly, Mr. Jorjani bragged about his contacts in the American government.'
p3314
aS'"We had connections in the Trump administration \xe2\x80\x94 we were going to do things"!'
p3315
aS'he said at one point.'
p3316
aS'"I had contacts with the Trump administration," he said at another.'
p3317
aS'"Our original vision was the alt-right would become like a policy group for the Trump administration," he explained, and the administration figure "who was the interface was Steve Bannon".'
p3318
aS'Unfortunately, he told Mr. Hermansson, the political establishment was "disconnecting us from the Trump administration, almost completely".'
p3319
aS'(In June, Mr. Bannon hadn\xe2\x80\x99t yet left the White House and returned to Breitbart, the popular and ardently pro-Trump far-right outlet he had led before his time working for Mr. Trump.'
p3320
aS') When I called Mr. Jorjani, he was cagier about his "connections" and "contacts" in the White House.'
p3321
aS'All he meant, he said, was that he had been in touch with people who had a direct line to President Trump, though he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t say who.'
p3322
aS'Asked to comment, a White House spokeswoman said, "We have no knowledge of any conversations or contact with this person".'
p3323
aS'Either way, Mr. Jorjani said, with the ousters of Michael Flynn in February and then Mr. Bannon in August, he now views the alt-right\xe2\x80\x99s efforts to carve out a place in the White House as having failed.'
p3324
aS'(Mr. Jorjani resigned from the AltRight Corporation in August.'
p3325
aS') If Mr. Jorjani wasn\xe2\x80\x99t exaggerating to Mr. Hermansson, and he did have a relationship with White House officials, that would certainly be alarming.'
p3326
aS'But even if he was exaggerating, it\xe2\x80\x99s still important to understand how messages like his could travel from the far reaches of the right-wing internet and all the way into \xe2\x80\x94 or close to, at least \xe2\x80\x94 the White House.'
p3327
aS'The extreme alt-right are benefiting immensely from the energy being produced by a more moderate \xe2\x80\x94 but still far-right \xe2\x80\x94 faction known as the "alt-light".'
p3328
aS'The alt-light promotes a slightly softer set of messages.'
p3329
aS'Its figures \xe2\x80\x94 such as Milo Yiannopoulos, Paul Joseph Watson and Mike Cernovich \xe2\x80\x94 generally frame their work as part of an effort to defend "the West" or "Western culture" against supposed left-liberal dominance, rather than making explicitly racist appeals.'
p3330
aS'Many of them, in fact, have renounced explicit racism and anti-Semitism, though they will creep up to the line of explicitly racist speech, especially when Islam and immigration are concerned.'
p3331
aS'This apparent moderation partly explains why they tend to have much bigger online audiences than even the most important alt-right figures \xe2\x80\x94 and why Hope Not Hate describes them as "less extreme, more dangerous".'
p3332
aS'Alt-light sites like Breitbart, formerly home to Mr. Yiannopoulos, as well as Prison Planet, where Mr. Watson is editor at large, draw millions of readers and are key nodes in a hyperkinetic network that is endlessly broadcasting viral-friendly far-right news, rumors and incitement.'
p3333
aS'Fluent in the language of online irony and absurdism, and adept at producing successful memes, alt-lighters have pulled off something remarkable: They\xe2\x80\x99ve made far-right ideas hip to a subset of young people, and framed themselves as society\xe2\x80\x99s forgotten underdogs.'
p3334
aS'The alt-light provides its audience easy scapegoats for their social, economic and sexual frustrations: liberals and feminists and migrants and, of course, globalists.'

aS'Mr. Watson has  , for example, while Mr. Yiannopoulos has more than  .'

p3338
aS'According to researchers, the key to hooking new recruits into any movement, and to getting them increasingly involved over time, is to simply give them activities to participate in.'
p3339
aS'This often precedes any deep ideological commitment on the recruits\xe2\x80\x99 part and, especially early on, is more about offering them a sense of meaning and community than anything else.'
p3340
aS'Intentionally or not, the far right has deftly applied these insights to the online world.'
p3341
aS'Viewed through the filters of alt-light outlets like Breitbart and Prison Planet, or through Twitter feeds like Mr. Watson\xe2\x80\x99s, the world is a horror show of crimes by migrants, leftist censorship and attacks on common sense.'

p3346
aS'These efforts \xe2\x80\x94 a click, a retweet, a YouTube comment \xe2\x80\x94 come to feel like important parts of an epochal struggle.'
p3347
aS'The far right, once hemmed in by its own parochialism, has manufactured a worldwide online battlefield anyone with internet access can step into.'
p3348
aS'And if you\xe2\x80\x99re one of those newcomers happily playing the part of infantryman in the "meme wars" that rage daily, maybe, along the way, one of your new online Twitter buddies will say to you, "Milo\xe2\x80\x99s O.K., but have you checked out this guy Greg Johnson"?'
p3349
aS'Or maybe they\xe2\x80\x99ll invite you to a closed online forum where ideas about how to protect Europe from Muslim migrants are discussed a bit more, well, frankly.'
p3350
aS'Maybe, if you\xe2\x80\x99re really lucky, you\xe2\x80\x99ll eventually discover a whole new political movement to join.'

p3352
aS'"I\xe2\x80\x99m just fighting less and less opposition to our sorts of ideas when they\xe2\x80\x99re spoken," Mr. Johnson, the Counter-Currents editor, told Mr. Hermansson.'

p3378
aS'Imagine if the city did the same at the branch in Corona, Queens, where cramped quarters force study groups to huddle on the floor; or Red Hook, Brooklyn, where families from the nearby housing projects are eager for more job training; or Brighton Beach, Brooklyn, where rising sea levels and storms like Sandy threaten its very operations.'
p3379
aS'Some might complain that such public-private partnerships do not earn the libraries enough space or money, or that the resulting buildings are too big.'

aS'Factoring in some smart rezonings, dozens more libraries could be upgraded in this fashion.'
p3398
aS'The Robin Hood Foundation is seeking to nurture this model.'
p3399
aS'In 2015, the foundation offered the de Blasio administration a challenge grant of $25 million, to be divided among five libraries, one in each borough.'
p3400
aS'A $5 million match from the city effectively covers the cost of building out a library, which would be in a new affordable housing complex.'
p3401
aS'It is akin to the venture in Sunset Park.'
p3402
aS'"The city has used up most of its vacant land, so we really have to get creative about our existing resources," said Beatriz De La Torre, Robin Hood\xe2\x80\x99s managing director of housing.'
p3403
aS'So far, the administration is piloting this effort in only one location,   on the upper reaches of Broadway.'
p3404
aS'But many neighborhoods are clamoring for both affordable housing and expanded library services.'
p3405
aS'Libraries have become 21st-century settlement houses, providing a world of resources under one roof.'
p3406
aS'They help bridge the digital divide, invest in early literacy and lifelong learning, increase language skills and serve as civic hubs.'
p3407
aS'Let\xe2\x80\x99s add affordable housing to the list.'

aS'ZAGREB, Croatia \xe2\x80\x94 In Sarajevo, Yugoslavia, during the 1984 Winter Olympics, Elvis J. Kurtovic and his Meteors were performing   in a stifling little basement hall before 300 wild punk rock fans.'
p3409
aS'But it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t Dylan\xe2\x80\x99s rendition they were playing, it was their own, a deliberate extension that ostensibly was about the Margaret Thatcher, the prime minister of Britain.'
p3410
aS'But  Elvis J. Kurtovic and his Meteors were singing about \xe2\x80\x94 in an extremely brutal way that should have been unacceptable to the Communist authorities \xe2\x80\x94 Yugoslavia\xe2\x80\x99s own prime minister,  .'
p3411
aS'It was a brilliant trading of identities that mocked the Yugoslav regime and its ideology while playing with the form and content of a three-minute punk song.'
p3412
aS'It could be included in any global anthology of protest punk, though the editors would have to have heard of this strange Sarajevo group, which was led by Mirko Srdic, a 22-year-old engineering student and one of the cleverest and most lucid authors on the Yugoslav rock scene.'
p3413
aS'In their version of the song, Elvis J. Kurtovic and his Meteors accused Planinc \xe2\x80\x94 all while calling her Margaret Thatcher \xe2\x80\x94 of ineptitude and corruption in Kosovo, then a rebellious Yugoslav province.'
p3414
aS'If a journalist had tried to publish anything of the sort, she would have ended up in prison and been banned forever from working for Yugoslav papers.'
p3415
aS'If an ordinary citizen had talked like this in a cafe or on a tram, he would at the very least have been investigated by the police for "spreading false reports and alarming the public".'
p3416
aS'But this was a song that referred to Margaret Thatcher.'
p3417
aS'The police and the Communist Party pretended that it really was about Thatcher, and nothing happened.'
p3418
aS'Punk rock appeared early in Yugoslavia.'
p3419
aS'Yugoslav punk bands already existed by 1977, the year the Clash released its first album in Britain.'
p3420
aS'The first major punk concert, at least that I remember, took place in Pula, a town on the Croatian coast, on March 22, 1978.'
p3421
aS'Soon after, the first LPs came out from bands like Pankrti, from Ljubljana, whose name in Slovene means "illegitimate" or "bastard children".'
p3422
aS'These records were released through state-run record companies, which were under a kind of informal but ever-present party censorship.'
p3423
aS'From the standpoint of the regime these groups had extremely problematic lyrics.'
p3424
aS'They attacked the police, the authorities and the tenets of Communist ideology.'
p3425
aS'But still, they were sung and published with virtually no interference.'
p3426
aS'The reason was simple: It is less dangerous for something to exist in the shop windows of record stores and on the stages of Party-sponsored "houses of culture" than for it to live underground, conspiring against the system.'
p3427
aS'Such was the strategy of the leaders at the time, a group that would be further liberalized after the death of Yugoslavia\xe2\x80\x99s lifelong president, Marshal Josip Broz Tito, in the spring of 1980.'
p3428
aS'Like its British and American counterparts, Yugoslav punk rock was steeped in social scandal and radical political engagement.'
p3429
aS'It was a time when people were able to make a good living, and young people could find regular paid work through youth services (a Party invention that allowed high school and college students to work for money in their spare time), and with their earnings they would go to the Italian border city of Trieste or to Vienna or even to London to witness the new subcultural trends and buy records.'
p3430
aS'Because of this, the music of punk classics like the Clash, the Sex Pistols, the Buzzcocks and the Damned found its way to Yugoslavia, along with that of Patti Smith, the Stooges and New York Dolls.'
p3431
aS'Not everything was the same for us in Yugoslavia as it was in New York or London, though.'
p3432
aS'Yugoslav punk was based on rebellion, with the youth escapism that characterized some parts of the punk scene in the West almost completely absent.'
p3433
aS'Punk rock in Yugoslavia emerged and developed as a way to blaspheme the government and everything \xe2\x80\x94 or almost everything \xe2\x80\x94 that our parents\xe2\x80\x99 generation believed in.'
p3434
aS'The artistry consisted in writing songs that would be more anti-establishment than any before but would not be censored.'
p3435
aS'There was just one topic that was untouchable: Tito.'
p3436
aS'Everything else was allowed.'
p3437
aS'One could sing more or less openly against everything.'
p3438
aS'Even against Communism.'
p3439
aS'Some of these songs sounded like everyday political commentary.'
p3440
aS'During the great strike in the shipyards in Gdansk, Poland, when the labor movement Solidarity, led by the electrician Lech Walesa, had just been formed and was gaining support, the band Azra, from Zagreb, performed   all around Yugoslavia.'
p3441
aS'The song described actual events, railed against the Soviet Union and even mentioned Pope John Paul II.'
p3442
aS'The Soviet Embassy in Belgrade sent an official note to object to the song, but it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t banned The recording of "Poland in My Heart" was actually issued by Jugoton, then the largest and most influential record label in the country.'
p3443
aS'The ideology of Yugoslav punk boiled down to anti-Communism, conscious or unconscious.'
p3444
aS'And here again is the intriguing paradox: Why did the Communist authorities allow an anti-Communist youth subculture to flourish?'
p3445
aS'Yes, it was a useful outlet for youth rebellion.'
p3446
aS'But the other answer to this question became clearer a decade later.'
p3447
aS'In 1990 and \xe2\x80\x9991, Yugoslavia collapsed and Communism was replaced by ethno-nationalism.'
p3448
aS'That was when the old world would destroy itself from within, and yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s Communists, the heads of secret agencies and central committees, would seize power in the Yugoslav republics with lightning speed, transforming themselves into nationalists and right-wingers.'
p3449
aS'The people who at the beginning of the \xe2\x80\x9980s were convening Party conferences to discuss anti-Communist excesses and in the 1990s would take control of the newly established countries never cared much about anti-Communism; they cared about power.'
p3450
aS'Punk and New Wave music in Yugoslavia in the early \xe2\x80\x9980s was a unique phenomenon in the Communist world.'
p3451
aS'In the other countries of Eastern Europe \xe2\x80\x94 with the partial exception of Poland \xe2\x80\x94 punk rock truly appeared only once Communism had practically ceased to be.'
p3452
aS'Russian punk rockers, notably the women from Pussy Riot, revolted against a conservative, Vladimir Putin, at a time when Communism had faded into the past.'
p3453
aS'Punk rock arrived in Russia \xe2\x80\x94 as it had somewhat earlier in Hungary, Poland and Czechoslovakia \xe2\x80\x94 as a tardy echo of something that had taken place long before in the West, and usually it was merely an imitation of American and British models.'
p3454
aS'For many years, this was how popular and youth culture developed in Yugoslavia, too.'
p3455
aS'But with the liberalization of the political regime, and with the material enrichment of society and the expansion of the middle class, things had begun to change radically by the end of the \xe2\x80\x9970s.'
p3456
aS'In 1968, just a year after it was produced in New York, the Broadway musical "Hair" was staged in Belgrade, a landmark event in Yugoslav popular culture.'
p3457
aS'From Belgrade\xe2\x80\x99s "Hair" to Yugoslav punk rock, and then until the fall of Yugoslavia, things played out largely in synchronicity with the West.'
p3458
aS'In contrast to the Soviet Union and most other Eastern European Communist Parties, whose leaders and commissars saw control of culture, particularly popular and youth culture, as a means of safeguarding their power, the Yugoslav Communists offered culture to their citizens, especially the young, as an outlet to safely relieve social trauma, one that would also present the illusion of freedom.'
p3459
aS'Simply put, in contrast to the Leonid Brezhnev of the Soviet Union, Tito did not think that young people with drums and guitars would bring down the state.'
p3460
aS'And in the end, he was right.'
p3461
aS'As deaths mount in America\xe2\x80\x99s opioid crisis, communities on the front lines face a hidden toll: the financial cost.'
p3462
aS'Ross County, a largely rural region of 77,000 people an hour south of Columbus, Ohio, is wrestling with an explosion in opioid-related deaths - 44 last year compared to 19 in 2009.'
p3463
aS'The drug addiction epidemic is shattering not just lives but also stressing the county budget.'
p3464
aS'About 75 percent of the 200 children placed into state care in the county have parents with opioid addictions, up from about 40 percent five years ago, local officials say.'
p3465
aS'Their care is more expensive because they need specialist counseling, longer stays and therapy.'
p3466
aS'That has caused a near doubling in the county\xe2\x80\x99s child services budget to almost $2.4 million from $1.3 million, said Doug Corcoran, a county commissioner.'
p3467
aS'For a county with a general fund of just $23 million, that is a big financial burden, Corcoran said.'
p3468
aS'He and his colleagues are now exploring what they might cut to pay for the growing costs of the epidemic, such as youth programs and economic development schemes.'
p3469
aS'"There\xe2\x80\x99s very little discretionary spending in our budget to cut. It\xe2\x80\x99s really tough," Corcoran said.'
p3470
aS'Cities, towns and counties across the United States are struggling to deal with the financial costs of a drug addiction epidemic that killed 33,000 people in 2015 alone, data and interviews with more than two dozen local officials and county budget professionals shows.'
p3471
aS'(For graphics on the opioid crisis click here:  )  The interviews and data provide one of the first glimpses into the financial impact on local governments but it is far from complete because there is no central database collating information from counties and states.'
p3472
aS'So, the true scale is still mostly hidden from view.'
p3473
aS'Opioids, primarily prescription painkillers, heroin and fentanyl - a drug 50 to 100 times more powerful than morphine - are fueling the drug overdoses.'
p3474
aS'President Donald Trump last month called the epidemic a "national emergency" but has not yet made an official national emergency declaration.'
p3475
aS'Such a move would give states access to federal funds to fight it.'
p3476
aS'Counties grappling with rising overdoses face higher costs in emergency call volumes, medical examiner and coroner bills, and overcrowded jails and courtrooms, said Matt Chase, executive director of the National Association of Counties, which represents 3,069 county and local governments.'

aS'At his group\xe2\x80\x99s July annual meeting, a presentation where county officials shared tips on tackling the opioid crisis, and the budget problems the crisis is triggering, played to a packed room, Chase said.'
p3478
aS'The organization is in the early stage of collecting information to build a more complete picture of the financial impact of the crisis on county budgets, Chase said.'
p3479
aS'Indiana County, Pennsylvania, a mountainous, predominantly rural region, provides a snapshot of how the crisis is stressing local services and budgets.'
p3480
aS'Its county seat, the borough of Indiana, is home to a modern college campus and a main street lined by restaurants and American flags.'
p3481
aS'Yet beneath its outward tranquility, the opioid epidemic is everywhere, said David Rostis, an undercover detective and head of the county\xe2\x80\x99s drug task force.'
p3482
aS'On a recent ride-along in Rostis\xe2\x80\x99 car, he points to a building where a doctor used to sell opioid prescriptions for sex; a large, affluent home where a teenager died of an overdose; a trail where a drug-related killing recently occurred; and the local gas station where a woman recently overdosed and died in her car while people passed by.'
p3483
aS'In 2016, the county\xe2\x80\x99s drug overdose death rate was 50.6 deaths per 100,000, compared to the state average of 36.5.'
p3484
aS'Autopsy and toxicology costs there have nearly doubled in six years, from about $89,000 in 2010 to $165,000 in 2016, county data shows.'
p3485
aS'Court costs are soaring, mainly because of the expense of prosecuting opioid-related crimes and providing accused with a public defender, local officials say.'
p3486
aS'The county is using contingency funds to pay for the added coroner costs, said Mike Baker, the county\xe2\x80\x99s top government official.'
p3487

p3492
aS'The county pays $48.50 per inmate per day to the jail, and this year the jail is on course to have over 2,000 more "inmate days" compared to 2015, according to county data.'
p3493
aS'"At least 90 percent of those extra jail costs are opioid-related," said Greg Puckett, a county commissioner who sits on a national county opioid task force.'

aS'As costs related to the opioid epidemic increase, Indiana County commissioner Baker isn\xe2\x80\x99t sure what will happen next.'
p3513
aS'Unless the state or federal government intervene, the county will have to either cut services or increase taxes, Baker said.'
p3514
aS'"This has introduced an entirely different metric, an entirely different level of unpredictability in budgeting," he said.'
p3515
aS'For all the budget problems Baker faces because of the crisis, the human toll is what distresses him most.'

p3973
aS'The women brought Noi\xe2\x80\x99s body back to Muzbat.'
p3974
aS'The men followed the tracks to the R.S.F. camp, where the base commander came out to meet them.'
p3975
aS'He refused to allow them into the camp, but told them he was holding the militia man who had confessed to killing Noi.'
p3976
aS'The R.S.F. commander sent the villagers home.'
p3977
aS'The villagers learned that the suspected killer was an R.S.F. soldier, who had an injury to his head.'
p3978
aS'He had wiped the blood from his gun and clothes but had taken Noi\xe2\x80\x99s shoes.'
p3979
aS'He had left the R.S.F. camp with his rifle.'
p3980
aS'He saw Noi and followed her for hours to an isolated place, where he attacked her.'
p3981
aS'He had tried to rape her, but Noi fought back, wounding him in the head before he shot and killed her.'
p3982
aS'Back at Muzbat, the villagers raised the alarm and sought help from surrounding villages.'
p3983
aS'The next day, hundreds of villagers from the area went to the R.S.F. base to demand justice for Noi.'
p3984
aS'With tension rising, the R.S.F. sent the suspect to El Fasher under arrest.'
p3985
aS'It is very unusual in such cases that a killer is ever found.'
p3986
aS'Even more unusual that one should be arrested.'
p3987
aS'Perhaps the R.S.F. commander thought he had to act because the evidence was undeniable and he was confronted with the angry villagers.'
p3988
aS'Yet there have been no news reports, either about the attack and killing of Noi, or concerning the arrest of her suspected killer.'
p3989
aS'In fact, two government officials later visited the village, found and deleted pictures of Noi\xe2\x80\x99s body on villagers\xe2\x80\x99 cellphones, and warned the inhabitants not to speak to the media.'
p3990
aS'We, Noi\xe2\x80\x99s family, are not surprised that the government is taking steps to hide its crimes.'
p3991
aS'We fear that the killer will not see justice.'
p3992
aS'Incredibly, the same R.S.F. that attacks villages in Darfur and is responsible for killings and rapes is being paid by the European Union to help stem the flow of refugees who might find their way to Europe.'
p3993
aS'An   earlier this year found that European Union funding for the Sudanese effort to curb migration already amounted to nearly 215 million euros.'
p3994
aS'Another   called this European support for the R.S.F. a case of "Border Control From Hell".'
p3995
aS'I can testify that this rebranded Janjaweed militia is not a source of stability, but an agent of death and destruction.'
p3996
aS'It is a scandal that the R.S.F. is, in effect, funded by the European Union.'
p3997
aS'I tell Noi\xe2\x80\x99s story in the hope that some publicity about her murder will help to ensure that her killer will not escape justice.'
p3998
aS'I hope, too, that the European Union and the United States, which is expected to decide next month on whether to lift sanctions on Sudan, will see the R.S.F. and the government in Khartoum for what they are.'
p3999
aS'I dream of the day that peace and justice come to Darfur, for Noi\xe2\x80\x99s sake and for all Darfuris.'
p4000
aS'After the white-nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Va., last month where a man drove a car into a crowd, killing a counter-demonstrator, the American neo-Nazi website The Daily Stormer published a long, hate-riddled post mocking the victim.'
p4001
aS'Outcry over the article led its domain registrar, GoDaddy,  .'
p4002
aS'The site then registered with Google, which also quickly canceled its hosting.'
p4003
aS'But it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t until Cloudflare, a website security and performance service, dropped the site as a client that The Daily Stormer truly lost its ability to stay online.'
p4004
aS'Because of the precise nature of Cloudflare\xe2\x80\x99s business, and the scarcity of competitors, its role censoring internet speech is not just new, it\xe2\x80\x99s  What makes Cloudflare an essential part of the internet is   from barraging clients\xe2\x80\x99 websites with requests that take them offline.'
p4005
aS'Cloudflare is one of the few companies in the world that provide this kind of reliable protection.'
p4006
aS'If you don\xe2\x80\x99t want your website to get taken down by extortionists, jokers, political opposition or hackers, you have to hire Cloudflare or one of its very few competitors.'
p4007
aS'Generally speaking, there are two kinds of corporate players on the internet: companies that build infrastructure through which content flows, and companies that seek to curate content and create a community.'
p4008
aS'Internet service providers like Verizon and Comcast, domain name servers, web hosts and security services providers like Cloudflare are all the former \xe2\x80\x94 or the "pipe".'
p4009
aS'They typically don\xe2\x80\x99t look at the content their clients and customers are putting up, they just give them the means to do it and let it flow.'
p4010
aS'Social media platforms like Facebook are the latter.'
p4011
aS'They encourage their users to create, share and engage with content \xe2\x80\x94 so they look at content all the time and decide whether they want to allow hateful material like that of neo-Nazis to stay up.'
p4012
aS'While there have long been worries about internet service providers favoring access to some content over others, there has been less concern about companies further along the pipeline holding an internet on/off switch.'
p4013
aS'In large part, this is because at other points in the pipeline, users have choice.'
p4014
aS'Private companies can make their own rules, and consumers can choose among them.'
p4015
aS'If GoDaddy won\xe2\x80\x99t register your domain, you can go to Bluehost or thousands of other companies.'
p4016
aS'But the fewer choices you have for the infrastructure you need to stay online, the more serious the consequences when companies refuse service.'
p4017
aS'This is why Cloudflare\xe2\x80\x99s decision to drop The Daily Stormer is so significant.'
p4018
aS'Denying security service to one Nazi website seems fine now, but what if Cloudflare started suspending service for a political candidate that its chief executive didn\xe2\x80\x99t like?'
p4019
aS'With this move, Cloudflare is wading into the business of evaluating the content of its clients \xe2\x80\x94 something sites like Facebook and Twitter have been wrestling with for years, leading them to develop complex rules and procedures that govern what users are and are not allowed to post.'
p4020
aS'Most agree that it\xe2\x80\x99s appropriate for social media companies to take down certain kinds of content \xe2\x80\x94 that\xe2\x80\x99s how they ensure our newsfeeds aren\xe2\x80\x99t full of pornography or violence.'
p4021
aS'But that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean we don\xe2\x80\x99t want that type of content to be able to exist   on the internet.'
p4022
aS'Ensuring that sites like Cloudflare remain content-neutral might be necessary to guarantee that.'
p4023
aS'One of the additional difficulties with Cloudflare is that it is not so much a piece of pipe as it is a service.'
p4024
aS'Specifically, it is a paid-for-protection service.'
p4025
aS'Having to hire Cloudflare to protect your website is like having to hire security to protect you from attackers when you speak in the public square.'
p4026
aS'If that security service is the only one in town, and you\xe2\x80\x99ll be silenced if you try to speak without it, maybe that security service shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t pick and choose whom it protects.'
p4027
aS'While regulation should not be done lightly or broadly, there\xe2\x80\x99s a case to be made that we should treat Cloudflare more like the police, who are supposed to equally protect all members of the public.'
p4028
aS'Last week, Matthew Prince, Cloudflare\xe2\x80\x99s chief executive, acknowledged how much power his company has, and what\xe2\x80\x99s at stake.'
p4029
aS'"The internet is a really important resource for everyone," he said in an interview with  , "but there\xe2\x80\x99s a very limited set of companies that control it and there\xe2\x80\x99s such little accountability to us that it really is quite a dangerous thing".'
p4030
aS'This is the most terrifying realization surrounding Cloudflare\xe2\x80\x99s removal of a site from the internet: There\xe2\x80\x99s a lack of accountability present at every part of the pipeline and on platforms.'
p4031
aS'The people who run these companies are not elected officials, yet we still expect them to safeguard our basic liberties while also meeting our cultural expectations.'
p4032
aS'For the most part they do: both because it\xe2\x80\x99s good business to meet the expectations of their users, and because most have praiseworthy goals of corporate responsibility.'
p4033
aS'Beyond these minor checks on these companies\xe2\x80\x99 power, we as users have no way to ensure they meet our needs \xe2\x80\x94 and we have no idea what site they\xe2\x80\x99ll take down next.'
p4034
aS'This is a pivotal moment in American history.'
p4035
aS'Do we, as a nation, join the rest of the industrialized world and guarantee comprehensive health care to every person as a human right?'
p4036
aS'Or do we maintain a system that is enormously expensive, wasteful and bureaucratic, and is designed to maximize profits for big insurance companies, the pharmaceutical industry, Wall Street and medical equipment suppliers?'
p4037
aS'We remain the only major country on earth that allows chief executives and stockholders in the health care industry to get incredibly rich, while tens of millions of people suffer because they can\xe2\x80\x99t get the health care they need.'
p4038
aS'This is not what the United States should be about.'
p4039
aS'All over this country, I have heard from Americans who have shared heartbreaking stories about our dysfunctional system.'
p4040
aS'Doctors have told me about patients who died because they put off their medical visits until it was too late.'
p4041
aS'These were people who had no insurance or could not afford out-of-pocket costs imposed by their insurance plans.'
p4042
aS'I have heard from older people who have been forced to split their pills in half because they couldn\xe2\x80\x99t pay the outrageously high price of prescription drugs.'
p4043
aS'Oncologists have told me about cancer patients who have been unable to acquire lifesaving treatments because they could not afford them.'
p4044
aS'This should not be happening in the world\xe2\x80\x99s wealthiest country.'
p4045
aS'Americans should not hesitate about going to the doctor because they do not have enough money.'
p4046
aS'They should not worry that a hospital stay will bankrupt them or leave them deeply in debt.'
p4047
aS'They should be able to go to the doctor they want, not just one in a particular network.'
p4048
aS'They should not have to spend huge amounts of time filling out complicated forms and arguing with insurance companies as to whether or not they have the coverage they expected.'
p4049
aS'Even though 28 million Americans remain uninsured and even more are underinsured, we spend far more per capita on health care than any other industrialized nation.'
p4050
aS'In 2015, the United States spent almost $10,000 per person for health care; the Canadians, Germans, French and British spent less than half of that, while guaranteeing health care to everyone.'
p4051
aS'Further, these countries have higher life expectancy rates and lower infant mortality rates than we do.'
p4052
aS'The reason that our health care system is so outrageously expensive is that it is not designed to provide quality care to all in a cost-effective way, but to provide huge profits to the medical-industrial complex.'
p4053
aS'Layers of bureaucracy associated with the administration of hundreds of individual and complicated insurance plans is stunningly wasteful, costing us hundreds of billions of dollars a year.'
p4054
aS'As the only major country not to negotiate drug prices with the pharmaceutical industry, we spend tens of billions more than we should.'
p4055
aS'The solution to this crisis is not hard to understand.'
p4056
aS'A half-century ago, the United States established Medicare.'
p4057
aS'Guaranteeing comprehensive health benefits to Americans over 65 has proved to be enormously successful, cost-effective and popular.'
p4058
aS'Now is the time to expand and improve Medicare to cover all Americans.'
p4059
aS'This is not a radical idea.'
p4060
aS'I live 50 miles south of the Canadian border.'
p4061
aS'For decades, every man, woman and child in Canada has been guaranteed health care through a single-payer, publicly funded health care program.'
p4062
aS'This system has not only improved the lives of the Canadian people but has also saved families and businesses an immense amount of money.'
p4063
aS'On Wednesday I will introduce the Medicare for All Act in the Senate with 15 co-sponsors and support from dozens of grass-roots organizations.'
p4064
aS'Under this legislation, every family in America would receive comprehensive coverage, and middle-class families would save thousands of dollars a year by eliminating their private insurance costs as we move to a publicly funded program.'
p4065
aS'The transition to the Medicare for All program would take place over four years.'
p4066
aS'In the first year, benefits to older people would be expanded to include dental care, vision coverage and hearing aids, and the eligibility age for Medicare would be lowered to 55.'
p4067
aS'All children under the age of 18 would also be covered.'
p4068
aS'In the second year, the eligibility age would be lowered to 45 and in the third year to 35.'
p4069
aS'By the fourth year, every man, woman and child in the country would be covered by Medicare for All.'
p4070
aS'Needless to say, there will be huge opposition to this legislation from the powerful special interests that profit from the current wasteful system.'
p4071
aS'The insurance companies, the drug companies and Wall Street will undoubtedly devote a lot of money to lobbying, campaign contributions and television ads to defeat this proposal.'
p4072
aS'But they are on the wrong side of history.'
p4073
aS'Guaranteeing health care as a right is important to the American people not just from a moral and financial perspective; it also happens to be what the majority of the American people want.'
p4074
aS'According to an   by The Economist/YouGov, 60 percent of the American people want to "expand Medicare to provide health insurance to every American," including 75 percent of Democrats, 58 percent of independents and 46 percent of Republicans.'
p4075
aS'Now is the time for Congress to stand with the American people and take on the special interests that dominate health care in the United States.'
p4076
aS'Now is the time to extend Medicare to everyone.'
p4077
aS'"Controversies over freedom of speech on college campuses have existed as long as there have been college campuses. But the specific issues vary with each generation".'
p4078
aS'That is the first line of Erwin Chemerinsky\xe2\x80\x99s new book, "Free Speech on Campus," written with Howard Gillman.'
p4079
aS'Mr. Chemerinsky is not only one of the foremost legal scholars on the First Amendment but also a firsthand witness to the free speech debates of today as the new dean of the University of California Berkeley School of Law.'
p4080
aS'Here he talks with Natalie Shutler, the editor of the   column, about hate speech, censorship and what campuses can and can\xe2\x80\x99t do.'
p4081
aS'This interview has been edited and condensed.'
p4082
aS'Hi, Professor!'
p4083
aS'I have spent the past year talking with college students about free speech and, as you know all too well, it\xe2\x80\x99s a contentious topic for them.'
p4084
aS'In this loud internet age, in which provocative opinions are hitting us constantly and from all sides, plenty of students don\xe2\x80\x99t see value in hosting more of the same on their campuses.'
p4085
aS'One thing I appreciate about your new book is that you are thoughtful about these students\xe2\x80\x99 concerns, even if you disagree with their conclusions.'
p4086
aS'I think we have to be attentive to the fact that many students want to restrict speech because of very laudable instincts.'
p4087
aS'They want to protect other students from hate speech.'
p4088
aS'They want to create an inclusive community for all.'
p4089
aS'But the response to hate speech can\xe2\x80\x99t be to prohibit and punish it.'
p4090
aS'It\xe2\x80\x99s unconstitutional.'
p4091
aS'We have to find other ways to create inclusive communities.'
p4092
aS'For many students, it\xe2\x80\x99s not just about hate speech, but the kind of speech that creates harm.'
p4093
aS'This term is agonizingly broad and open to wildly different interpretations.'
p4094
aS'But students aren\xe2\x80\x99t wrong in thinking that speech can be a weapon.'
p4095
aS'Students are quite right.'
p4096
aS'We protect speech   of its effects.'
p4097
aS'If speech had no effects, it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be a fundamental right.'
p4098
aS'Those effects can be positive but they can also be very negative.'
p4099
aS'Speech can cause enormous harm.'
p4100
aS'It can be hurtful, it can cause people to be excluded, and it can interfere with education or employment.'
p4101
aS'Especially in colleges and universities, we have to be attentive to that.'
p4102
aS'But you do take a hard line in your book that even hate speech must be protected.'
p4103
aS'The law under the First Amendment is clear: Hate speech is protected speech.'
p4104
aS'Over 300 colleges and universities adopted hate speech codes in the early 1990s.'
p4105
aS'Every one to be challenged in court was ruled unconstitutional.'
p4106
aS'And there are good reasons for that.'
p4107
aS'After some really ugly incidents at the University of Michigan in the late 1980s, the school adopted a hate speech code that was undoubtedly well intentioned.'
p4108
aS'But a federal court declared it unconstitutional, in part, because it was so vague.'
p4109
aS'It said that there could not be speech that "demeans or stigmatizes" anyone based on race or gender.'
p4110
aS'But what does that mean?'
p4111
aS'A sociobiology student who challenged the law said, "I want to study whether there are inherent differences between women and men. What if my conclusions are deemed stigmatizing on the basis of gender"?'
p4112
aS'And during the years Michigan\xe2\x80\x99s speech code was on the books, more than 20 black students were charged with racist speech by white students.'
p4113
aS'There wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a single instance of a white student being punished for racist speech, even though that was what had prompted the drafting of the Michigan speech code in the first place.'
p4114
aS'That\xe2\x80\x99s part of a much bigger historical pattern: As we saw in Michigan, when hate speech codes or laws are adopted, they are most often directed at the very groups they are meant to protect.'
p4115
aS'You make the distinction in your new book that this doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean that the First Amendment is absolute.'
p4116
aS'For example, there is no constitutional protection for a   or for harassment.'
p4117
aS'Campuses can protect students against that kind of speech.'
p4118
aS'But before you address unprotected speech, maybe we should talk a bit about the history of free speech, which you lay out in your book.'
p4119
aS'It is hard to imagine social progress anywhere that wasn\xe2\x80\x99t dependent on freedom of speech.'
p4120
aS'The civil rights protests of the 1960s \xe2\x80\x94 the lunch counter sit-ins, the marches and demonstrations \xe2\x80\x94 were essential to federal civil rights acts and the end of Jim Crow laws that segregated every aspect of the South.'
p4121
aS'The anti-Vietnam War protests were crucial for the end of that war.'
p4122
aS'This has been true throughout American history.'
p4123
aS'The 19th Amendment that gave women the right to vote was the product of demonstrations and speech.'
p4124
aS'Now, as you point out, many students associate free speech with the vitriol of the internet more than they do with the civil rights movement.'
p4125
aS'I feel for them.'
p4126
aS'The internet is terrible.'
p4127
aS'But how do you see things turning around?'
p4128
aS'How do you think students could begin to associate free speech as something for the vulnerable?'
p4129
aS'Some of this is about a lack of education about the history of freedom of speech.'
p4130
aS'I do worry that students today may equate free speech more with cruel or racist posts on Yik Yak than with the civil rights protests of the 1960s.'
p4131
aS'But even when students talk about harm and safety, they need to remember how malleable those terms are.'
p4132
aS'There is no doubt that the civil rights protests deeply offended many Southerners, however objectionable that may sound to us today.'
p4133
aS'An example like that illustrates why offensiveness to an audience can\xe2\x80\x99t justify stopping speech.'
p4134
aS'Identity is important to nearly every college student I talk to, regardless of their background or political persuasion.'
p4135
aS'You make the case that free speech is the basis for asserting identities and, in particular, was necessary for the expansion in public of countercultural identities \xe2\x80\x94 including, and I\xe2\x80\x99m reading straight from the book here, "forms of expression that challenge traditional religion, prevailing social mores, familiar lifestyle choices, inherited views about sexuality, or historic gender roles".'
p4136
aS'But of course, some identities are much more vulnerable to intimidation than others.'
p4137
aS'You argue that college administrations need not ignore that.'
p4138
aS'An administration can\xe2\x80\x99t bar a campus speaker, but it can engage in its own speech by reaffirming the social standards of the community and reaching out to students who might be offended or hurt.'
p4139
aS'Campuses don\xe2\x80\x99t need to stand behind offensive speakers; they just need to allow them the opportunity to speak.'
p4140
aS'I think it\xe2\x80\x99s so important for campus officials to respond to and condemn hate speech.'
p4141
aS'Just because the First Amendment protects a right to say something, that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean it   be said.'
p4142
aS'Campus officials can describe the type of community they want to create and denounce hate speech as inconsistent with it.'
p4143
aS'Many years ago, when I was teaching at the University of Southern California Law School, someone wrote a very offensive homophobic slur on a chalkboard.'
p4144
aS'The dean did not try to find out who did it or threaten punishment.'
p4145
aS'Instead, he wrote a very powerful statement about why what happened was inconsistent with the community we aspired to be.'
p4146
aS'His message had an enormously positive effect.'
p4147
aS'Also, it is very important that the students themselves respond to offensive speech.'
p4148
aS'They can hold counter-demonstrations, teach-ins and protests.'
p4149
aS'All of that is protected speech.'
p4150
aS'They just can\xe2\x80\x99t protest in a way that interferes with the ability of others to speak.'
p4151
aS'The law is clear that even in places that are open to speech, there can be time, place and manner restrictions, so long as there are adequate places for free speech.'
p4152
aS'There is a right to speak on the campus, but there is no right to come into my classroom and shout me down.'
p4153
aS'There is a right to use public streets and sidewalks, but a city can prevent trucks with sound amplification equipment from playing music in the middle of the night.'
p4154
aS'Dormitories are also a very special place of repose for students.'
p4155
aS'It\xe2\x80\x99s their home, and the Supreme Court has recognized the protection of privacy of people in their homes.'
p4156
aS'So there can be much greater restrictions in dormitories \xe2\x80\x94 but it always has to be content neutral.'
p4157
aS'It can\xe2\x80\x99t be based on content or message.'
p4158
aS'Right, so you could say that no one is allowed to hang flags from their window, but not that no one is allowed to hang Confederate flags from their window.'
p4159
aS'Exactly.'
p4160
aS'Obviously violence \xe2\x80\x94 like what we saw in Charlottesville and could presumably expect near other college towns in the coming year \xe2\x80\x94 is not protected by the Constitution.'
p4161
aS'But I have heard from many students that they are frustrated with the idea that people of color and other vulnerable demographic groups are responsible for staying nonviolent and peaceful when aggressive demonstrators march on their colleges.'
p4162
aS'It\xe2\x80\x99s not that they want violence, but that they feel that they are being told to respond to aggression with passivity.'
p4163
aS'Could you comment on that?'
p4164
aS'I certainly understand where they are coming from.'
p4165
aS'There is no right to engage in violence.'
p4166
aS'Campuses can take steps to prevent violence \xe2\x80\x94 such as preventing weapons at demonstrations, having speakers be in areas where safety can best be assured, and moving counter-demonstrations to another area.'
p4167
aS'Also, if speech is a true threat \xe2\x80\x94 causing a person to reasonably fear imminent physical harm \xe2\x80\x94 it is not protected by the First Amendment.'
p4168
aS'What about the argument that some inflammatory speakers come to campus with the express aim of creating a hostile environment?'
p4169
aS'It is important to recognize that a public university has no choice but to allow speakers on campus even if their message is regarded as hateful or racist.'
p4170
aS'If the campus tried to exclude such a speaker, it would get sued and the speaker would win and likely would be made a martyr for the First Amendment in the process.'
p4171
aS'Nothing can be gained by exclusion.'
p4172
aS'But the campus must ensure safety for its students, staff and faculty.'
p4173
aS'This might include regulating where the controversial speaker is allowed to be present and, likely, it will include more of a police presence.'
p4174
aS'I am sympathetic to the concerns of students who are wary about more police coming to campus, but not having law enforcement present in the face of a danger to public safety risks even greater harms.'
p4175
aS'The central principle of the First Amendment \xe2\x80\x94 and of academic freedom \xe2\x80\x94 is that all ideas and views can be expressed.'
p4176
aS'Sometimes they are ideas and views that we might consider noble, that advance equality.'
p4177
aS'Sometimes they might be ideas that we abhor.'
p4178
aS'But there is no way to empower a government or campus administration to restrict speech without allowing for the possibility that tomorrow, it will be our speech that is restricted.'
p4179

p4180
aS'I\xe2\x80\x99m here giving one-on-one talks called "The Unenhanced: What Has Happened to Those Deemed \xe2\x80\x98Unfit\xe2\x80\x99," about my research on Aktion T4, the Nazi "euthanasia" program to exterminate the disabled.'
p4181
aS'"I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid of what you\xe2\x80\x99re going to tell me," the neurologist says.'
p4182
aS'I\xe2\x80\x99m not surprised.'
p4183
aS'I\xe2\x80\x99ve heard similar things before.'
p4184
aS'But this time is different \xe2\x80\x94 the young man sitting across from me is a doctor.'
p4185
aS'Aktion T4 could not have happened without the willing participation of German doctors.'

p4188
aS'At the time, some thought I should not be allowed to live.'
p4189
aS'Thankfully, my parents were not among them.'
p4190
aS'I first discovered that people with disabilities were sterilized and killed by the Nazis when I was a teenager, watching the TV mini-series "Holocaust" in 1978.'
p4191
aS'But it would be years before I understood the connections between the killing of the disabled and the killing of Jews and other "undesirables," all of whom were, in one way or another, deemed "unfit".'
p4192
aS'The neurologist does not know much about what I\xe2\x80\x99m telling him.'
p4193
aS'While he does know that approximately 300,000 disabled people were killed in T4 and its aftermath, he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t know about the direct connection between T4 and the Holocaust.'
p4194
aS'He doesn\xe2\x80\x99t know that it was at Brandenburg, the first T4 site, where methods of mass killing were tested, that the first victims of Nazi mass killings were the disabled, and that its personnel went on to establish and run the extermination camps at Treblinka, Belzec and Sobibor.'
p4195
aS'Three years earlier, when I first arrived in Germany, I was consistently confronted with the treatment of those with disabilities under the Third Reich.'
p4196
aS'But I soon realized I had to go back even farther.'
p4197
aS'In the 1920s, the disabled were mistreated, sterilized, experimented on and killed in some German psychiatric institutions.'
p4198
aS'In 1920, the psychiatrist Alfred Hoche and the jurist Karl Binding published their treatise, "Permitting the Destruction of Unworthy Life," which became the blueprint for the exterminations of the disabled carried out by the Third Reich.'
p4199
aS'In Dr. Ewald Melzer\xe2\x80\x99s 1923 survey of the parents of the disabled children in his care, they were asked: "Would you agree definitely to a painless shortcut of your child\xe2\x80\x99s life, after it is determined by experts that it is incurably stupid"?'
p4200
aS'The results, which surprised Melzer, were published in 1925: 73 percent responded they were willing to have their children killed if they weren\xe2\x80\x99t told about it.'
p4201
aS'I am also Jewish.'
p4202
aS'At the Karl Bonhoeffer psychiatric hospital in the Berlin suburb of Wittenau, where the exhibition "A Double Stigma: The Fate of Jewish Psychiatric Patients" was held, I learned about, as the exhibition title suggests, how Jewish patients were doubly stigmatized by being separated from other patients, denied pastoral care, and were cared for not at the expense of the Reich but by Jewish organizations.'
p4203
aS'Jewish patients were singled out for early extermination; by December 1942, the destruction of the Jewish patient population at Wittenau was complete.'
p4204
aS'The young neurologist in Hamburg did not know this history.'
p4205
aS'It is only at the end of my talk with the neurologist that I notice he wears a hearing aid.'
p4206
aS'I want to ask if he knows about "100 Percent," the film produced by deaf Germans to show they could assimilate and be productive citizens who worked.'
p4207
aS'Did he know the hereditary deaf were singled out not only by the German authorities but also by those with acquired deafness who tried to save themselves?'
p4208
aS'Too often, even those of us with disabilities do not know our own history.'
p4209
aS'Not many people know about disability history in the United States.'
p4210
aS'They do not know that in the United States in 1927, Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes wrote that "three generations of imbeciles are enough" as part of his opinion in  , in which the Supreme Court ruled that compulsory sterilization of the "unfit" was constitutional.'
p4211
aS'This decision has never been expressly overturned.'
p4212
aS'Many Americans still do not know about the so-called "ugly laws," which in many states, beginning in the late 1860s, deemed it illegal for persons who were "unsightly or unseemly" to appear in public.'
p4213
aS'The last of these laws was not repealed until 1974.'
p4214
aS'Why is it important to know this history?'
p4215
aS'We often say what happened in Nazi Germany couldn\xe2\x80\x99t happen here.'
p4216
aS'But some of it, like the mistreatment and sterilization of the disabled, did happen here.'
p4217
aS'A reading of Hoche and Binding\xe2\x80\x99s "Permitting the Destruction of Unworthy Life" shows the similarity between what they said and what exponents of practical ethics, such as Peter Singer, say about the disabled today.'
p4218
aS'As recently as 2015, Singer, talking with the radio host Aaron Klein on his show, said, "I don\xe2\x80\x99t want my health insurance premiums to be higher so that infants who can experience zero quality of life can have expensive treatments".'
p4219
aS'These philosophers talk about the drain on "resources" caused by lives lived with a disability, which eerily echoes what Hoche and Binding wrote about the "financial and moral burden" on "a person\xe2\x80\x99s family, hospital, and state" caused by what they deem lives "unworthy of living".'
p4220
aS'Experts point out the recent Republican health care proposals would strip Medicaid funding that helps the elderly, the poor and the disabled live healthier and more dignified lives.'

aS'A recent New York Times article  , a retired Episcopal priest, as saying: "What we\xe2\x80\x99re paying for is something that many people wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t want if they had a choice. It\xe2\x80\x99s hundreds of dollars each day that could go towards their grandchildren\xe2\x80\x99s education or care for the people who could get well".'
p4222
aS'In the article, Flanders, whose father had Alzheimer\xe2\x80\x99s, is described as "utterly unafraid to mix money into the conversation about the meaning of life when the mind deteriorates".'
p4223
aS'Practical ethicists are similarly unafraid to do this.'
p4224
aS'As were the Nazis.'

aS'Three years ago, I was the only visitor at a museum dedicated to the history of the Reinickendorf area of Berlin.'
p4227
aS'The museum building was once part of Wiesengrund, which, in 1941, housed the "wards for expert care" of the Municipal Hospital for Children.'
p4228
aS'Down a hall with fluorescent lighting, in a white-walled room, were 30 wooden cribs.'
p4229
aS'On each of the cribs was a history of a child, some as young as a few months old.'
p4230
aS'This was the room in which these infants and children were experimented on and killed: the 30-bed Ward 3, the "ward for expert care" at Wiesengrund.'
p4231
aS'My heart raced; my breath shortened.'
p4232
aS'I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t stay in that room for long.'

aS'What is a life worth living?'
p4238
aS'Too often, the lives of those of us who live with disabilities are not valued, and feared.'
p4239
aS'At the root of this fear is misunderstanding, misrepresentation, and a lack of knowledge of disability history and, thus, disabled lives.'
p4240
aS'I lived through two hurricanes as a child and I remember all the good stuff that eventually came in the mail \xe2\x80\x94 M&Ms, bug spray, playing cards.'
p4241
aS'So when I heard that Hurricane Irma had made landfall on American soil last Wednesday, I began gathering those kinds of things to mail to my friends and family.'
p4242
aS'I put the packages together and watched the news.'
p4243
aS'There was nothing in what I saw about the hurricane hitting the United States.'
p4244
aS'When I finally received a text from my Aunt Cecile on Thursday, she wrote, "The post office is gone".'

aS'It took 10 more years for Virgin Islanders to actually be granted American citizenship.'
p4267
aS'Before the transfer, the Danes and the Americans argued about trading us, with one Danish lawmaker said to have risen from his death bed to vote against the sale.'
p4268
aS'Either way, the conversation about our future hadn\xe2\x80\x99t included us.'
p4269
aS'Today Virgin Islanders are led by a president who makes clear delineations between "real" Americans and all the rest.'
p4270
aS'True, the people of the Virgin Islands didn\xe2\x80\x99t vote for this current president.'
p4271
aS'The people of the Virgin Islands didn\xe2\x80\x99t vote for   president of our United States of America, because voting in the general election is not a privilege of citizenship that the federal government extends to us.'
p4272
aS'Like the citizens of Puerto Rico, Guam and the other United States territories, we are not yet   Americans.'
p4273
aS'No wonder TV networks and even the president\xe2\x80\x99s homeland security adviser, Tom Bossert, can\xe2\x80\x99t seem to get it right.'
p4274
aS'In a press briefing last Friday, Mr. Bossert appeared to chastise the news media for not covering the government response to Hurricane Irma\xe2\x80\x99s assault on the Virgin Islands.'
p4275
aS'Watching him, I held my breath, wondering if now someone would claim us.'
p4276

aS'Has been for 100 years.'
p4280
aS'In the continental United States there has been little coverage of this centennial of Virgin Islands Americanness.'

aS'In Transfer Day ceremonies in March, the Danish flag again went slowly down in the Virgin Islands and the American flag went soaring up.'
p4282
aS'All this year Virgin Islanders have been marking our Americanness with such exercises of memory, but it is a bitter celebration.'
p4283
aS'When we Virgin Islanders leave the Virgin Islands for the mainland, we find that we are immigrants in our own country.'

aS'Just 100,000 Americans, living in America\xe2\x80\x99s paradise, the United States Virgin Islands.'
p4298
aS'This month the Supreme Court will have a rare opportunity to correct a flawed doctrine that for the past two decades has relied on junk social science to justify punishing more than 800,000 Americans.'
p4299
aS'Two cases that the court could review concern people on the sex offender registry and the kinds of government control that can constitutionally be imposed upon them.'
p4300
aS'In Snyder v.'
p4301
aS'Doe, the court could consider whether Michigan\xe2\x80\x99s broad scheme of regulating sex offenders constitutes "punishment".'
p4302
aS'The other case, Karsjens v.'
p4303
aS'Piper, examines the constitutionality of Minnesota\xe2\x80\x99s policy of detaining sex offenders forever \xe2\x80\x94 not for what they\xe2\x80\x99ve done, but for what they might do.'
p4304
aS'And while the idea of indefinite preventive detention might sound un-American or something out of the film "Minority Report," the larger problem is that "civil commitment," like hundreds of other regulations imposed on those required to register, has been justified by assertions about the recidivism of sex offenders.'
p4305
aS'But those assertions turn out to be entirely belied by science.'
p4306
aS'For the past 24 years, Minnesota has detained sex offenders released from prison in a "therapeutic program" conveniently located on the grounds of a maximum-security prison in Moose Lake.'
p4307
aS'The "patients" are kept in locked cells, transported outside the facility in handcuffs and leg irons, and subjected to a regimen that looks, sounds and smells just like that of the prison it is adjacent to.'
p4308
aS'But unlike prison, this "therapeutic" program, which aims to teach the patients to control their sexual impulses and was initially designed to last from two to four years, has no fixed end date.'
p4309
aS'Rather, program administrators decide which patients are safe enough to release.'
p4310
aS'In the 24 years it has existed, not a single "patient" has ever been fully released.'
p4311
aS'There are now about 850 people in the Minnesota Sex Offender Program, some with no adult criminal record, and others who, despite having completed every single program ever offered at the facility, have remained civilly committed for over 20 years.'
p4312
aS'While civil commitment is perhaps the most extreme example of punishments imposed on people convicted of sex crimes, it is by no means the only one.'
p4313
aS'Driven by a pervasive fear of sexual predators, and facing no discernible opposition, politicians have become evermore inventive in dreaming up ways to corral and marginalize those forced to register \xe2\x80\x94 a category which itself has expanded radically and come to include those convicted of "sexting," having consensual sex with non-minor teenagers or even urinating in public.'
p4314
aS'These sanctions include being forced to wear (and pay for) GPS monitoring and being banned from parks, and draconian residency restrictions that sometimes lead to homelessness.'
p4315
aS'In addition, punishments can include, on pain of re-incarceration, undergoing interrogations using a penile plethysmograph, a device used to measure sexual arousal.'
p4316
aS'They have also included requirements that those on the registry refrain from being alone with children (often including their own) and barred from holding certain jobs, like being a volunteer firefighter or driving an ice cream truck.'
p4317
aS'And when these restrictions have been challenged in court, judge after judge has justified them based on a Supreme Court doctrine that allows such restrictions, thanks to the "frightening and high" recidivism rate ascribed to sex offenders \xe2\x80\x94 a rate the court has pegged "as high as 80 percent".'
p4318
aS'The problem is this: The 80 percent recidivism rate is an entirely invented number.'
p4319
aS'A few years ago, Ira Ellman, a professor of law at the University of California, Berkeley, and Tara Ellman set out to find the source of that 80 percent figure, and what he found shocked him.'
p4320
aS'As it turns out, the court found that number in a brief signed by Solicitor General Ted Olson.'
p4321
aS'The brief cited a Department of Justice manual, which in turn offered only one source for the 80 percent assertion: a Psychology Today article published in 1986.'
p4322
aS'That article was written not by a scientist but by a treatment provider who claimed to be able to essentially cure sex offenders though innovative "aversive therapies" including electric shocks and pumping ammonia into offenders\xe2\x80\x99 noses via nasal cannulas.'
p4323
aS'The article offered no backup data, no scientific control group and no real way to fact-check any of the assertions made to promote the author\xe2\x80\x99s program.'
p4324
aS'Nonetheless, because that 80 percent figure suited the government lawyers\xe2\x80\x99 aim of cracking down on sex offenders, Solicitor General Olson cited it, and Justice Anthony Kennedy, seemingly without fact-checking it, adopted the figure in a 2002 opinion that Justices William Rehnquist, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas joined.'
p4325
aS'(Justice Sandra Day O\xe2\x80\x99Connor concurred.'
p4326
aS') Their decision blew open the doors to the glut of sex offender restrictions that followed.'
p4327
aS'But in the 30 years since that Psychology Today article was published, there have been hundreds of evidence-based, scientific studies on the question of the recidivism rate for sex offenders.'
p4328
aS'The results of those studies are astonishingly consistent: Convicted sex offenders have among the lowest rates of same-crime recidivism of any category of offender.'
p4329
aS'Nearly every study \xe2\x80\x94 including those by states as diverse as Alaska, Nebraska, Maine, New York and California \xe2\x80\x94 as well as an extremely broad one by the federal government that followed every offender released in the United States for three years, has put the three-year recidivism rate for convicted sex offenders in the low single digits, with the bulk of the results clustering around 3.5 percent.'
p4330
aS'Needless to say, there is a tremendous difference between claiming that 80 percent of offenders will re-offend and that more than 95 percent of them won\xe2\x80\x99t.'
p4331
aS'And it is in that basic difference that the Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s doctrine has done its most lasting damage.'
p4332
aS'This profound misrepresentation of social science has led to extraordinary real-world harms.'
p4333
aS'For example, while the public almost universally embraces the strict residency restrictions the Supreme Court and lower courts have ratified, study after study has shown that rather than reduce sexual violence, these residency restrictions actually increase recidivism.'
p4334
aS'The merciless enforcement of the conditions routinely placed on those on the registry has resulted in the constant re-incarceration of offenders \xe2\x80\x94 not because they have committed new crimes but for technical violations of the conditions themselves, like failure to maintain a driving log, being late for curfew or failing to pay polygraph fees.'
p4335
aS'Indeed, a study by the California Department of Corrections concluded that 91 percent of sex offenders returned to California prisons were returned for these technical violations, while only 1.8 percent were returned as a result of having committed a new sex crime.'
p4336
aS'In short, the entire scheme of registration and restriction that the Supreme Court condoned 15 years ago in McKune v.'
p4337
aS'Lile has done enormous violence to a huge number of Americans now branded forever as sex offenders.'
p4338
aS'Now more than ever, Americans should be able to look to our highest court and expect decisions that are based on reason and grounded in science rather than fear.'
p4339
aS'The court must rule wisely and bravely, including being willing to acknowledge its mistake and finally correct the record.'
p4340
aS'More than 800,000 Americans have needlessly suffered humiliation, ostracism, banishment re-incarceration and civil commitment thanks to a judicial opinion grounded in an unsourced, unscientific study.'
p4341
aS'Simple decency and perhaps more important, intellectual honesty demands better.'
p4342
aS'Ben Shapiro is a 33-year-old who   small government, religious liberty and free-market economics and opposes identity politics, abortion and Donald Trump.'
p4343
aS'He is, in other words, that wildly exotic creature: a political conservative.'
p4344
aS'You\xe2\x80\x99d think that the cosmopolitan denizens of the San Francisco Bay Area would have encountered a few, if not in the form of an uncle at Thanksgiving, then perhaps in, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, a field trip down to Orange County.'
p4345
aS'But to judge from the pre-emptive reaction to Mr. Shapiro\xe2\x80\x99s speech scheduled for this Thursday at the University of California, Berkeley, you\xe2\x80\x99d be mistaken.'
p4346
aS'Last week Paul Alivisatos, the university\xe2\x80\x99s executive vice chancellor and provost, sent out a grave   to students and faculty members.'

p4350
aS'This time around, the activist group Refuse Fascism, which has   the left-wing extremist   movement as "courageous," has taken the lead in condemning Mr. Shapiro\xe2\x80\x99s speech, calling him a "fascist" on campus fliers and declaring in a Facebook post that his goal was to "spread ugly fascist views dressed up in slick-talking \xe2\x80\x98intellectual\xe2\x80\x99 garb".'
p4351
aS'The group has   a rally during Mr. Shapiro\xe2\x80\x99s talk.'

aS'Yet this sharp-tongued Never Trumper was also, according to the Anti-Defamation League, by far the   Jewish journalist of 2016 \xe2\x80\x94 quite a distinction when you think about the kind of vitriol that gushed forth this past year on platforms like Twitter.'

aS'Let\xe2\x80\x99s hope the protest against this "fascist" who has been the regular target of actual ones doesn\xe2\x80\x99t result in any violence.'
p4360
aS'But the brouhaha over Ben Shapiro is significant not because of what might go down Thursday at Berkeley, but because it is a perfect exhibition of a much broader phenomenon increasingly apparent in the wake of the Charlottesville, Va., demonstrations last month: the sloppy conflation between actual white supremacists and, well, run-of-the-mill conservatives, libertarians and classical liberals whose main beef is with some on the left who seem like they\xe2\x80\x99d rather do without the First Amendment.'
p4361
aS'What happened at the Unite the Right protest in Charlottesville was the real article: a gathering of proud white supremacists, neo-Nazis and fellow travelers brandishing torches and flags and a Dodge Challenger in order to terrify residents, kill a counterprotester and injure 19 others.'

aS'Perhaps one of the reasons Mr. Gibson had to make his intentions   is that in the past his events have attracted just the kind of people who are fans of anti-Semites and racists like Mr. Spencer: the "Western-chauvinist"  ; the alt-right group  , or I.E., which was founded last year by Mr. Damigo; plus fans of conspiracy theorists like Alex Jones.'
p4369
aS'Mr. Gibson had also assembled a list of speakers that included, according to the group\xe2\x80\x99s  , only one white male.'
p4370
aS'The others were Hispanic, black, Asian, Samoan and Muslim; two were women.'
p4371
aS'Mr. Gibson himself is half-Japanese.'
p4372
aS'You wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have known any of this though, if you\xe2\x80\x99d listened to news reports or politicians, as Matt Labash pointed out in his   about the event in The Weekly Standard.'
p4373
aS'Representative Nancy Pelosi   the event "a white supremacist rally" and criticized the National Park Service for giving Patriot Prayer a permit to gather in Crissy Field, not far from the Golden Gate Bridge: "They\xe2\x80\x99re going to give it as a venue to Nazis and white nationalists".'
p4374
aS'Senator Dianne Feinstein lent an amen with her own letter to the Park Service voicing her   that the park would "be used as a venue for Patriot Prayer\xe2\x80\x99s incitement, hate and intimidation".'
p4375
aS'State Senator Scott Wiener   Patriot Prayer an "extremist group," insisting that it was "not interested in simply exercising free speech" with its event, but rather in creating "a volatile, chaotic, violent tinderbox".'
p4376
aS'San Francisco\xe2\x80\x99s mayor, Ed Lee, asked residents to avoid "engaging with members of Patriot Prayer" lest anyone "dignify their message of hate and their mission of division in our city of love of compassion".'
p4377
aS'In the end, however, the   didn\xe2\x80\x99t emanate from Mr. Gibson\xe2\x80\x99s camp, but from antifa groups that   to kick some fascist butt.'
p4378
aS'Meantime, Mr. Gibson said things like "moderates have to come together".'
p4379
aS'Strange words for an accused fascist.'
p4380
aS'But when mainstream politicians are engaging in  , should Mr. Gibson\xe2\x80\x99s branding as such come as any surprise?'
p4381
aS'One of my favorite things on YouTube is the famous 1965 debate between James Baldwin and William F. Buckley at Cambridge University.'
p4382
aS'Baldwin wiped the floor with Buckley before the all-white British audience \xe2\x80\x94 the yeas   the nays 540 to 160 on the proposition "The American dream is at the expense of the American Negro".'
p4383
aS'Can anyone doubt that if Buckley tried to argue the same point today he would have been pelted with a  , or shouted down, or   or worse?'
p4384
aS'Perhaps he would have just avoided the tiresome indignity by canceling the talk.'

aS'Nineteen sixty-seven may have been a brutal year in Vietnam \xe2\x80\x94 tens of thousands of Vietnamese and more than 11,000 Americans lost their lives in what increasingly looked like an endless war \xe2\x80\x94 but it was also, the United Nations decreed more hopefully, International Tourist Year.'
p4388
aS'The National Tourist Office of the Republic of Vietnam \xe2\x80\x94 yes, the American-backed South Vietnamese government maintained a tourism office during the war \xe2\x80\x94 issued a cheerful guidebook touting the conflict-ravaged country as an enticing destination.'
p4389
aS'With its sophisticated mountain resorts, fine white beaches, extensive hunting reserves and numerous other attractions, Vietnam was "rapidly becoming a \xe2\x80\x98must see\xe2\x80\x99 for thousands of foreign tourists," it maintained.'
p4390
aS'The claim was, of course, ludicrous.'
p4391
aS'Few tourists were making the trip to Vietnam by 1967, and those who did largely stuck to the capital.'
p4392
aS'"It\xe2\x80\x99s rather risky to go far from Saigon," the chief tourism official conceded that spring.'
p4393
aS'Yet the guidebook\xe2\x80\x99s publication, as bizarre as it may seem, reminds us of the extent to which tourism was about far more than travel.'
p4394
aS'For both the Republic of Vietnam and the United States, tourism contained an important political dimension.'
p4395
aS'There was a time, in the late 1950s and early \xe2\x80\x9960s, when Vietnam did attract thousands of pleasure-seeking visitors.'
p4396
aS'Holiday magazine profiled the country in 1957, and Travel magazine did a piece on Vietnam\xe2\x80\x99s "spectacular" sites two years later.'
p4397
aS'By the early 1960s, South Vietnam was enjoying tens of thousands of foreign visitors.'
p4398
aS'This was great news for both Washington and Saigon.'
p4399
aS'Not only would tourism promote the economic development and foreign-currency earnings that were so crucial to the South Vietnamese nation-building project, but, officials hoped, it also could generate positive views of the Republic of Vietnam and its contribution to Washington\xe2\x80\x99s Cold War mission.'
p4400
aS'This was true of both the in-country experiences of foreign tourists as well as the ideologically inflected literature they relied on to mediate their travel.'
p4401
aS'In the years following the 1954 Geneva Accords that temporarily divided Vietnam, the South Vietnamese authorities, using tourism as one of the tools in their soft-power arsenal, attempted to overcome the crisis of legitimacy that imperiled their fledgling state.'
p4402
aS'The republic\xe2\x80\x99s first president, Ngo Dinh Diem, was deeply unpopular, but both independent and government-produced tourism publications overlooked his political shortcomings in favor of a Cold War narrative that portrayed Diem as an effective nation-builder and one of the free world\xe2\x80\x99s greatest assets.'
p4403
aS'The Communist hordes in Vietnam, one American guidebook insisted, sought nothing less than "to enslave the entire population".'
p4404
aS'Fortunately, Diem \xe2\x80\x94 "a man of great vigor, vision and iron will" \xe2\x80\x94 was there to stop them, "Olson\xe2\x80\x99s Orient Guide" continued.'
p4405
aS'The tourism publications of the 1950s and \xe2\x80\x9960s consistently touted the American-backed government\xe2\x80\x99s alleged democratic credentials while delegitimizing the Vietnamese revolution as naked Communist aggression.'
p4406
aS'The southern republic was thus "Free Vietnam," according to Travel magazine.'
p4407
aS'The Democratic Republic of Vietnam, conversely, was the "Communist-dominated" or "Communist-held North".'
p4408
aS'None of this is particularly surprising in the context of Cold War ideology.'
p4409
aS'But it underscores a largely overlooked facet of the Vietnam War: Tourism and its attendant literature played a surprising yet significant role in wartime propaganda.'
p4410
aS'Not only did this literature frame the political unrest in the South for travelers hungry for information, but it was also disseminated outside Southeast Asia.'
p4411
aS'The "Guide to Viet-Nam" published by South Vietnam\xe2\x80\x99s Washington embassy, for example, was ostensibly created for tourists and, generously sprinkled with attractive photographs, included all sorts of information on the points of interest, festivals and Vietnamese culture certain to appeal to foreign visitors.'
p4412
aS'Yet the 40-page guide, which touted the "free democratic system in the South" and the instrumental role it played in "the ideological contest between the Communist and the Free Worlds," was also distributed to hundreds of American schoolteachers for use in their classrooms.'
p4413
aS'The growing importance of tourism publications was consistent with the diplomatic significance the United States attached to international travel in the 1950s, as the jet age and the growth of the middle class enabled hundreds of thousands of Americans to begin venturing abroad.'
p4414
aS'Most of them knew little of the political complexities and nuances of decolonization, making the travel literature on which they relied that much more important.'
p4415
aS'It would explain the world they were seeing and experiencing.'
p4416
aS'For most tourist publications, the leftist revolutions springing up in Asia, Africa and Latin America became instances of Communist subversion, and Communism, Americans were told, required a "free world" response.'
p4417
aS'The growth of international travel in the 1950s also meant ideologically preparing Americans to serve as unofficial ambassadors for their nation.'
p4418
aS'The Eisenhower administration underscored this obligation by issuing a presidential letter to all American passport holders in 1957.'
p4419
aS'It stressed tourists\xe2\x80\x99 role in helping to "mold the reputation of our country," bringing "assurance to the people you meet that the United States is a friendly nation and one dedicated to the search for world peace and to the promotion of the well-being and security of the community of nations".'
p4420
aS'But tourism did not benefit only Washington.'
p4421
aS'For the government in Saigon, the positive experiences of American tourists and the stories they subsequently told about their visits could be a diplomatic boon.'
p4422
aS'As a motto of the National Tourist Office put it, tourism would "make the country better known and thus better loved".'
p4423
aS'For a time, things seemed to go as planned.'
p4424
aS'The American actor George C. Scott, for example, went to Vietnam in 1965 and meditated on his experience in Esquire magazine.'
p4425
aS'"Whether we like it or not, we are and have been for years at war with International Communism," he wrote.'
p4426
aS'"The Vietnamese conflict is a unique and necessary phase of that larger war, the consequences of which may not be sidestepped, or shirked, or diplomatized under a polished table".'
p4427
aS'The Follett family of Oak Park, Ill., made the trip the following year.'
p4428
aS'"We came because we wanted to see what was happening in Vietnam ourselves," Dwight Follett told Saturday Review.'
p4429
aS'"In the United States, everything we read is either black or white".'
p4430
aS'His assessment?'
p4431
aS'"I\xe2\x80\x99m coming out of this more a hawk than a dove. We must help these people".'
p4432
aS'By 1967, with the war\xe2\x80\x99s continuing escalation, the flow of tourists into the country, already seriously diminished, had nearly dried up.'
p4433
aS'The publisher Fodor\xe2\x80\x99s, whose annual guidebooks proved some of the most popular of the mid-20th century, explained why.'
p4434
aS'After offering tepid encouragement about seeing Vietnam through 1966, its 1967 prognosis was grim: "This divided nation, torn by war for twenty years, is the most dangerous country in the world for today\xe2\x80\x99s visitor".'
p4435
aS'Its advice?'
p4436
aS'"Don\xe2\x80\x99t ever yield to the temptation" to go.'
p4437
aS'Most didn\xe2\x80\x99t.'
p4438
aS'More than 34,000 foreign civilians did arrive in Vietnam in 1967, but they were almost exclusively businesspeople, journalists, contractors and government officials.'
p4439
aS'Actual sightseers numbered, at most, in the low hundreds.'
p4440
aS'And they largely remained in Saigon.'
p4441
aS'This was quite a departure from the early years of the nation-building project.'
p4442
aS'As the 1960s folded into the 1970s, things only got worse.'
p4443
aS'The ideological appeal of tourism seemed a thing of the past.'
p4444
aS'Indeed, by 1973, the year the last American combat forces withdrew, the director of the National Tourist Office took to openly encouraging the prostitution of Vietnamese women.'
p4445
aS'"Soon I will send up a proposal for \xe2\x80\x98sex tourism,\xe2\x80\x99 " he told an American reporter.'
p4446
aS'"Many people want to visit Vietnam not to see the mountains or the shopping but to try, just once, our girls".'
p4447
aS'This was the moral abyss into which Vietnamese tourism, like the American war it served, had sunk.'
p4448
aS'It\xe2\x80\x99s little wonder that the revolution prevailed.'
p4449
aS'Technology threatens to fundamentally change the nature of elections and democratic governance.'

p4453
aS'Democratization, which had advanced steadily for decades, is now threatened by the rise of authoritarian governments and the closing of the political space to civil society, journalists and others.'

aS'We must accommodate these changing times while holding true to our unchanging principles \xe2\x80\x94 equality, justice and freedom for all.'
p4459
aS'This means building political processes that are inclusive and transparent and that hold those in power accountable.'
p4460
aS'In the United States, our path has been nonlinear and riddled with failures, including slavery, racial and sexual discrimination, and abuse of indigenous peoples.'
p4461

aS'Genuine elections are essential for people to express their political will, but elections cannot guarantee democratic governance.'
p4469
aS'This will be even more true as digital technology advances.'
p4470
aS'It\xe2\x80\x99s essential that we manage these changes within the broader framework of strengthening our commitment to human rights and democracy \xe2\x80\x94 not to threaten self-governance, but rather to safeguard it.'
p4471
aS'This means improving systems for inclusive and effective political participation, including full and easy (or even automatic) access to voter registration processes and appropriate identification for all.'

aS'This is especially critical for groups that have faced  , including women, racial and ethnic minorities, indigenous people, the elderly, the disabled and those living in extreme poverty.'
p4473
aS'Transparency in elections and political processes is needed to build trust and popular confidence.'
p4474
aS'Voters must be able to freely examine key information about governance and about electoral processes and results.'
p4475
aS'For example, in the United States, voting technologies should include paper trails that can be audited; there should be fewer barriers to independent nonpartisan observers; and the results of audits and reviews should be readily available to the public.'
p4476
aS'Effective voter participation in governance and policy-making in the digital era will require additional protections for rights and freedoms such as freedom of expression and association and access to information \xe2\x80\x94 including the internet.'
p4477
aS'Citizens will need better tools to assess the quality and accuracy of information, such as fact-checking apps that crosscheck information against recognized sources and databases.'
p4478
aS'We must also develop legal frameworks and technological systems that protect privacy and the security of our personal information, with processes for independent oversight.'
p4479
aS'People must be able to learn what data is being gathered about them and who has access to it.'
p4480
aS'We must understand how all of this information is being used by media, corporations, governments and others to shape political views and behavior, and develop and implement standards and codes of practice to ensure that this does not undermine our common principles.'

p4482
aS'More than 25 years after the collapse of the Soviet Union and the attempt to build a democracy in its place, Russia has once again become an authoritarian state.'
p4483
aS'The same inability to build democratic institutions plagued the leaders of the February Revolution of 1917, which led to the Bolsheviks gaining power later that year.'
p4484
aS'Russian authoritarianism has profound consequences not just for Russian citizens, but also for neighboring countries and the rest of the world.'
p4485
aS'Still burdened by a "besieged fortress" mentality, the Kremlin pursues a foreign policy aimed at achieving a "balance of forces" between Moscow and the West.'
p4486
aS'This outdated strategy creates a hysteria for military adventurism that threatens the entire planet.'
p4487
aS'Pro-Kremlin propagandists such as  , a well-known state TV host, have even suggested that "aggressive behavior" from the United States could prompt a nuclear response from Russia.'

aS'It is not surprising that the Kremlin is using   and other   to sow confusion in Western countries and undermine faith in democratic systems.'
p4489
aS'Russia\xe2\x80\x99s leaders are convinced that Western democracy is a threat to the authoritarian order in a country they have cowed into submission.'
p4490
aS'For Moscow, this is a zero-sum game: Any weakening or discrediting of democracy can benefit only the Kremlin\xe2\x80\x99s system of rule.'
p4491
aS'But this is shortsighted.'
p4492
aS'The rupture of the Western alliance could create serious instability throughout the world, exposing Russia to dangers it would likely be unable to manage.'
p4493
aS'To find an alternative system of government, Russian democrats like myself need to make sense of our country\xe2\x80\x99s unfortunate history.'
p4494
aS'Doing so raises the inevitable question: Do Russia\xe2\x80\x99s size, political culture and distrust of the Western world make it unsuitable for democracy?'
p4495
aS'Absolutely not.'
p4496
aS'I reject the fallacy that Russians are somehow incapable of building democratic institutions.'
p4497

aS'The majority of Russians have never experienced democratic institutions and don\xe2\x80\x99t understand how they function.'

p4502
aS'They see how democracy protects individual rights and property, and allows societies to flourish.'

aS'Despite an insufficient understanding of democratic practices, Russia today has tens of thousands of civic organizations defending civil rights.'
p4504
aS'A 2012   from the Pew Research Center showed that a majority of Russians support honest elections and a fair judiciary.'
p4505
aS'The Russian people want their voices heard and their leaders held accountable: They want a different political system.'
p4506
aS'To avoid the mistakes of the past, we need to determine why Russia\xe2\x80\x99s two attempts to establish democracy in the 20th century led to new authoritarian regimes.'
p4507
aS'In both cases, having overthrown one tyrant \xe2\x80\x94 the czar in 1917 and communism in 1991 \xe2\x80\x94 Russia ended up handing over power to another.'
p4508
aS'How did this happen?'
p4509
aS'At the beginning of the 20th century, conservatives and liberals were unable to find a common language to discuss a democratic foundation for Russia.'
p4510
aS'As a result, the most reactionary faction within the governing elite came to dominate after the revolution of 1905, stymieing the development of democratic reforms.'
p4511
aS'After the overthrow of the czar in 1917, democracy once again lost out.'
p4512
aS'The Bolsheviks were in essence just as autocratic as the reactionaries who came before them, only with the opposite "ideological polarity".'
p4513
aS'They may have managed to swap the minus and plus signs in a few places, but the Bolsheviks were never able to break free of the magnetic field of Russian authoritarianism.'
p4514
aS'History repeated itself with the rise of Boris Yeltsin, even though he was Russia\xe2\x80\x99s first popularly elected leader.'
p4515
aS'In the early 1990s, the new president was granted extraordinary constitutional powers, with victorious liberals referring to Mr. Yeltsin as "czar".'
p4516
aS'When Vladimir V. Putin was first elected president in 2000, the former K.G.B. lieutenant colonel inherited a system perfectly designed to sustain Russia\xe2\x80\x99s authoritarian traditions.'
p4517
aS'A significant part of the Russian opposition today, unlike opposition movements in the West, sees democratic rights as emanating not from balanced political representation, but from the appointment of a "good czar".'
p4518
aS'This tendency to pursue a magnanimous ruler instead of democratic institutions forces ambitious political leaders to seek public support by relying on the force of their own personality rather than on a clear political program.'
p4519
aS'To win, politicians need to create an image of a "strong leader".'
p4520
aS'The challenge facing democratically minded Russians therefore isn\xe2\x80\x99t simply to remove Mr. Putin from power; it\xe2\x80\x99s to replace the authoritarian system he personifies.'
p4521
aS'The events of 1917 and 1991 teach us that the Kremlin cannot establish democracy by decree, and that democratic institutions will not spring up across the whole of Russia\xe2\x80\x99s territory at once.'
p4522
aS'The process must begin with the political transformation of European-oriented Russia and its cities: Moscow, St. Petersburg, Yekaterinburg and Novosibirsk, among others.'
p4523
aS'These urban centers can demonstrate to the rest of the country how a majority of the voters can respect the minority, and vice versa, by bringing decision-making closer to the people and by holding officials genuinely accountable.'
p4524
aS'When Russian society becomes aware of its own power, its people will find the will to develop a dynamic local democratic culture and the institutions required to support it.'
p4525
aS'The most important task is to create a justice system based on the rule of law rather than on arbitrary power.'
p4526
aS'To the Kremlin, these ideas are heresy: They undermine the centuries-old beliefs that Russia can be effectively governed only from Moscow and that the delegation of power will lead to chaos.'
p4527
aS'We must embrace a new and radically different form of governance if we want Russia to be a successful, respected country able to make a positive contribution to international relations.'
p4528
aS'The 1990s teach us another lesson: that it is the Russian people, and the Russian people alone, who must find their own way forward.'
p4529
aS'The West cannot do it for us.'

aS'For the first time in a generation, there is widespread anxiety about the possibility of nuclear war, stimulated by the extreme tensions between North Korea and the United States.'
p4531
aS'Secretary of State Rex Tillerson has advised Americans that they can   at night, a reassurance that most people probably wish they did not need to hear.'
p4532
aS'Mr. Tillerson offered his soothing counsel to deflate media hype about recent threats and counterthreats exchanged between Pyongyang and Washington.'
p4533
aS'His words also reflect profound unease about the temperament and judgment of the two leaders who could trigger inadvertent war: President Trump and Kim Jong-un.'
p4534
aS'Mr. Trump and Mr. Kim appear to believe that bombast serves their domestic needs.'
p4535
aS'Both seem to think that they can dominate and intimidate through the direst of threats.'
p4536
aS'However, words can easily have consequences that neither leader seems to grasp.'
p4537
aS'Should we be living in a world where two leaders can stumble into a nuclear holocaust?'
p4538
aS'North Korea\xe2\x80\x99s accelerated pursuit of nuclear weapons clearly requires a much-enhanced containment and deterrence policy by the United States and its allies to prevent Mr. Kim from undertaking ever-riskier options.'
p4539
aS'But what can be done to constrain the actions of an American president   is now openly questioned, even by the Republican chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Bob Corker of Tennessee?'
p4540
aS'To limit the possibilities of an almost unimaginable conflict, there is a need to pursue a long overdue legislative remedy.'
p4541
aS'Under Article I of the Constitution, only Congress can declare war.'
p4542
aS'Yet during America\xe2\x80\x99s numerous wars since World War II, presidents have never sought such authorization.'
p4543
aS'The major reason?'
p4544
aS'Nuclear weapons.'
p4545
aS'There was widespread agreement that the president needed maximum flexibility to respond to a Soviet attack and that involving Congress would cause undue delays in a moment of crisis.'
p4546
aS'As a result, the president has had essentially unchecked power to wage war, including launching a nuclear strike.'
p4547
aS'However, strategic planners understood the risks of enabling a single officer in a silo in North Dakota, perhaps under the most stressful conditions imaginable, to initiate a nuclear strike.'
p4548
aS'The nuclear command-and-control system therefore entailed a "two key" system requiring simultaneous actions by two officers to activate a launch.'
p4549
aS'The time is long overdue to introduce comparable checks at the highest levels of the executive branch.'
p4550
aS'The strategic circumstances faced by the United States today are altogether different from those during the Cold War.'
p4551
aS'Despite heightened tensions triggered by Russian revanchism in Ukraine and elsewhere in Central and Eastern Europe, the real risk of nuclear war emanates from a rogue actor, and North Korea heads the list.'
p4552
aS'Almost casual presidential invocations of fire and fury have rendered circumstances far more dangerous.'
p4553
aS'The United States should in no way diminish its ability to respond to a nuclear or conventional attack by North Korea against United States territory or the territory of an ally.'
p4554
aS'However, we should put in place a system of constraints to ensure that a preventive or pre-emptive nuclear strike by the United States must be evaluated through a careful, deliberative process.'
p4555
aS'Congress should therefore amend the War Powers Act to cover the possibility of preventive or pre-emptive nuclear strikes.'
p4556
aS'This would ensure that the president could not simply provide the codes to his military aide carrying the nuclear "football" and launch such an attack on his own authority.'
p4557
aS'Legislation should provide for a small group of officials, possibly including the vice president, the secretary of defense, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the four leaders of the House and Senate, to give unanimous consent to any such nuclear strike.'
p4558
aS'It would ensure that multiple sets of eyes, equipped with stable emotions and sound brains, would be able to prevent such a nuclear strike undertaken without appropriate deliberation.'
p4559
aS'This proposal would raise difficult constitutional questions.'
p4560
aS'All presidential administrations have deemed the War Powers Act to be unconstitutional.'
p4561
aS'Giving officers appointed by the president and subject to his direction formal veto power over military decisions could be problematic and precedent setting.'
p4562
aS'If so, confining the veto power to the congressional leadership might be a preferable alternative.'

aS'Even during the Cold War, there was great risk in ceding to one person the ability to kill millions in a flash.'
p4564
aS'There is no good reason to enable an American president to retain absolute authority in circumstances completely unlike those faced during the Cold War.'
p4565
aS'Assurances that nuclear weapons remain an option of absolute last resort, to be considered only after the concurrence of leaders from the executive branch and from the Congress, would also calm the nerves of United States allies deeply troubled by loose talk about the resort to nuclear weapons.'
p4566
aS'This is not to suggest that President Trump nurses some secret desire to launch a nuclear attack.'
p4567
aS'However, the United States needs to act very prudently in dealing with an isolated and uniquely adversarial state.'
p4568
aS'For its part, Congress has the power to prevent hair-trigger responses or impulsive actions that could lead to nuclear war.'

aS'In June 1967, in the freewheeling spirit of the times, I dropped out of Antioch College, in Ohio, and hitchhiked to New York.'

p4574
aS'I floated into that summer in a luminous haze of artistic impulse, magical thinking and pot smoke.'
p4575
aS'But by September, things were darkening.'
p4576
aS'Reality \xe2\x80\x94 menace \xe2\x80\x94 began to intrude.'

aS'I found a focus.'
p4578
aS'I joined the staff of Students for a Democratic Society, the principal organization of the New Left; I became an organizer.'

aS'By year\xe2\x80\x99s end, I was calling myself a revolutionary.'
p4580
aS'Two years later, I would help found the militant Weatherman group, a breakaway faction of the S.D.S. Weatherman picked ruinous sectarian fights within S.D.S., and violent street battles with the cops.'

aS'By then, I was no longer the gentle hippie of 1967.'
p4583
aS'But it was actually during 1967 that I changed.'
p4584
aS'I had come to New York with a notion to get into theater \xe2\x80\x94 to be a stage manager or lighting designer, an actor or dancer.'
p4585
aS'I took some classes, participated in some workshop productions.'
p4586
aS'I crashed with a friend on East 11th Street, between Avenues B and C. That was still called the Lower East Side; its tony rebranding as the East Village came later.'
p4587
aS'It was a rough, polyglot slum, buildings decaying and pavements strewn with the fragments of shattered windshields.'
p4588
aS'But this was supposed to be the Summer of Love.'
p4589
aS'For a while I acted as if I were in San Francisco, as if there were flowers in my hair.'

p4593
aS'I recall idly dropping light bulbs down our own 11th Street air shaft, just to hear the experimental music of small implosions and tinkling glass.'

p4598
aS'It was actually a song of broken romance.'
p4599
aS'I misheard it as political commentary, because crashing into bitter reality felt like what was happening.'

p4605

p4606
aS'My earliest political gestures had been for civil rights.'
p4607
aS'Now the riots in black communities \xe2\x80\x94 the rage that fueled them, and the authorities\xe2\x80\x99 savage responses \xe2\x80\x94 made that nonviolent movement and its legal achievements seem hollow.'
p4608
aS'They weren\xe2\x80\x99t hollow.'
p4609
aS'But I was 19, impatient and getting angry.'
p4610
aS'The escalating war and ostensible powerlessness of its growing opposition was making me angrier.'
p4611
aS'Some half a million people \xe2\x80\x94 roughly equal to the number of American troops deployed by then in Vietnam \xe2\x80\x94 had joined a national antiwar mobilization in April.'
p4612
aS'In June, 15,000 people marched on a Los Angeles hotel where the president was speaking; they were attacked by 1,500 riot police \xe2\x80\x94 white people, liberals, beaten by cops.'

aS'I received an immediate, permanent deferment because a shrink I\xe2\x80\x99d been seeing wrote a letter explaining that I was homosexual.'
p4617
aS'I was glad to have an out, but it was so humiliating to admit to being gay, back then, that for years I lied to anyone who asked, even close friends.'
p4618
aS'I pretended the letter only said I was crazy \xe2\x80\x94 a lesser shame.'
p4619
aS'I was angry about all that, too.'
p4620
aS'In September, I moved into my first solo apartment, a grim cell on East 6th Street.'
p4621
aS'Soon I had a pair of pivotal experiences.'
p4622
aS'I may be reversing their order, but they were so close in time and correlated in effect that it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter.'
p4623
aS'The pivot in question was that from fear to bravado.'
p4624
aS'One evening I stood shaving, naked, before my uncurtained window, careless that I was on display to the street.'
p4625
aS'I have a knife!'
p4626
aS'Suddenly a young man came pounding on my door, shouting hysterically: "You insulted my mother! I\xe2\x80\x99m going to kill you".'
p4627
aS'What I could glimpse of his face was distorted by his fury and the fisheye peephole in my door, behind which I cowered.'
p4628
aS'He went away, returned again screaming threats and finally left for good.'
p4629
aS'I never did recognize him on the street, nor did a physical encounter ensue.'
p4630
aS'Still, it was terrifying.'
p4631
aS'I felt queasy until I moved again, a few months later.'
p4632
aS'Thus, for me, the Summer of Love\xe2\x80\x99s helium balloon fell to earth.'

p4635
aS'In October, I went along to Washington for a national demonstration targeting the Pentagon.'
p4636
aS'The night before the march, I joined a secret propaganda action.'
p4637
aS'People went out to spray-paint slogans on buses.'
p4638
aS'This may not seem radical, but back then cities and transit systems were not slathered in graffiti.'
p4639
aS'I went to a lot where buses parked overnight.'
p4640
aS'Access was easy; there wasn\xe2\x80\x99t even a fence.'
p4641
aS'Moving down the dark rows with my paint canister blasting felt utterly without risk.'
p4642
aS'Then I had a thought.'
p4643
aS'What if a watchman steps suddenly into my path?'
p4644
aS'Then I had another thought.'
p4645
aS'I\xe2\x80\x99ll spray him in the face and blind him.'
p4646
aS'Easy.'
p4647
aS'My commitment to pacifism had been superficial, just something I casually assumed.'
p4648
aS'It seemed inseparable from the morality and idealism of the civil rights movement.'
p4649
aS'My light-bulb moment among the parked buses was equally nonchalant.'
p4650
aS'I embraced the idea of physical action, without a care for possible consequences.'
p4651
aS'As thoughtlessly as I had supposed myself to be a pacifist, I gave myself permission for violence.'
p4652
aS'The demonstration the next day and the ones to come were increasingly combative.'
p4653
aS'I always hated confrontation, and still do.'
p4654
aS'I was always afraid in those situations.'
p4655
aS'So it may seem paradoxical that within weeks I joined the S.D.S. staff.'
p4656
aS'After that, my fear of fighting never stopped me from encouraging militance and organizing actions in which people could be hurt.'
p4657
aS'If I often avoided going toe-to-toe with the riot squad, I certainly smashed my share of windshields.'
p4658
aS'Strutting and provocation were camouflage for my fear, and for the taint of weakness most people then \xe2\x80\x94 including me \xe2\x80\x94 thought inextricable from being gay.'
p4659
aS'I immersed myself in radicalism for many reasons.'
p4660
aS'I felt betrayed by a democracy so deeply racist and unequal.'
p4661
aS'The stupefying carnage of the war repulsed me.'
p4662
aS'A na\xc3\xafve vision of communism seemed attractive.'
p4663
aS'Plus, passionate involvement replaced my untethered existence with community, a persona, a job and \xe2\x80\x94 however unrealistic \xe2\x80\x94 a life plan.'
p4664
aS'Alongside these motivations were those knottier psychological ones.'
p4665
aS'Then, as now, millions were moved to political action \xe2\x80\x94 and were often met with brutality by the state.'
p4666
aS'But few besides us chose to deliberately instigate and justify violence.'
p4667
aS'Maybe some of my comrades were more self-aware, or had less to pretend to or cover for.'
p4668
aS'I can\xe2\x80\x99t speak for them.'
p4669
aS'I only realized my own confusion of impulses years later.'
p4670
aS'I would have been an activist anyway.'
p4671
aS'But I wonder what other more creative, less destructive ways I might have found to be one.'
p4672
aS'Next month marks the seventh anniversary of the cholera outbreak that ravaged Haiti.'
p4673
aS'The disease, which can cause death within hours if left untreated, came less than a year after Haiti was rocked by an enormous earthquake that left hundreds of thousands dead and millions injured, displaced and destitute.'
p4674
aS'Haiti is prone to earthquakes and tropical storms \xe2\x80\x94 the island was spared the worst of Hurricane Irma last week \xe2\x80\x94 but the cholera outbreak was an anomaly; the disease had never before struck Haiti.'
p4675
aS'It was brought in, it is widely believed, by United Nations peacekeepers from Nepal.'
p4676
aS'One of the world\xe2\x80\x99s most infectious waterborne diseases, cholera spreads quickly and has proved extremely difficult to contain in Haiti.'
p4677
aS'Over 10,000 have died and nearly a million have been stricken to date.'
p4678
aS'But one organization has managed to nearly eradicate it in a large slum in Port-au-Prince that lacks clean water and sanitation.'
p4679
aS'One of the game changers that would surprise most people, including global health experts, was actually a building.'
p4680
aS'It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t just any building, but a very intelligently and beautifully designed one: the Cholera Treatment Center, operated by Les Centres Gheskio, an acronym that stands for the Haitian Group for the Study of Kaposi\xe2\x80\x99s Sarcoma and Opportunistic Infections.'
p4681
aS'Gheskio, founded in 1982 in the early days of the AIDS epidemic, provides primary care services free of charge to people suffering from tuberculosis, malnutrition, and other life threatening conditions in an area of the Haitian capital that is home to 60,000 Haitians.'
p4682
aS'(Gheskio is a less well-known sister organization of Partners in Health, which focuses on Haiti\xe2\x80\x99s rural population.'
p4683
aS') After the 2010 earthquake, Gheskio\xe2\x80\x99s multi-acre campus was badly damaged.'
p4684
aS'So the organization erected emergency tents to serve as a makeshift cholera treatment clinic.'
p4685
aS'Once cholera reached Port-au-Prince, patients showed up on foot or were carried in wheelbarrows, around the clock.'
p4686
aS'Cholera manifests with extreme diarrhea and vomiting.'
p4687
aS'Virtually all liquid is excreted from the body, causing victims to die of dehydration within hours of full manifestation if untreated.'
p4688
aS'It is relatively easy to treat, but patients must be rehydrated immediately.'
p4689
aS'To prevent it from spreading, infected human waste must be managed carefully.'
p4690
aS'Gheskio\xe2\x80\x99s founder, Jean W. Pape, an infectious disease specialist and native of Haiti, knew that eradicating cholera would take years.'
p4691
aS'So even as the organization struggled to keep up with the influx of patients during the first year of the epidemic, he embarked on a long-term solution: building a permanent treatment center.'
p4692
aS'Gheskio turned to MASS Design Group, a Boston-based nonprofit organization that specializes in architecture that promotes dignity and justice in resource-limited settings.'
p4693
aS'It has built hospitals, health-worker housing, schools and civic spaces around the world, including a tuberculosis hospital for Gheskio.'
p4694
aS'MASS Design began by studying the conditions inside the tents.'
p4695
aS'Tents provide relative shade and privacy but offer limited light and poor ventilation, trapping warm air and compounding the smell of bodily waste.'
p4696
aS'The materials become worn by rain, wind and sun, and must be replaced routinely.'
p4697
aS'Because of the nature of cholera, the makeshift beds, fashioned out of old fiberglass school chairs and costly army cots, also didn\xe2\x80\x99t last long.'
p4698
aS'Most problematic, Gheskio was relying on manual removal of human waste by an outside vendor.'
p4699
aS'This was both costly and risky: The organization couldn\xe2\x80\x99t ensure its disposal would not recontaminate the water table, risking the infection of others.'
p4700
aS'"We did some back-of-envelope calculations and found that over a 10-year span of time, which was then considered optimistic for how long it would take to get rid of cholera, the tents and manual waste disposal system they were then using would cost Gheskio in excess of $500,000," according to a co-founder of MASS Design, Alan Ricks.'
p4701
aS'Ricks estimated that MASS Design could build, for a comparable sum, a permanent structure that could be repurposed once the epidemic was fully contained.'
p4702
aS'So MASS Design and Gheskio joined forces to raise philanthropic funding from the Deutsche Bank Foundation, Barr Foundation and individual donors, and began work.'
p4703
aS'One important innovation, developed with Fall Creek Engineers, based in Santa Cruz, Calif., was to bring a water-purification technology to Haiti called anaerobic baffled reactors.'
p4704
aS'The reactors are a form of septic system that uses bacteria to treat sewage and contaminated water, turning it into clean water.'
p4705
aS'Reactors, buried under the cholera center, force water through five chambers, each successively increasing the level of purification.'
p4706
aS'Each week, Pape receives a detailed report on the water quality.'
p4707
aS'The system sanitizes and recycles 250,000 gallons of water annually, ensuring that the water is free enough of bacteria and other pathogens that it can be returned to the water table.'
p4708
aS'This output is supplemented by separate, large cisterns to capture rainwater for drinking.'
p4709
aS'Many other details incorporated into the center also promote health, as well as comfort, beauty and pride.'
p4710
aS'Above the reactors, for example, is a pavilion structure designed to maximize airflow.'
p4711
aS'Rather than spending money on tents, furniture or waste disposal services \xe2\x80\x94 money that leaves the local economy \xe2\x80\x94 the organizations enlisted local artisans, whose metalwork is world renowned, to create perforated metal sheets, painted a chorus of blues, to wrap the building exterior.'
p4712
aS'Waffle-like patterns of these sheets can be opened and closed to provide shade and privacy, or sealed completely during storms, as they were when Hurricane Irma neared Port-au-Prince last week.'
p4713
aS'The airflow is aided by large-diameter fans, like those in gyms and airports.'
p4714
aS'The cement floor is smooth, free of crevices where bacteria can congregate, and sealed with epoxy.'
p4715
aS'MASS Design interviewed many patients and staff members in an effort to design and create prototypes of beds that would be comfortable as well as easily sanitized and reused.'
p4716
aS'"What I love about MASS is their attention to detail," Pape said.'
p4717
aS'"They asked us everything that work and everything that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t work. But most importantly, they are problem solvers".'
p4718
aS'"The building looks absolutely extraordinary," said Roger Glass, a cholera expert who is director of the Fogarty International Center for Advancing Science for Global Health at the National Institutes of Health and has visited the Gheskio campus.'
p4719
aS'"For ventilation and coolness, it\xe2\x80\x99s tremendous".'
p4720
aS'Before encountering a hospital that MASS Design developed in Rwanda, Glass said, he had not seriously considered the relationship between health outcomes and building design.'
p4721
aS'"If you had called me seven years ago to talk about buildings and health, I would have blown you off," he said.'
p4722
aS'Today, Glass is eager to see more collaborations with human-centered design firms, like MASS Design, in the field of global health.'
p4723
aS'Comparing the treatment center to the tents, Pape is blunt: "It was like going from hell to paradise".'
p4724
aS'We realized, however, that architecture could not only help treat these diseases after the fact, but prevent the spread of disease in the first place by controlling recontamination.'
p4725
aS'Amie Shao, who helped lead MASS Design\xe2\x80\x99s work in Haiti, reflected: "When we started, our goal was simply to help Gheskio do their work better in treating their patients in a more dignified setting. In all of our work, we seek to proactively challenge many of the underlying risks and issues that global health faces".'
p4726
aS'To be sure, the cholera treatment center is not solely responsible for halting the spread in Gheskio\xe2\x80\x99s target area.'
p4727
aS'Gheskio also developed a robust water chlorination program and maintains its own factory to produce chlorine.'
p4728
aS'The organization also supports and participates in broad efforts by the Ministry of Health to raise public awareness about symptoms and the risk of contamination throughout the country.'
p4729
aS'And Gheskio joined forces with Partners in Health to get cholera vaccines approved in Haiti.'
p4730
aS'Euvichol, a vaccine that can be administered orally and lasts up to 30 days without refrigeration, costs less than $2 per dose.'
p4731
aS'"We would need a budget of less than $50 million for universal coverage for all of Haiti," Pape estimates.'
p4732
aS'Gheskio\xe2\x80\x99s Cholera Treatment Center was ultimately built for $750,000.'
p4733
aS'Pape now predicts that the organization will have recouped that cost in just three years.'
p4734
aS'Haiti needs a modern, countrywide water and sanitation system, but it\xe2\x80\x99s unclear where the money will come from.'
p4735
aS'In the meantime, Gheskio\xe2\x80\x99s center has saved many lives.'
p4736
aS'By uniquely combining patient care with on-site water treatment, Gheskio\xe2\x80\x99s center also holds lessons for other regions struggling to contain cholera or facing it in the future.'
p4737
aS'Globally, the World Health Organization estimates there are between 1.3 million and four million cases of cholera annually in 42 countries, with 21,000 to 143,000 cholera-related deaths each year.'
p4738
aS'This year, Somalia saw a major resurgence of the disease, with over 50,000 people infected.'
p4739
aS'About 1,000 died.'
p4740
aS'In the three years since Gheskio\xe2\x80\x99s Cholera Treatment Center opened, the facility has remained in constant use because those outside the organization\xe2\x80\x99s target area continue to be exposed to contaminated water.'
p4741
aS'It has admitted over 10,000 patients to date, including over 7,000 who were hospitalized.'
p4742
aS'Eighty-three percent of those patients came from outside of Gheskio\xe2\x80\x99s catchment area.'
p4743
aS'While cholera reports in Haiti were on the rise in 2015 and 2016 at upward of 25,000 cases annually, the country saw a decrease in 2017, which Pape attributes to higher-than-normal rainfall in the region.'
p4744
aS'Of the 100 beds, no more than a third were occupied at any time this year, with as few as a handful of patients at times.'
p4745
aS'The risk for outbreaks remains high, however, and the disease\xe2\x80\x99s countrywide eradication is still years away.'
p4746
aS'"Haiti\xe2\x80\x99s recently elected government, and the president particular, is focused on universal oral cholera vaccine as well as home chlorination," Pape reports.'
p4747
aS'"If we get the vaccines and if we pursue home chlorination, I truly believe we can rid of cholera within four to five years".'
p4748
aS'Is it permissible to take a selfie in front of the Kaaba during hajj?'
p4749
aS'With spotty internet, I was unable to Google the answer.'
p4750
aS'Forced to call an audible fatwa, I decided, "Yes, if indeed my intention is pure".'
p4751
aS'Fourteen hundred years ago, the Prophet Muhammad and his companions definitely didn\xe2\x80\x99t have to decide between Clarendon and Gingham filters to document the hajj pilgrimage that is recreated by Muslims each year.'
p4752
aS'But then again, they didn\xe2\x80\x99t have Instagram as I did when I went to Mecca to satisfy the pillar of my faith during the last days of August and the beginning of September.'
p4753
aS'They didn\xe2\x80\x99t have access to the air-conditioned tents that I used for shelter.'
p4754
aS'And when they gazed at the Kaaba \xe2\x80\x94 the austere black cube that represents God\xe2\x80\x99s house on earth \xe2\x80\x94 it certainly wasn\xe2\x80\x99t dwarfed, as it is now, by   that the Saudi government added to the landscape in 2012.'
p4755
aS'Awe-struck by the privilege of participating in this tradition while often agitated by the contradictions that surround it today, I made sense of the experience by sharing it \xe2\x80\x94 filtering the pilgrimage through the lens of my smartphone.'
p4756
aS'The most painful aspect of hajj wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the physical toll that came with navigating cramped space with my two million diverse fellow pilgrims, or the intense spiritual concentration.'
p4757
aS'It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the hiking-induced blisters and chafing.'
p4758
aS'It was witnessing the erasure and razing of my religion\xe2\x80\x99s culture, history and narrative by the House of Saud.'
p4759
aS'The Saudi royal family follows the revisionist and extreme ideology of Wahhabism, which preaches an interpretation of strict monotheism that is often at odds with centuries of theological scholarship.'
p4760
aS'They consider veneration and respect of most holy sites and visitations of graves as a form of idolatry.'
p4761
aS'That explains why, in their country, while the Prophet Muhammad\xe2\x80\x99s mosque and courtyard in Medina are spacious, cooled and immaculate, Jannat al-Baqi \xe2\x80\x94 a graveyard directly across from the green dome housing the remains of thousands of Islam\xe2\x80\x99s luminaries \xe2\x80\x94 looks like a set from "Mad Max: Fury Road".'
p4762
aS'There are no tombstones, just slabs of rock sticking out like middle fingers from the dirt.'
p4763
aS'If you linger too long to pay respects or offer a prayer, the mutawwa \xe2\x80\x94 religious police \xe2\x80\x94 rush you along.'
p4764
aS'When you ask them who\xe2\x80\x99s buried here, they answer, "Allah knows best," although they know the truth: the daughter of the prophet, his family members and some of his most loyal companions.'
p4765
aS'My friends and I spent hours at the prophet\xe2\x80\x99s tomb and the rawdah \xe2\x80\x94 a space between his original pulpit and grave considered by Muslims to be some of the hottest spiritual real estate on earth.'
p4766
aS'The moving experience was tempered by the awareness that most Muslims long to offer their "salaams" (prayers of peace) to the prophet, but cannot afford to visit his mosque.'
p4767
aS'Also, women are often unable to properly perform the "ziyarat" (religious visitation) there because they\xe2\x80\x99re allowed only limited access.'
p4768
aS'In Mecca, I hiked nearly an hour under the remorseless afternoon sun to visit the Cave of Hira, where the prophet is believed to have received his first revelation: "Recite"!'
p4769
aS'There are no golden signs, air-conditioning, wheelchair ramps or video presentations here.'
p4770
aS'The austere cave used to offer a clear line of sight to the Kaaba, but now the view is now obscured by that monstrous, $15 billion, Saudi-government-funded clock tower and the accompanying world\xe2\x80\x99s tallest hotel.'
p4771
aS'That tableau is a perfect symbol of the strained marriage between the house of God \xe2\x80\x94 the Kaaba, in Mecca \xe2\x80\x94 and the House of Saud, which controls everything related to the sacred mosques.'
p4772

aS'These government\xe2\x80\x99s conflicting values were on display wherever I looked: While non-Muslims are forbidden from even entering Mecca, everyone is free to eat American Hardee\xe2\x80\x99s hamburgers or KFC fried chicken, or buy a Rolex watch across from the Kaaba.'
p4776
aS'It\xe2\x80\x99s forbidden to excessively venerate the prophet and his companions, but there\xe2\x80\x99s no problem with the giant posters of King Abdulaziz, King Salman and his son, Crown Prince Muhammad bin Salman, that are all around town.'

p4782
aS'They shared the shade under their umbrellas, and sometimes even the clothes off their back with fellow pilgrims.'
p4783
aS'We were united in a shared journey: seeking to find forgiveness, mercy and salvation.'
p4784
aS'It made sense to invite fellow Muslims and friends along for a view of this often-schizophrenic experience, unfiltered through Wahhabi propaganda.'
p4785
aS'While I initially worried it might distract me from my prayer, sharing the photos and Facebook Live videos made hajj a communal experience, in the most modern way possible.'
p4786
aS'In Mecca and Medina, often through my camera\xe2\x80\x99s lens, I looked up at the heavens and at the shiny buildings, but I also looked around me and engaged with a community of believers \xe2\x80\x94 some of them with me on ground, and some of them looking at screens on the other side of the world.'

p4789
aS'The consumer credit reporting agency Equifax revealed that  , dates of birth, names and addresses may have been stolen from its files \xe2\x80\x94 just the kind of information that allows for identity theft and other cybercrimes.'
p4790
aS'I don\xe2\x80\x99t know about you, but I\xe2\x80\x99ve lost count of the number of times in recent years that I\xe2\x80\x99ve been informed by a corporation of such a breach.'

aS'I don\xe2\x80\x99t doubt that companies regret these things, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t think they care that much either.'
p4793
aS'To them it means just a few days of bad press and at most a fine that amounts to a minuscule portion of their profits.'
p4794
aS'With penalties like that, why would companies bother to make things better?'
p4795
aS'There are technical factors that explain why cybersecurity is so weak, but the underlying reason is political, and it\xe2\x80\x99s pretty simple: Big corporations have poured large amounts of money into our political system, helping to create a regulatory environment in which consumers shoulder more and more of the risk, and companies less and less.'
p4796
aS'This is a general feature of our lopsided world, but software businesses (and the technology sides of other companies) have acquired perhaps the greatest degree of impunity.'
p4797
aS'Information technology arrived on the scene only recently, so it has faced fewer of the kinds of regulations that consumers and citizens, in more progressive eras, managed to impose on other industries.'
p4798
aS'Today, almost every piece of software comes with a disclaimer on its user license that basically says that the product may not work as intended and that its maker may stop supporting it at any time, and that\xe2\x80\x99s the user\xe2\x80\x99s problem.'

aS'Some number of unexpected errors \xe2\x80\x94 bugs \xe2\x80\x94 are unavoidable in computer programs.'

aS'It would be unreasonable to allow a consumer to sue a software company every time a program suffered a glitch.'
p4803
aS'But the situation was different when the industry was younger and wasn\xe2\x80\x99t rolling in billions of dollars, as it is now.'
p4804
aS'Most software failures and data breaches aren\xe2\x80\x99t inevitable; they are a result of neglect and underinvestment in product reliability and security.'
p4805
aS'No software system can be free from bugs (or intruders), and users must be mindful of the risks.'

aS'But the inherent lack of perfect automotive safety doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean we don\xe2\x80\x99t try to make cars safer.'
p4807
aS'Obviously, people should drive more carefully, but seatbelts, airbags and better car design reduce injury enormously, and that has been great for the industry as well as consumers.'
p4808
aS'The software industry should be no different.'
p4809
aS'Perhaps the most maddening part of the Equifax breach is that the credit-rating industry is itself unforgiving in its approach to even the smallest error.'
p4810

p4818
aS'Along with news of the breach came reports that  sold $2 million worth of stock shortly after the breach was discovered in July.'
p4819
aS'In their defense, Equifax said that the executives were not aware of the breach \xe2\x80\x94 and that the amount was only "a small percentage of their Equifax shares".'

p4826
aS'Amid the vastness of Australia\xe2\x80\x99s arid red center, there is something wondrous about this monumental slab of sandstone rising dramatically out of a flattened landscape.'
p4827
aS'It is not difficult to see why Indigenous Australians saw it as a sacred place.'
p4828
aS'Uluru is not just a place of wonder and reverence.'
p4829
aS'It has become, too, a political and historical battleground, a place through which Australia has tried to grapple with its relationship with Indigenous Australians.'
p4830
aS'It was the Anangu, the original inhabitants of the region, who gave Uluru its name.'
p4831
aS'For more than a century, though, it was known to Australians of European descent as Ayers Rock, named after a 19th-century Anglo-Australian colonial administrator.'
p4832
aS'In 1985, as part of a process of reconciliation with Indigenous Australians, who had been brutally dispossessed of their lands, the government in Canberra both acknowledged the original name and returned ownership of Uluru to the Anangu, on condition that it be leased back to the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service.'
p4833
aS'Some white Australians considered the restoration of ownership unnecessary; many Indigenous people thought it insufficient.'
p4834
aS'Uluru came to symbolize the struggle for Indigenous rights and the meaning of Australian identity.'
p4835
aS'And it was symbolically at Uluru that in May this year the   met.'
p4836
aS'It was part of an official process to discuss amending the Australian Constitution to give formal recognition to Indigenous peoples.'
p4837
aS'The resulting   called for the creation of a constitutionally enshrined voice for Indigenous peoples and a commission both to supervise "agreement-making" between the government and Indigenous peoples and to enable "truth-telling" about the past.'
p4838
aS'The government has yet to decide whether to put these constitutional changes to a referendum.'
p4839
aS'The demand for recognition and a distinct Indigenous voice emerges, in part, from the historical denial of both.'

aS'Not till the 1980s did scholars such as Henry Reynolds and Lyndall Ryan  .'

p4846
aS'Conservative historians like Keith Windschuttle dismissed the critical, revisionist accounts of what became known as the "black armband" view of history and attempted to maintain the old story of Australia.'
p4847
aS'The conservatives largely lost the debate.'
p4848
aS'Today, for instance, every public event, whether an academic conference or a sporting match, is preceded by an acknowledgment of the traditional owners and of the land on which the event is taking place.'

p4853
aS'Whatever becomes of the Uluru Statement, constitutional recognition is unlikely to change any of this.'
p4854
aS'The debate about Indigenous peoples seems \xe2\x80\x94 at least to me, an outsider \xe2\x80\x94 to take place on only two registers: on one hand, silence; on the other, a romanticization of Indigenous life.'
p4855
aS'It may seem odd to speak of silence in a nation where the issue of Indigenous rights is so prominent in public life.'
p4856
aS'But silence can come in many forms.'
p4857
aS'The affirmation of Indigenous ownership at public events has become little more than a ritual incantation that allows white Australians to assuage guilt without taking the action necessary to challenge racist marginalization.'
p4858
aS'Equally troubling is the romanticization.'
p4859
aS'It has become the accepted truth that Indigenous peoples have a culture stretching back 65,000 years.'
p4860
aS'Humans have been on the continent for that long, but no culture extends over such a time span.'
p4861
aS'Today\xe2\x80\x99s Indigenous Australians no more have the same relationship to the spiritual tradition of Dreamtime stories as did those first inhabitants than modern Greeks relate to "The Iliad" in the way their ancient forebears did.'
p4862
aS'The idea of an unbroken, unchanged culture has a flip side that has always animated racists.'
p4863
aS'It was once used to portray Indigenous Australians, and other nonwhite races, as primitive and incapable of development.'
p4864
aS'Likewise with another common claim: that Indigenous people have a special attachment to the land and a unique form of ecological wisdom.'
p4865
aS'This, too, draws on an old racist trope, a reworking of the "noble savage" myth.'
p4866
aS'The fact that in contemporary debates such ideas are deployed in support, rather than denial, of Indigenous rights does not make them more palatable.'
p4867
aS'When I raised these issues with Australian academics and activists, many suggested that as someone with a European perspective, I did not grasp the nuances of the Australian debate.'
p4868
aS'That may be true.'
p4869
aS'But many of the issues are global, not local.'
p4870
aS'From America to South Africa, from India to France, questions about the legacies of colonialism, the authenticity of cultural traditions and the meaning of democracy in pluralist societies dominate public debate.'
p4871
aS'It was fascinating to read an  , one of the guiding lights of the Uluru Statement, in which he references the work of Edmund Burke and Johann Herder to buttress his arguments: two 18th-century European philosophers, the first a founder of modern conservatism, the second of the Romantic view of culture.'
p4872
aS'Both are figures whose ideas are central to European debates about multiculturalism, tradition and recognition \xe2\x80\x94 common threads that run through the discussions in different continents.'
p4873
aS'I was struck, also, by the fact that the Uluru delegates had not been elected by their communities but invited by the organizers.'
p4874
aS'In Europe, the demand for recognition for minority communities has often helped empower community leaders at the expense of the communities themselves.'
p4875
aS'It would be a tragedy if this were to happen in Australia, too.'
p4876
aS'These days, many of us would rather not be living in the present, a time of persistent crisis, political uncertainty and fear.'
p4877
aS'Not that the future looks better, shadowed by technological advances that threaten widespread unemployment and by the perils of catastrophic climate change.'
p4878
aS'No wonder some are tempted by the comforts of a nostalgically imagined past.'
p4879
aS'Inspiring as it seems on first inspection, the self-help slogan "live in the present" slips rapidly out of focus.'
p4880
aS'What would living in the present mean?'
p4881
aS'To live each day as if it were your last, without a thought for the future, is simply bad advice, a recipe for recklessness.'
p4882
aS'The idea that one can make oneself invulnerable to what happens by detaching from everything but the present is an irresponsible delusion.'
p4883
aS'Despite this, there is an interpretation of living in the present, inspired by Aristotle, that can help us to confront the present crisis and the perpetual crises of struggle and failure in life.'
p4884
aS'There is an insight in the self-help slogan that philosophy can redeem.'
p4885
aS'The beginning of wisdom here is to think about what we are doing.'
p4886
aS'We engage in all sorts of activities: reading an article in the newspaper, reflecting on life, attending a protest, preparing a report, listening to music, driving home, making dinner, spending time with family or friends.'
p4887
aS'Though all these activities take time, there is a crucial difference in how they relate to the present moment.'
p4888
aS'Using terminology from linguistics, we can distinguish activities of two fundamental kinds.'
p4889
aS'Telic activities \xe2\x80\x94 from "telos," the Greek word for purpose \xe2\x80\x94 aim at terminal states, by which they are completed.'
p4890
aS'Think of reading this article or driving home from work.'
p4891
aS'Once you arrive at the goal, you are finished: The point of the activity has been achieved.'
p4892
aS'You can do it again, but only by way of repetition.'
p4893
aS'Not all activities are like this.'
p4894
aS'Some activities are atelic: They do not aim at terminal states.'
p4895
aS'However much you reflect on life or spend time with your family, you cannot complete these activities.'
p4896
aS'Though you will eventually stop doing them, they do not aim at a point at which there is no more of them to do.'
p4897
aS'Aristotle made the same distinction, contrasting two kinds of action or praxis: kinesis and energeia.'
p4898
aS'Kinetic actions are telic and therefore incomplete.'
p4899
aS'As Aristotle wrote in his "Metaphysics": "If you are learning, you have not at the same time learned".'
p4900
aS'When you care about telic activities, projects such as writing a report, getting married or making dinner, satisfaction is always in the future or the past.'
p4901
aS'It is yet to be achieved and then it is gone.'
p4902
aS'Telic activities are exhaustible; in fact, they aim at their own exhaustion.'
p4903
aS'They thus exhibit a peculiar self-subversion.'
p4904
aS'In valuing and so pursuing these activities, we aim to complete them, and so to expel them from our lives.'
p4905
aS'Atelic activities, by contrast, do not by nature come to an end and are not incomplete.'
p4906
aS'In defining such activities, we could emphasize their inexhaustibility, the fact that they do not aim at terminal states.'
p4907
aS'But we could also emphasize what Aristotle does: They are fully realized in the present.'
p4908
aS'"At the same time, one is seeing and has seen, is understanding and has understood, is thinking and has thought".'
p4909
aS'There is nothing you need to do in order to perform an atelic activity except what you are doing right now.'
p4910
aS'If what you care about is reflecting on your life or spending time with family or friends, and that is what you are doing, you are not on the way to achieving your end: You are already there.'
p4911
aS'What would it mean, then, to live in the present, and what do we gain by doing it?'
p4912
aS'To live in the present is to appreciate the value of atelic activities like going for a walk, listening to music, spending time with family or friends.'
p4913
aS'To engage in these activities is not to extinguish them from your life.'
p4914
aS'Their value is not mortgaged to the future or consigned to the past, but realized here and now.'
p4915
aS'It is to care about the process of what you are doing, not just projects you aim to complete.'
p4916
aS'The advice is easy to misread.'
p4917
aS'To live in the present is not to deny the value of telic activities, of making a difference in the world.'
p4918
aS'That would be a terrible mistake.'
p4919
aS'Nor can we avoid engaging in such activities.'
p4920
aS'But if projects are all we value, our lives become self-subversive, aimed at extinguishing the sources of meaning within them.'
p4921
aS'To live in the present is to refuse the excessive investment in projects, in achievements and results, that sees no inherent value in the process.'
p4922
aS'To live in the present is not to avoid hard work or strife.'
p4923
aS'Alongside the projects that occupy you in your profession, or in your political life, the telic activities that matter to you, is the atelic process of protesting injustice or doing your job.'
p4924
aS'To value the process is not to flee from work or political engagement.'
p4925
aS'That is why living in the present is not an abdication of ethical responsibility or a recipe for detachment.'
p4926
aS'To focus on the telic is to focus, all too often, on the distance and precariousness of our goals: to provide health care for all, to halt the resurgence of white supremacy, to limit global warming to 2 degrees.'
p4927
aS'Consequences matter, as do activities that aim at them.'
p4928
aS'The point of political protest is to change the world.'
p4929
aS'And yet the process matters, too.'
p4930
aS'The value of standing up for what is right, of going on strike or marching in the streets, is not exhausted by the value of its effects.'
p4931
aS'It is not wholly erased by failure.'
p4932
aS'We protest in part because we see no better way to make a difference, in part to make the present count for something, whatever the future holds.'
p4933
aS'Dublin \xe2\x80\x94 Shortly after midnight on Nov. 2, 1950, when the Cold War was well underway, all the illuminated signs on Broadway and Times Square were dimmed in salute to the most prominent Western admirer of Stalin.'
p4934
aS'The Irish dramatist George Bernard Shaw had just died, and the tribute reflected the fame of plays such as "Pygmalion," "Man and Superman" and "Saint Joan".'
p4935
aS'But Shaw\xe2\x80\x99s plays were nothing if not political, and few of his American admirers could have been in doubt that his politics included support for Communism in general and for Stalin in particular.'
p4936
aS'That he was nonetheless honored in the United States is a reminder that the great divide of the Cold War was never as simple as it seemed.'
p4937
aS'Beneath Shaw\xe2\x80\x99s infatuation with Stalin, moreover, was a force that is still with us: a desire to see in Russia all the qualities that the Western democracies lack.'
p4938
aS'On the face of it, Shaw\xe2\x80\x99s idolization of Stalin is a great puzzle.'
p4939
aS'The man known around the world by his initials G.B.S. was not just a great playwright; he was arguably the single most influential public intellectual of the first half of the 20th century.'
p4940
aS'At Shaw\xe2\x80\x99s death, Jawaharlal Nehru, the first prime minister of independent India, said, "He was not only one of the greatest figures of his age, but one who influenced the thought of vast numbers of human beings during two generations".'
p4941
aS'That influence could be summed up in one bracing imperative: the duty to be a skeptic.'
p4942
aS'He challenged his readers and audiences to burst bubbles of conventional wisdom on almost every issue imaginable, from the rightful place of women to the pretensions of empires, from the glory of war to the treatment of animals, from homosexuality to children\xe2\x80\x99s rights, from religious doctrine to the treatment of the poor.'
p4943
aS'When Shaw\xe2\x80\x99s demolitions of received ideas provoked outrage and obloquy, he courageously defended his intellectual independence.'
p4944
aS'He abhorred cruelty and made mincemeat of propaganda.'
p4945
aS'And yet, he was devoted to one of the cruelest figures in the bloody annals of tyranny, and he was a willing dupe of the propaganda that projected the Soviet Union as a workers\xe2\x80\x99 paradise.'
p4946
aS'The great skeptic allowed all his skepticism to melt away when he looked at the picture of Stalin he kept by his mantelpiece.'
p4947
aS'His support was unwavering.'
p4948
aS'Neither the Great Purge nor the Ukrainian famine, nor even the pact between Stalin and Hitler, seem to have troubled his faith in the genius and historic rectitude of the Soviet dictator.'
p4949
aS'To understand this contradiction, we have to remember the power of wish fulfillment and the way Russia became for many Westerners not a place but an idea, not a mere reality but a fantasy.'
p4950
aS'In part, Shaw\xe2\x80\x99s inability to challenge the myth of Stalin as a great friend of humanity can be explained by flattery.'
p4951
aS'When he visited the Soviet Union in 1931 (accompanied by the American-born Conservative member of Parliament Nancy Astor), he was greeted in Moscow by a military guard of honor, banners emblazoned with his portrait and crowds crying, "Hail, Shaw"!'
p4952
aS'An enormous banquet was held to celebrate Shaw\xe2\x80\x99s 75th birthday.'
p4953
aS'And Stalin himself granted Shaw a two-hour-long private audience at which his guest found the dictator in "charmingly good-humored" mood.'
p4954
aS'In part, too, Shaw\xe2\x80\x99s insistence on seeing the Soviet Union as the harbinger of the great socialist utopia can be explained by the disappointments of democracy.'
p4955
aS'He had fought for decades to establish universal adult suffrage, especially for women and the working class.'
p4956
aS'Like many radical intellectuals, he was dismayed to find that many of these new voters preferred king-and-country conservatism to the socialism they were supposed to support.'
p4957
aS'Especially as the Great Depression took hold, parliaments and political parties seemed utterly ineffectual.'
p4958
aS'Stalin\xe2\x80\x99s apparent ability to move mountains and transform society with triumphant five-year plans offered an antidote to his impatience with the frustrations of democracy.'
p4959
aS'But underlying all of this, there was an even stronger impulse: the fantasy of Russia itself.'
p4960
aS'Long before the Bolshevik Revolution gave the dream a very particular political content, Shaw was primed to expect a global spiritual resurrection that would begin in Russia.'
p4961
aS'This hope was not as fanciful as it may now seem: In the late 19th century, when Shaw\xe2\x80\x99s political and artistic consciousness was being formed, Russian music, drama and literature were at the leading edge of modern Western culture.'
p4962
aS'As he later wrote to Maxim Gorky, "I myself am as strongly susceptible as anyone to the fascination of the Russian character as expressed by its art and personally by its artists".'
p4963
aS'The creation of G.B.S. owes almost as much to Russia as it does to Ireland or England.'
p4964
aS'He learned much of his political style from anti-czarist exiles in London, especially the anarchist Peter Kropotkin and the nihilist Sergius Stepniak.'
p4965
aS'Arguably Shaw\xe2\x80\x99s greatest play, "Heartbreak House," is subtitled "A Fantasia in the Russian Manner on English Themes" and was greatly influenced by Chekhov.'
p4966
aS'Above all, Shaw was caught up in the great wave of enthusiasm for Tolstoy that broke over the English-speaking world in the mid-1880s when "War and Peace," "Anna Karenina" and most of his other works appeared in translation.'
p4967
aS'Shaw called Tolstoy "the master".'
p4968
aS'His own insistence on the didactic purpose of art and his forging of a sage-like persona are pure Tolstoy.'
p4969
aS'This was not just a matter of artistic influence.'
p4970
aS'Russia became, for Shaw, a kind of alternate universe, an imaginative field in which grandiosities that he would otherwise have delighted in puncturing were given free rein.'
p4971
aS'He would have made devastating fun of anyone writing about "the Irish soul," or "the English soul," but he was happy to write without irony of "the soul of the Russian people".'
p4972
aS'When Kropotkin\xe2\x80\x99s daughter told him that "the Russians would give the world back its lost soul," Shaw did not scoff.'
p4973
aS'Rather, as he wrote to Gorky, "I quite understand that; it is not at all ridiculous to me".'
p4974
aS'It was, of course, Marx who wrote that everything in history happens twice, "the first time as tragedy, the second time as farce".'
p4975
aS'There is something tragic in Shaw\xe2\x80\x99s journey from Tolstoy to Stalin, from seeing Russia as the place to give the world back its lost soul to his eventual embrace of the Soviet project as "the only hope of the world".'
p4976
aS'But perhaps this same impulse is now with us \xe2\x80\x94 in full-on farcical mode.'
p4977
aS'Vladimir Putin is no Stalin, and the white nationalists around Donald Trump are certainly no Shaws.'
p4978
aS'But some of the same impulse is still at work: the tendency to fantasize about Russia as the vigorous counterweight to a supposedly decadent West.'
p4979
aS'There is the same impatience with the messiness and inefficiency of democracy, and it leads to the same crush on the strongman leader who can cut through the irrelevant natterings of parliaments and parties.'
p4980
aS'Shaw\xe2\x80\x99s infatuation with Russia became a full-on love affair with a Soviet autocrat, whereas the Trump bromance with President Putin appears unconsummated.'
p4981
aS'But they share a fatal attraction that both preceded and survived the Soviet Union: the allure of a faraway place where the great leader is obeyed because he embodies a people\xe2\x80\x99s soul.'
p4982
aS'The violent furor that erupted this summer over the removal of Confederate monuments in several cities was a stark reminder that Americans remain trapped in the residue of slavery and racial violence.'
p4983
aS'In confronting this difficult truth, our attention is naturally drawn to the South.'
p4984
aS'And rightfully so: The South was the hotbed of race-based labor and sexual exploitation before and after the Civil War, and the caldron of a white supremacist ideology that sought to draw an inviolable line between whiteness and blackness, purity and contagion, precious lives and throwaway lives.'
p4985
aS'As the author of three histories on slavery and race in the South, I agree that removing Confederate iconography from cities like New Orleans, Baltimore and Charlottesville, Va., is necessary and urgent.'
p4986
aS'However, in our national discourse on slavery\xe2\x80\x99s legacy and racism\xe2\x80\x99s persistent grip, we have overlooked a crucial fact: Our history of human bondage and white supremacy is not restricted to the South.'
p4987
aS'By turning the South into an island of historical injustice separate from the rest of the United States, we misunderstand the longstanding nationwide collusion that has produced white supremacist organizers in Fargo, N.D., and a president from New York City who thinks further research is needed to determine the aims of the Ku Klux Klan.'
p4988
aS'Historians of the United States are continually unearthing an ugly truth: American slavery had no bounds.'
p4989
aS'It penetrated every corner of this country, materially, economically and ideologically, and the unjust campaign to preserve it is embedded in our built environments, North and South, East and West.'
p4990
aS'Detroit is a surprising case in point.'
p4991
aS'Detroit\xe2\x80\x99s legacy is one of a "free" city, a final stop on the Underground Railroad before Canada, known by the code word "Midnight".'
p4992
aS'Yet its early history is mired in a slave past.'
p4993
aS'Near the start of the Revolutionary War, William and Alexander Macomb, Scots-Irish traders from New York, illegally purchased Grosse Isle from the Potawatomi people.'
p4994
aS'William Macomb was the largest slaveholder in Detroit in the late 1700s.'
p4995
aS'He owned at least 26 black men, women and children.'
p4996
aS'He kept slaves on his Detroit River islands, which included Belle Isle (the current city park) and Grosse Isle, and right in the heart of the city, not far from where the International Underground Railroad Memorial now rises above the river view.'
p4997
aS'When Macomb died, his wife, Sarah, and their sons inherited the family fortune, later becoming \xe2\x80\x94 along with other Detroit slaveholding families \xe2\x80\x94 among the first trustees of the University of Michigan.'
p4998
aS'The Macomb surname and those of numerous Detroit slave sellers, slaveholders and indigenous-land thieves cover the region\xe2\x80\x99s map.'
p4999
aS'Men who committed crimes against humanity in their fur trade shops and private homes, on their farms, islands and Great Lakes trading vessels, are memorialized throughout the metropolis, on street signs, school buildings, town halls and county seats.'
p5000
aS'The Detroit journalist Bill McGraw began a catalog of these names in his 2012 article " " \xe2\x80\x94 Macomb, Campau, Beaubien, McDougall, Abbott, Brush, Cass, Hamtramck, Gouin, Meldrum, Dequindre, Beaufait, Groesbeck, Livernois, Rivard.'
p5001
aS'And that\xe2\x80\x99s just a start.'
p5002
aS'Belle Isle, for instance, was named for Isabelle Cass, a daughter of Lewis Cass, a Detroit politician and governor of Michigan in the early 1800s.'
p5003
aS'Lewis Cass, a supporter of slavery, negotiated the sale of a woman he had enslaved named Sally to a member of the Macomb family in 1818, according to his biographer, Willard Carl Klunder.'
p5004
aS'The Cass family name is attached to a county in Michigan as well as one of Detroit\xe2\x80\x99s best public schools, Cass Tech.'
p5005
aS'Detroiters and visitors alike speak and elevate the names of these slaveholders whenever they trace their fingers across a map or walk the streets in search of the nearest Starbucks.'
p5006
aS'Detroit is just one example of the hidden historical maps that silently shape our sense of place and community.'
p5007
aS'Place names, submerged below our immediate awareness, may make us feel that slavery and racial oppression have faded into the backdrops of cities, and our history.'
p5008
aS'Yet they do their cultural and political work.'
p5009
aS'The embedded racism of our streetscapes and landscapes is made perhaps more dangerous because we cannot see it upon a first glance.'
p5010
aS'In Detroit and across the country, slaveholder names plastered about commemorate a social order in which elite white people exerted inexorable power over black and indigenous bodies and lives.'
p5011
aS'Places named after slaveholders who sold people, raped people, chained people, beat people and orchestrated sexual pairings to further their financial ends slip off our tongues without pause or forethought.'
p5012
aS'Yet these memory maps make up what the University of Michigan historian Matthew Countryman has called "moral maps" of the places that we inhabit together.'
p5013
aS'It is our duty to confront our ugly history in whole cloth.'
p5014
aS'Confederate monuments in the South, in all of their artistic barbarity and weighty symbolism, are but one kind of commemoration of slavery and white power among many that shape our everyday environments, influence our collective identities and silently signal what our national culture validates.'
p5015
aS'While the past does not change, our interpretations of it as we gain new evidence and insight can and should.'
p5016
aS'Collectively determining what we valorize in the public square is the responsibility of the people who live in these stained places now.'
p5017
aS'We can and must recover them.'
p5018
aS'When schools reopened in New York last week, students were greeted by teachers who had spent the summer preparing for their return.'
p5019
aS'Unfortunately, many of those teachers had had to devote some of their time not to lesson plans, but to a state teacher-certification process that emphasizes bureaucratic procedures more than real-world qualifications.'
p5020
aS'So as a teacher who recently had to jump through the New York certification hoops, I was pleased to learn that the  , which authorizes charter operators,   to certify their teachers themselves.'
p5021
aS'The comment period for the proposal closes on Monday, and the institute could approve it as early as next month.'
p5022
aS'Here\xe2\x80\x99s my story.'
p5023
aS'In February 2015, I was delighted to receive an offer from Democracy Prep Public Schools, one of New York City\xe2\x80\x99s thriving charter school networks, to join an innovative new educational program for students with disabilities called Pathways.'
p5024
aS'There was just one problem: I was not certified to teach in New York State.'
p5025
aS'That I did not possess the requisite certification did not mean that I lacked the requisite qualifications.'
p5026
aS'When I received my offer from Democracy Prep, I had already spent six years of teaching and coaching aspiring teachers in Boston and Chicago.'
p5027
aS'As a graduate of Boston Teacher Residency, an alternative teacher-preparation program based in Boston Public Schools, I am certified to teach in Massachusetts.'
p5028
aS'I also have a master\xe2\x80\x99s in education from the University of Massachusetts, Boston.'
p5029
aS'Nevertheless, because of New York\xe2\x80\x99s approach to teacher credentialing, it took 18 months, three exams, one teaching portfolio, countless hours and about $1,000 for me to get my initial certificate through reciprocity.'
p5030
aS'And I\xe2\x80\x99m one of the lucky ones.'
p5031
aS'Because I was already certified in another state, I did not have to take additional graduate courses.'
p5032
aS'Democracy Prep even reimbursed all of my application and exam fees.'
p5033
aS'Still, I found myself having to divert precious time from my work in the classroom to study for exams and compile a teaching portfolio just to demonstrate that I was a competent teacher, which I had already proved six years before in Boston.'
p5034
aS'It can be a daunting task, one that can deter great prospective teachers, or prompt already great teachers to leave the field rather than deal with the paperwork involved in getting certified in a new state or renewing their certification.'
p5035
aS'Even as charter schools become more numerous and more popular, they are having problems finding enough instructors, and so they rely on young, new teachers, often from nontraditional backgrounds, who have yet to receive certification.'
p5036
aS'Under the Charter School Institute proposal, schools would be able to design their own training programs and certify teachers.'
p5037
aS'These new teachers would have to get a minimum of 100 hours of "field experience" under the supervision of another teacher and 30 hours of "content core" instruction, among other requirements.'
p5038
aS'Many charter schools, including Democracy Prep, are already in a position to undertake such programs.'
p5039
aS'By mid-August of this year, I was headlong into summer professional development.'
p5040
aS'Teachers at Democracy Prep engage in approximately 240 hours of training throughout the school year.'
p5041
aS'I also receive constant feedback and support to improve my teaching practice and help students grow.'
p5042
aS'I am observed weekly by school leaders, instructional coaches and other network staff members.'
p5043
aS'At the end of each trimester, I sit down with my principal to review my performance and progress and to set goals for the remainder of the year.'
p5044
aS'While some unions and professors at teachers colleges have criticized the certification proposal, my experiences in schools around this country have taught me that no one actually cares where or how you learned to teach.'
p5045
aS'No one has ever walked into my classroom and asked to see my degree or questioned my qualifications; all that has mattered is the classroom environment that I\xe2\x80\x99ve helped to create, the relationships that I\xe2\x80\x99ve built with students and families, and the growth of my students.'
p5046
aS'Limiting the ability of schools to attract great teachers makes little sense.'
p5047
aS'It\xe2\x80\x99s not important to our students whether their teachers went through a traditional graduate school of education, Teach for America or a charter school training program; all that matters is that they get the very best teachers that we can give them.'
p5048
aS'Our communities, schools and students deserve the highest-quality teachers, not merely the ones with a paper certificate.'
p5049
aS'DURHAM, N.C. \xe2\x80\x94 Of the 2,753 victims of the terrorist attack on the World Trade Center on Sept. 11, 2001, no physical trace has been found for 1,112 of them.'
p5050
aS'Thus, for 40 percent of those who died that day, no remains have been returned to their families.'
p5051
aS'In the aftermath of the carnage, some people exhibited photos, family snapshots, of those who had vanished and remained unaccounted for, despite the efforts of the authorities.'
p5052
aS'What could be more natural than to seek information that would, at least, offer clarity and closure, surcease to the mind and heart?'
p5053
aS'As long as there was no body to mourn, there was always a desperate shred of belief that perhaps the loved one might somehow have survived.'
p5054
aS'Any bereavement is hard enough, but when someone has disappeared, seemingly annihilated from the face of the earth, it becomes unbearable.'
p5055
aS'When I was growing up, I had always heard the Spanish verb "desaparecer" used intransitively: "Se desapareci\xc3\xb3 mi libro," my book disappeared somewhere, my mother or my father would say, as if it had somehow mislaid itself.'
p5056
aS'Years later, after the Chilean military coup of Sept. 11, 1973, we learned a sinister new usage.'
p5057
aS'Around 1974, like others who had gone into exile to escape the dictatorship, my wife and I began to hear a transitive version of the verb: "lo desaparecieron" or "la desaparecieron," they disappeared him or her.'
p5058
aS'"Desaparecer" became a verb that, far from being passive, described a ferocious act of violence and dissimulation.'
p5059
aS'Agents of the state were kidnapping opponents of the regime and then denying their relatives any knowledge of their whereabouts.'
p5060
aS'The verb\xe2\x80\x99s new meaning was a response to a particularly cruel form of terror: Those in power were eliminating anyone they considered a threat while whitewashing their responsibility for the persecutions.'
p5061
aS'The abductors wanted to spread fear \xe2\x80\x94 Will I be next?'
p5062
aS'Will my son, my parents, my spouse?'
p5063
aS'\xe2\x80\x94 and simultaneously claim there was no human rights abuse.'
p5064
aS'But this monstrous criminality incited its own form of resistance.'
p5065
aS'The families, primarily the mothers, of the "desaparecidos," the disappeared, were not going to let their dear ones fade into the darkness.'
p5066
aS'In the years that followed, the world witnessed how those relatives stood up to the authorities, demanding that the detained be returned alive or, if they had been murdered, that their bodies be released for a proper burial and commemoration.'
p5067
aS'Emblematic of this resistance were the photos pinned to the dresses of women or held aloft on placards at rallies or silent marches that were often savagely repressed.'
p5068
aS'Though such acts of defiance had their start in Chile and Argentina in the mid-1970s, they soon became globalized, as globalized as the terror they were protesting.'
p5069
aS'Over the decades, families in Afghanistan and Myanmar, Ethiopia and Cyprus, to the more recent cases of Syria, Yemen and Mexico, adopted the same tactics, a determined attempt to memorialize the missing.'
p5070
aS'In time, it was not just the victims of political brutality who were, in some sense, kept fiercely alive in this way.'
p5071
aS'In the 1980s, after our family had moved to the United States, we were surprised to see the images of youngsters on milk cartons, placed at the behest of parents whose children had disappeared.'
p5072
aS'The context was very different \xe2\x80\x94 unlike in Chile, in America the police were allies in the search for the missing \xe2\x80\x94 but the impulse to call attention to the lost loved one was something we recognized with a shudder.'
p5073
aS'We could identify with the pain felt by those families, the uncertainty and bewilderment corroding their existence.'
p5074
aS'Despite the disparity in circumstances, the photos staring at consumers from peaceful milk cartons in the United States and the photos paraded by relatives of the desaparecidos who were beaten and jailed and persecuted for demanding justice, shared a very human trait.'
p5075
aS'They wanted to make visible the face and fate of someone who could not speak for himself or herself, and to enlist the wider citizenry in a quest for the truth.'
p5076
aS'It is that communion across borders, a bond of grief between some of the most and least fortunate people in the world, that makes the idea of bearing witness to the disappeared powerful and universal, and especially relevant right now.'
p5077
aS'At this crossroads in history, the disappearance that was inflicted on a sliver of the earth\xe2\x80\x99s population could now be perpetrated against all humanity, dragging into the void every other species as well.'
p5078
aS'The very extinction of our world, whether by thermonuclear war or from unstoppable man-made climate change, is ominously possible.'
p5079
aS'The vanishing we face would apply not just to the billions breathing at this moment, but to those we remember and those yet to come.'
p5080
aS'All of them, all of us, "desaparecidos".'
p5081
aS'In these circumstances, we should look to the families of the disappeared for guidance and courage.'
p5082
aS'Despite the price they paid for struggling against indifference and fear, they refused to let death have the last word.'

aS'Worse, these accusations were based on a mangled understanding of Ms. Barrett\xe2\x80\x99s work.'
p5106
aS'In a 1998   that has been seized on by left-wing activists, Ms. Barrett and a co-author addressed how Catholic judges might deal with capital cases, given the church\xe2\x80\x99s opposition to the death penalty in virtually all situations.'

aS'They emphasized privacy as a necessary condition for "seclusion," which in turn enables the exercise of freedoms like speech, expression and association.'
p5159
aS'The court also made clear that bodily integrity, informational privacy and privacy of personal choice is inextricably linked to democracy, dignity and fraternity, which are provided for by the Constitution.'
p5160
aS'This conception of privacy as illustrated by violations, as facilitating seclusion, and as enabling classical civil and political rights and linked to the larger political project of democracy and fraternity, is what makes the Supreme Court judgment such a watershed moment.'
p5161
aS'The judges reminded India that "the purpose of elevating certain rights to the stature of guaranteed fundamental rights is to insulate their exercise from the disdain of majorities, whether legislative or popular".'
p5162
aS'The court also cleansed its own institutional reputation by choosing constitutional morality over majoritarian morality.'
p5163
aS'An 1860 colonial law that criminalized same-sex intimacy as "unnatural sex" stayed on the books in independent India.'
p5164
aS'In 2009, the Delhi High Court annulled it, saying it violated the rights of L.G.B.T. Indians.'
p5165
aS'A few years later, the Supreme Court overruled the High Court judgment and criminalized same-sex relations again.'
p5166
aS'In the privacy judgment, the justices of the Supreme Court tore apart the homophobia of their predecessors and castigated their reasoning.'
p5167
aS'The court, though, stopped short of overruling its 2012 decision since it has yet to hear the curative petitions and constitutional challenge filed by L.G.B.T. Indians.'
p5168
aS'The judgment has also given legal and constitutional impetus to other issues before the court, including petitions arguing for criminalization of marital rape and challenges to beef bans.'
p5169
aS'The jurisprudence of choice in personal and public life will be argued as a binding constitutional principle in these cases as well as the same-sex cases.'
p5170
aS'And the privacy ruling represents a remarkable shift in the Supreme Court from a reticent post-colonial court on matters of individual liberty to an erudite constitutional court safeguarding freedom in the terrifying times of new India.'
p5171
aS'The court is showing that it will be the institution most responsible for India\xe2\x80\x99s enduring as a constitutional democracy.'
p5172
aS'A large but widely ignored presence in New York City on the eve of Sept. 11, 2001, was Hurricane Erin, its cyclonic swirl starkly visible in weather maps like an ominous asterisk just off the coast.'
p5173
aS'Two groups noticed: meteorologists, who mentioned the storm in passing, if at all, in news reports; and surfers, who chattered breathlessly about it.'
p5174
aS'The meteorologists were blas\xc3\xa9 because at no point in its journey from the tropics had Hurricane Erin threatened to make landfall, except briefly as it brushed past Bermuda, and it was now poised to be blown out to sea by a powerful cold front.'
p5175
aS'But the same winds that would be flushing the storm away from land would also be grooming the big waves that it had been steadily producing in its crawl up the East Coast.'
p5176
aS'This was to be a once-in-a-decade swell.'
p5177
aS'Surfers were, as they say, "frothing".'
p5178
aS'That these glorious waves would be arriving on a Tuesday, a workday morning, was a problem but hardly an insoluble one.'
p5179
aS'Like many other surfers in the area, I planned to call in sick.'
p5180
aS'In my case, however, this was complicated by my having recently been named director of the writing program at the college in Brooklyn where I taught.'
p5181
aS'Tuesday, Sept. 11, was the first day of classes.'
p5182
aS'I had scheduled myself to teach the main writing seminar taken by freshmen, which met at 10 a.'
p5183
aS'm.'
p5184
aS'When I pictured these eager new arrivals reading the sign posted on the classroom door announcing my absence, then turning away in disappointment, yes, I felt guilty \xe2\x80\x94 but nowhere near so guilty as not to cancel class.'
p5185
aS'A class, after all, could be made up later in the semester; a once-in-a-decade swell was an evanescent natural miracle of sorts.'
p5186
aS'I wanted to make a good first impression, a solid directorial debut, but I wanted to go surfing more.'
p5187
aS'Thus the disruptive power of surfing, which exerts an allegiance to itself and a faithlessness to the rest of the world that is capable of ending romantic relationships and terminating gainful employment at the rise of a swell.'
p5188
aS'If I had never learned to surf, Tuesday would have dawned like any other workday and I would have fulfilled my teacherly duties ignorant of the oceanic joy on offer.'
p5189
aS'But I had learned to surf \xe2\x80\x94 in the Vietnam era, in Florida.'
p5190
aS'I was a surfer before I was a writer or a teacher of writing, before, in a sense, I was a citizen.'
p5191
aS'In the surf is where I feel most at home, most alive, most at peace.'
p5192
aS'I remember as a boy looking back at shore from the lineup on a day of good waves, at the houses and stores, the cars passing along the beach road.'
p5193
aS'How foreign it seemed, how little I cared about its striving and admonitions.'
p5194
aS'On that Tuesday morning in 2001, I stood at my living room window and watched impatiently for the arrival of my surf buddy in his car.'
p5195
aS'We had been making the journey out to Long Beach, on Long Island, together for years.'
p5196
aS'He was dropping his daughter off at nursery school, then driving over to my neighborhood to pick me up.'
p5197
aS'But it was 8:45 a.'
p5198
aS'm.'
p5199
aS'and my friend was supposed to have arrived at 8:30.'
p5200
aS'I was trying not to think about the waves we were missing \xe2\x80\x94 a grinding anguish that is the dark side of surfing\xe2\x80\x99s sunny insouciance.'
p5201
aS'I lived in a faculty house on the edge of campus.'
p5202
aS'Students were now streaming past on their way to 9 o\xe2\x80\x99clock classes, colleagues and administrators pulling into the parking lot in their cars.'
p5203
aS'When my friend finally rolled up, I would have to carry my surfboard through this throng.'
p5204
aS'Nothing says "I\xe2\x80\x99m blowing off work" like strapping a board to the roof of a car.'
p5205
aS'But there was no helping that.'
p5206
aS'I was half-listening to the local public radio station as I waited.'
p5207
aS'An announcement came over the air about some kind of incident at the World Trade Center.'
p5208
aS'Then the FM signal went out.'
p5209
aS'My wife eventually found the station on AM.'
p5210
aS'A witness was reporting having seen a plane fly low across the city and into one of the towers.'
p5211
aS'We turned on the TV to find an image of a tower with gray smoke pouring from an enormous gash high up, like a fatal head wound.'
p5212
aS'Years before, I had worked in the World Trade Center, on the 82nd floor, teaching English to Japanese businessmen.'
p5213
aS'I\xe2\x80\x99d had to change elevators on the way up, like transferring on the subway.'
p5214
aS'I could remember the sunlight coming in through the narrow windows.'
p5215
aS'To see this tower burning was like looking back at the shore on that day of good waves in my youth, when I found civilian life so foreign.'
p5216
aS'Only this time I could see myself there.'
p5217
aS'I was up there in the sheer, pitiless air of the 82nd floor.'
p5218
aS'The phone rang.'
p5219
aS'It was my friend.'
p5220
aS'He said he had noticed the smoke in the sky after dropping his daughter off at nursery school.'
p5221
aS'When he got back to his house, he went up to the roof and saw a long streak of smoke with bits of white glitter in it \xe2\x80\x94 office paper, he realized.'
p5222
aS'It led all the way back to the tower.'
p5223
aS'He was weeping as he told me.'
p5224
aS'Then the second plane hit.'
p5225
aS'The college canceled classes.'
p5226
aS'I walked over to my class and told my students in person, as if I had had every intention of teaching.'
p5227
aS'I had little else to say.'
p5228
aS'I was too stunned.'
p5229
aS'They went up to the roofs of the campus buildings; I went home.'
p5230
aS'Later, I heard their shouts as first one then the other tower collapsed.'
p5231
aS'The next day there were small leftover waves from the hurricane swell.'
p5232
aS'I did what I usually do when I\xe2\x80\x99ve lost my bearings: I headed for the ocean, driving out to Long Beach on my own.'
p5233
aS'I was thinking about stories I had read on the internet about surfers who had called in sick to jobs at places like Cantor Fitzgerald and lived.'
p5234
aS'I took a wrong turn and wound up on one of the ring roads of Kennedy Airport.'
p5235
aS'When I realized my mistake, I tried to make a U-turn.'
p5236
aS'A cluster of plainclothes policemen staking out the intersection angrily waved me down, leaning into the windows of my car to ask why I turned around when I saw them.'
p5237
aS'"I got lost," I said.'
p5238
aS'I pointed at my board where it lay in the back.'
p5239
aS'"I\xe2\x80\x99m just trying to go surfing".'
p5240
aS'ABBEVILLE, S.C. \xe2\x80\x94 In September 1984, my wife, Susan, and I left Fairfield, Conn., our home for 43 years, and drove south.'
p5241
aS'We\xe2\x80\x99d had enough of New England winters.'
p5242
aS'We stopped 23 hours later in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., rented a 450-square-foot apartment on the Intracoastal Waterway a mile from the beach, and began our new life in "paradise".'
p5243
aS'Our lives revolved around the sun and the beach during the day after work, and the bars, restaurants and clubs at night.'
p5244
aS'The only downside to paradise was the influx of 375,000 crazed spring breakers from December to Easter, and the occasional hurricane from June to November, which frightened us less than did those drunken college kids diving off the balconies of motels into swimming pools, which, on occasion, they missed.'
p5245
aS'We felt we had nothing to fear from hurricanes because we had nothing to lose \xe2\x80\x94 just a rented apartment, a few sticks of thrift-store furniture and our rusted-out 1974 Alfa Romeo sedan.'
p5246
aS'When a hurricane approached, we went to the beach to watch the grayish-blue squalls swirling toward us low over the ocean.'
p5247
aS'When the winds got so strong they blew us off our feet, we hustled across the street to wait out the storm in a bar.'
p5248
aS'In those days, every bar had a "hurricane party".'
p5249
aS'Then our lives changed.'
p5250
aS'We got a dog and a parrot in the late \xe2\x80\x9980s.'
p5251
aS'Then more dogs.'
p5252
aS'We were responsible for other lives now.'
p5253
aS'We didn\xe2\x80\x99t go out much to bars anymore, especially during hurricanes.'
p5254
aS'We stayed in our apartment to comfort our terrified pets as the wind rattled our sliding glass doors close to the waterway.'
p5255
aS'By 1992, we had six shiba inu dogs and other "things of value" we had to protect: a new car and a small wood-framed bungalow, built in 1926.'
p5256
aS'A week after we signed the contract for the house we watched the Weather Channel in horror as Hurricane Andrew began its long, methodical slog across the Atlantic toward Fort Lauderdale.'
p5257
aS'We woke each morning at 4 a.'
p5258
aS'm.'
p5259
aS'for days watching the storm\xe2\x80\x99s track, hoping for a shift, but it was not to be.'
p5260
aS'The day before Andrew was to hit us, we threw our clothes in our car, four dogs in the back seat, two dogs in front \xe2\x80\x94 one on Susie\xe2\x80\x99s lap, the other on the floor between her legs \xe2\x80\x94 and our parrot in a carrying case wedged between the front seats.'
p5261
aS'Then we drove north.'
p5262
aS'When we reached Gainesville, Fla., we found a motel room off I-75.'
p5263
aS'On a little piece of grass outside, other dog owners walked every kind of dog imaginable.'
p5264
aS'This was our first hurricane lesson: In paradise, the most precious possessions of so many residents were their pets, which had replaced the family they had left behind in the North.'
p5265
aS'After Andrew had passed through, we drove back home.'
p5266
aS'Trees were down, water had sloshed up off the canal, but essentially paradise was intact.'
p5267
aS'Our bungalow was untouched.'
p5268
aS'Why not?'
p5269
aS'It had survived 66 years of hurricanes.'
p5270
aS'Over the next 13 years, we became hurricane veterans.'
p5271
aS'We learned the drill.'
p5272
aS'We watched the Weather Channel throughout the day and night from June to November.'
p5273
aS'We learned how to read the hurricanes, to separate the ones that were forecasters\xe2\x80\x99 hype from ones that were serious threats.'
p5274
aS'We had heavy-duty plywood shutters built for our windows.'
p5275
aS'We had a reliable store of batteries and flashlights, battery-powered hurricane lamps, a battery-operated radio, gallons of water, cans and boxes of food that would keep.'
p5276
aS'And bottles of vodka, for Susie, and bourbon for me.'
p5277
aS'Lots of it.'
p5278
aS'The best way to get through a hurricane thrashing against your house is to drink your way through it, wake the next day with a headache to see the wind gone.'
p5279
aS'At first, we bought our supplies three and four days before a hurricane hit.'
p5280
aS'Then we refined our strategy to a day or two.'
p5281
aS'I filled the bathtub with water we could use in the toilet when we lost power.'
p5282
aS'I cleaned and oiled our 9-millimeter pistols, then loaded them.'
p5283
aS'In 2004, three hurricanes hit us in the space of six weeks, Charley, Frances and Jean.'
p5284
aS'They each lingered off shore, one after the other, blowing at us for weeks as we sat in darkness.'
p5285
aS'We were in our mid-60s when Wilma hit in 2005.'
p5286
aS'Wilma was a beast, its force like a herd of dinosaurs thundering past our shuttered windows.'
p5287
aS'It was the first time we were ever scared for our lives in a hurricane.'
p5288
aS'Susie held our oldest dog, Kiri, who was shivering from fear.'
p5289
aS'Wilma lingered from the early morning until noon when, suddenly, it was gone.'
p5290
aS'The sun came out.'
p5291
aS'We ventured outside like cave dwellers into sunlight, blinking our eyes.'
p5292
aS'All our neighbors were outside, too, sawing fallen limbs, heaping trash and broken objects on the swale.'
p5293
aS'Paradise was never the same for us again.'
p5294
aS'Our beloved Kiri died three weeks after Wilma.'
p5295
aS'We put our house up for sale in 2008, and in March 2009, we moved into our current house, a big, old Victorian on a hill here in Abbeville, S.C.'
p5296
aS'Our real estate broker told us we would never have to worry about hurricanes again.'
p5297
aS'"Abbeville doesn\xe2\x80\x99t get weather," she said.'
p5298
aS'"The only weather we ever got was a tornado in \xe2\x80\x9973".'
p5299
aS'One night a few days after we arrived, Susie and the dogs were sleeping while I watched a movie on TV.'
p5300
aS'A narrow banner of letters rolled across the top of the screen: "Tornado warning for Abbeville County".'
p5301
aS'Three minutes later all hell broke loose.'
p5302
aS'A fierce wind rattled our old windows, and I heard the cracking of tree limbs and then their thunderous crashes to earth.'
p5303
aS'In minutes the tornado was gone and everything was still again.'
p5304
aS'My wife and the dogs slept through it.'
p5305
aS'That was the only weather we\xe2\x80\x99ve ever had in Abbeville for the eight years we\xe2\x80\x99ve lived here.'
p5306
aS'Until today, of course, with Irma bearing up on us, from Florida.'
p5307

aS'Who should have the right to define rape: survivors who have experienced sexual violence or those who are accused of perpetrating it?'
p5358
aS'That is the core question raised by Education Secretary   this month to replace Obama-era guidelines on how universities handle sexual misconduct complaints.'
p5359
aS'In a strongly worded speech, Ms. DeVos made clear that she believed the previous administration had used "intimidation and coercion" to force colleges to adopt disciplinary procedures that deprived accused students of their rights.'
p5360
aS'To come to these conclusions, Ms. DeVos and her staff appear to have given special consideration to the concerns of men accused of sexual assault.'
p5361
aS'After one hearing about campus rape policies, Candice Jackson, the top civil rights official in the Department of Education, said, "The accusations \xe2\x80\x94 90 percent of them \xe2\x80\x94 fall into the category of \xe2\x80\x98we were both drunk, we broke up, and six months later I found myself under a Title IX investigation because she just decided that our last sleeping together was not quite right. \xe2\x80\x99 " Ms. Jackson has since called these remarks "flippant," but they reveal a gross misunderstanding of sexual assault.'
p5362
aS'Ms. Jackson essentially intimated that she believes either that alcohol-facilitated sexual assault and intimate partner violence are not real or that, at the very least, they are not harmful enough to merit disciplinary action.'
p5363
aS'No wonder Ms. DeVos thinks many sexual assault complaints on campus are baseless.'
p5364
aS'According to Ms. Jackson\xe2\x80\x99s incorrect logic, almost any college man facing disciplinary proceedings would be falsely accused.'
p5365
aS'And yet there is plenty of evidence that false accusations of rape are  .'
p5366
aS'Obama-era policies did not malign men.'
p5367
aS'What they did was make it easier for victims to come forward.'
p5368
aS'A 2011 "Dear Colleague" letter from the Obama administration advised universities to change the standard for how to determine guilt from proof that was "beyond a reasonable doubt" to a "preponderance of evidence" \xe2\x80\x94 or, more colloquially, more likely than not.'
p5369
aS'Before 2011, most colleges had already voluntarily made these changes.'
p5370
aS'There are several good reasons for that.'
p5371
aS'The "beyond a reasonable doubt" evidentiary standard usually applies to criminal charges \xe2\x80\x94 and college tribunals are not criminal courts.'
p5372
aS'Colleges can\xe2\x80\x99t determine whether or not an assailant will go to prison.'
p5373
aS'But they are required to keep students safe and promote equal access to education under Title IX, the civil rights law that secures nondiscrimination on the basis of sex or gender in federally funded educational programs.'
p5374
aS'Sexual assault complaints are essentially civil rights disputes, and a preponderance of evidence standard is what is   in civil rights cases.'
p5375
aS'The preponderance of evidence standard is also survivor-centered.'
p5376
aS'When judging whether someone has been raped, it\xe2\x80\x99s almost impossible to assert that a sex act constituted violence "beyond a reasonable doubt".'
p5377
aS'Many survivors struggle to produce what campus hearing boards would consider evidence, especially when it comes to acquaintance- or date-based   in which alcohol made it impossible for someone to physically resist.'
p5378
aS'Sexual assaults also commonly occur away from third-party witnesses, limiting the potential for corroborating testimonies.'
p5379
aS'Finally, trauma can make survivors seem   to campus administrators who are untrained.'
p5380
aS'The difficulty in providing hard evidence has long presented a devastating barrier for victims\xe2\x80\x99 access to recourse and remedies, and it discouraged survivors from coming forward.'
p5381
aS'The Obama administration responded to survivors\xe2\x80\x99 needs by lowering the burden of proof necessary to gain access to institutional support.'
p5382
aS'That   are reporting their sexual assaults to their universities shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t lead us to the conclusion that more college students are being raped or that more students are lying \xe2\x80\x94 just that more feel comfortable coming forward.'
p5383
aS'Of course, being accused of sexual assault hurts.'
p5384
aS'And there are things that we can and should do to help accused students \xe2\x80\x94 namely, providing them with psychological counsel.'
p5385
aS'But accused men\xe2\x80\x99s pain does not excuse rape, and men shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be the ones defining it.'
p5386
aS'Most rapists, even those who have been criminally convicted,   as such.'
p5387
aS'More broadly, there is a   to define sexual assault according to their own standards, not according to campus guidelines.'
p5388
aS'The ramifications of sexual assault are severe.'
p5389

p5608

p5610
aS'Mr. Zuma\xe2\x80\x99s rampant corruption has bolstered this disillusionment.'

aS'More recently, according to media reports, leaked emails and the findings of the public protector, Mr. Zuma outsourced some aspects of governance to a family of expats from India that has established businesses with his son, Duduzane Zuma, and is profiting from government contracts while exerting political influence wherever it can.'

aS'In 2016 Mcebisi Jonas, then a deputy minister of finance, reported that he had been summoned to the Gupta family mansion and offered 600 million rand (about $43 million) if he accepted the position of finance minister.'

aS'They embrace him as a charismatic, conservative man with four wives who speaks their language at political rallies and makes inside ethnic jokes.'
p5624
aS'Another source of power for Mr. Zuma is South Africa\xe2\x80\x99s electoral system, which is not constituency-based, but proportion-based.'
p5625
aS'Voters do not directly elect their representatives; they vote for political parties.'
p5626

aS'All of them toe the line, since none want to jeopardize their livelihoods.'

aS'Then there is the Umkhonto We Sizwe Military Veterans Association, a ragtag army of ardent Zuma supporters in ill-fitting camouflage uniforms who purport to be veterans of the A.N.C.\xe2\x80\x99s guerrilla war against the apartheid regime (though members in their early 20s are too young to have fought in a war that ended more than 25 years ago).'
p5629

aS'Not all is lost, however.'

aS'Despite South Africa\xe2\x80\x99s perverted state, the independent judiciary has been a saving grace, and a robust media regularly exposes government corruption.'

aS'Additionally, opposition parties, previously weak and ineffectual, have a much louder voice since being joined in Parliament by the Economic Freedom Fighters, a more radical party that has gained a large following among unemployed black youths.'
p5635
aS'Despite all this, Mr. Zuma is unlikely to relinquish power.'
p5636
aS'Were he to step down, civil groups and the opposition would undoubtedly see to it that the   of corruption and money laundering leveled against Mr. Zuma in 2009 be reactivated.'
p5637
aS'The charges were dropped shortly before his election as president, but last year South Africa\xe2\x80\x99s High Court ordered that they be reinstated.'

p5641
aS'The opposition parties are demanding that Mr. Zuma step down now.'
p5642
aS'But it is unlikely that any party will secure an outright majority in 2019; instead, the opposition parties will gang up against the A.N.C. and form coalitions in some provinces.'

aS'Their answers teach me that when historians write about Hurricanes Harvey and Irma, the wind and rain are likely to be a comparatively small part of the story.'
p5763
aS'Instead, what "Harvey" or "Irma" comes to mean will be defined by decisions that lie ahead.'
p5764
aS'Damaged homes will have to be rebuilt with insurance and federal aid.'

p5767
aS'What about people who were homeless before the storm?'
p5768
aS'Will recovery work pay a living wage?'
p5769
aS'The answers to questions like these will determine the future of Texas and Florida, starting with the fundamental fact of who will be able to go home.'
p5770
aS'That certainly was the case in New Orleans.'
p5771
aS'Today, while the city\xe2\x80\x99s white population has largely recovered since 2005, approximately 100,000 fewer African-Americans live here than did before Katrina.'
p5772
aS'This stark racial disparity cannot be explained by the flood alone, which discriminated less than many people realize.'
p5773
aS'Rather, political power and policy decisions account for the dramatic change.'
p5774
aS'Some of those decisions were bold and public.'
p5775
aS'As protesters were tear-gassed and stun-gunned outside of City Hall, for example, the legislators voted to demolish 4,500 public housing apartments, nearly all home to African-Americans.'
p5776
aS'"Our residents deserve better, much better than what we offered before," said the City Council president, Arnie Fielkow, which may have been true.'
p5777
aS'But a housing official\xe2\x80\x99s claim that "Katrina has come in and washed it away" was certainly not.'
p5778
aS'The brick buildings still stood and could easily have been reopened.'
p5779
aS'Five years after the storm, fewer than half of the families who once called those places home had returned to New Orleans.'
p5780
aS'Other decisions were more opaque, though their effects were just as profound.'
p5781
aS'Take a detail buried within what stands as America\xe2\x80\x99s largest housing recovery program, which Louisiana called Road Home.'
p5782
aS'The government paid out grants to flooded homeowners according to the so-called fair market value of their houses, rather than the replacement value.'
p5783
aS'Because of historically racist practices of underdevelopment and discrimination, this seemingly race-neutral policy meant that for comparable damage, homeowners in white neighborhoods were paid more than homeowners in African-American neighborhoods.'
p5784
aS'African-American homeowners sued and forced changes in the program, but the resolution did not come until six years after the storm.'
p5785
aS'For many families, it was too late to matter.'
p5786
aS'In fact, few people got enough from Road Home to replace the homes they lost, but the racial disparity in resources available to rebuild was vast.'
p5787
aS'In the predominantly white, middle-class neighborhood of Lakeview, the average gap between the cost of repairs and the amount homeowners received in private insurance and Road Home funds was $44,000.'
p5788
aS'But in the mostly African-American, middle-class neighborhood of New Orleans East, the average gap was $69,000.'
p5789
aS'In this way, Katrina cost African-Americans more than it cost whites.'
p5790
aS'Some scholars argue that disasters replicate social inequality, but that\xe2\x80\x99s not it, exactly.'
p5791
aS'When cities flood, our actions often create and re-create inequality.'
p5792
aS'But the same is true even when there is no flood.'
p5793
aS'Even though inequality can sometimes seem like the natural order of things, acts of God, as some call them, are deeply embedded in the acts of women and men.'
p5794
aS'There have been calls not to "politicize" the recent storms.'
p5795
aS'We heard the same thing after Hurricane Katrina.'
p5796
aS'But rather than closing our eyes to the political decisions that shape our communities, we should open them wide.'
p5797
aS'A disaster without politics would be an event without a history, a catastrophe without a cause.'
p5798
aS'It would have nothing to teach us about how to rebuild this time, or how to prevent the disaster next time.'
p5799
aS'In the days after Hurricane Katrina, many people in positions of power asserted that New Orleans should not be rebuilt, as if abandoning this city would somehow solve the problems Katrina had posed.'
p5800
aS'Those barbs still sting here, especially as Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and other frighteningly similar events across the country have made clear what many New Orleanians always understood: that New Orleans\xe2\x80\x99s history is America\xe2\x80\x99s history, and that Katrina is America\xe2\x80\x99s possible future.'
p5801
aS'The metropolitan sprawl that made single-family homes affordable and vulnerable, the National Flood Insurance Program that has perversely subsidized construction in flood-prone areas, the infrastructure that is not up to the challenge of a warming world, the racist fear that rends our communities, the crushing inequality and the sometimes reckless, sometimes revolutionary, hope that the future might be better than the past \xe2\x80\x94 none of these is unique to Louisiana or the Gulf Coast.'
p5802
aS'They define the United States in the 21st century.'
p5803
aS'The "we" who get to decide these things is rarely the "we" who are most affected by the decisions.'
p5804
aS'The suffering that our collective actions impose upon some people, followed often by the blinding insistence that their vulnerability was somehow fair, or natural, or inevitable, is not the cause or consequence of some external disaster.'
p5805
aS'It is the disaster itself.'
p5806
aS'Republicans \xe2\x80\x94 like President Trump, for instance \xe2\x80\x94 love to puff up their chests, grasp their lapels and declaim in foghorn voices about their devotion to law and order.'
p5807
aS'And so, on Tuesday, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, piously declared that the Justice Department should consider whether James Comey had broken the law before and after Trump fired him as director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.'
p5808
aS'"I think if there\xe2\x80\x99s ever a moment where we feel someone\xe2\x80\x99s broken the law, particularly if they\xe2\x80\x99re the head of the F.B.I., I think that\xe2\x80\x99s something that certainly should be looked at," she said.'
p5809
aS'She was referring to Comey\xe2\x80\x99s exoneration of Hillary Clinton in the email caper, and his admission that he had leaked his own private memo describing conversations with Trump.'
p5810
aS'It couldn\xe2\x80\x99t get clearer than that, right?'
p5811
aS'Not so fast.'
p5812
aS'On a Friday night in August, when Hurricane Harvey was barreling into Texas, Trump  , the former Maricopa County, Ariz.'
p5813
aS'a, sheriff who had blatantly violated a court order to stop detaining people because he thought they looked Mexican.'
p5814
aS'It didn\xe2\x80\x99t bother President Law and Order that he undercut the courts\xe2\x80\x99 only power to enforce their orders.'
p5815
aS'His praise of Arpaio as being "very strong" on lawbreaking by border crossers did not mention that the former sheriff fed his victims rotten food in outdoor detention camps where temperatures soared and some prisoners even died.'
p5816
aS'Or that he failed to investigate about  .'
p5817
aS'Under the Trump formula, Comey should be investigated by the Justice Department \xe2\x80\x94 but Michael Flynn, who had to resign in disgrace as national security adviser, should get a pass for lying to Vice President Mike Pence about his meetings with the Russian ambassador.'
p5818
aS'On Wednesday, we learned that Democrats in Congress are asking questions about another memory slip by Flynn \xe2\x80\x94 failing to disclose a trip he took in 2015 to try to broker a Saudi-Russian deal on nuclear power plants \xe2\x80\x94 and that he may have lobbied inside the White House for that deal.'
p5819
aS'Because in Trump World, Flynn is a "good" guy, while Comey is not \xe2\x80\x94 and, that\xe2\x80\x99s what this is all about.'
p5820
aS'It\xe2\x80\x99s a dark, twisted version of the "naughty and nice lists," as reimagined by someone whose heart is at least two sizes too small.'
p5821
aS'Thus, Hillary Clinton should be "locked up" for her witless handling of her email server years ago, but Donald Trump Jr. should not be called to account for meeting last year with Kremlin agents to get "dirt" on Clinton, or later telling tall tales about the meeting.'
p5822
aS'The Trump Naughty list covers all undocumented immigrants (including those brought here as children) from Latin America and refugees of most kinds, especially Muslims.'
p5823
aS'Then there are the Americans who visited a website that organized protests against Trump after the election.'
p5824
aS'The Justice Department wants their internet addresses \xe2\x80\x94 1.3 million of them \xe2\x80\x94 and a District of Columbia judge in Washington   with the ridiculous argument that he would review the information to protect "innocent" people.'
p5825
aS'That would be all 1.3 million.'
p5826
aS'So their constitutional rights should be trampled in Trumpland.'
p5827
aS'Yet we should respect those of the armed thugs who gathered in Charlottesville, Va., to defend symbols of racism in American history.'
p5828
aS'The law-and-order president wants to target journalists who cover his administration in ways he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t like, subjecting them to leak investigations and, he has darkly hinted, perhaps a curtailment of their First Amendment rights.'
p5829
aS'The global Naughty List includes Kim Jong-un of North Korea, who should be there.'

aS'The Razak visit, he said, was about "very large trade deals" and Malaysia\xe2\x80\x99s status as a "massive investor" in this country.'
p5834
aS'Razak, no doubt by sheer coincidence, stayed at the Trump hotel in Washington.'
p5835
aS'Really, the Nice List is not so mysterious.'
p5836
aS'To get on it, be a member of Trump\xe2\x80\x99s family, support him with unquestioning and sycophantic loyalty, rule your country through blood and fear \xe2\x80\x94 or just throw money his way.'
p5837
aS'In over 45 years of  working in global affairs, I\xe2\x80\x99ve observed a simple truth: America\xe2\x80\x99s ability to lead the world depends not just on the example of our power, but on the power of our example.'
p5838
aS'American democracy is rooted in the belief that every man, woman and child has equal rights to freedom and dignity.'
p5839
aS'While the United States is far from perfect, we have never given up the struggle to grow closer to the ideals in our founding documents.'
p5840
aS'The constant American endeavor to live by our values is a great strength that has drawn generations of strivers and dreamers to the United States, enriching our population.'
p5841
aS'Around the world, other nations follow our lead because they know that America does not simply protect its own interests, but tries to advance the aspirations of all.'
p5842
aS'This has stood as the foundation of American foreign policy throughout my political career \xe2\x80\x94 until recently.'
p5843
aS'Around the world, including in the United States, we are seeing the resurgence of a worldview that is closed off and clannish.'
p5844
aS'President Trump keeps longstanding allies such as Germany at arm\xe2\x80\x99s length, while expressing admiration for autocrats like Vladimir V. Putin who thwart democratic institutions.'
p5845
aS'Rather than building from a narrative of freedom and democracy that inspires nations to rally together, this White House casts global affairs as a zero-sum competition \xe2\x80\x94 for the United States to succeed, others must lose.'
p5846
aS'Among the many problems that plague the Trump administration\xe2\x80\x99s foreign policy, this line of thinking is perhaps the most disturbing.'
p5847
aS'During   in July, Mr. Trump said, "The fundamental question of our time is whether the West has the will to survive".'
p5848
aS'This statement divides the world into "us" and "them".'
p5849
aS'No American political figure has so narrowly defined our interests since the period between the world wars.'
p5850
aS'Mr. Trump\xe2\x80\x99s shameful   of the white nationalists and neo-Nazis who unleashed hatred and violence in  , further abnegated America\xe2\x80\x99s moral leadership.'
p5851
aS'Not since the Jim Crow era has an American president so misunderstood and misrepresented our values.'
p5852
aS'Most recently, the Trump administration\xe2\x80\x99s order to rescind Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals \xe2\x80\x94 punishing young people brought to this country by their parents, many of whom know no home but the United States \xe2\x80\x94 betrays an unnecessary cruelty that further undermines America\xe2\x80\x99s standing in the world.'
p5853
aS'When   said that it was important to "understand the difference between policy and values," he wrote off the very thing that makes the United States exceptional.'
p5854
aS'And at a time when democratic values are under siege around the globe \xe2\x80\x94 from populist attacks that undermine confidence in democratic institutions to leaders who try to bolster their power by closing the space for civil society and rolling back citizens\xe2\x80\x99 rights \xe2\x80\x94 the world cannot afford to have America cede the field to illiberalism and intolerance.'
p5855
aS'Placing American democratic values back at the center of our foreign policy does not mean we should impose our principles abroad or refuse to talk with nations whose policies run counter to them.'
p5856
aS'There will always be times when keeping Americans safe requires working with those whom we find distasteful.'
p5857
aS'But even when we must make those hard choices, we can never forget who we are and the future we seek.'
p5858
aS'Reclaiming our values starts with standing up for them at home \xe2\x80\x94 inclusivity, tolerance, diversity, respect for the rule of law, freedom of speech, freedom of the press.'
p5859
aS'If these are the democratic principles we wish to see around the world, America must be the first to model them.'
p5860
aS'These are also the values that tie us to our closest allies \xe2\x80\x94 the friends we depend on to address major global challenges.'
p5861
aS'They must believe that the United States will continue to support them and to stand up for democracy.'
p5862
aS'Leading with our values also means that we speak out when nations violate their citizens\xe2\x80\x99 rights.'
p5863
aS'If leaders repress their own people, we must make clear that it constrains our ability to cooperate with them.'
p5864
aS'We can meet our security imperatives without giving a green light to dictators who abuse universal human rights.'
p5865
aS'Finally, a foreign policy built on our values must stand firm against foreign powers that celebrate a perceived withdrawal of American leadership as an opportunity to increase their influence.'
p5866
aS'Without the United States standing as a bulwark for global democracy, illiberal powers like Russia will take increasingly aggressive steps to disrupt the international order, bully their neighbors and return to a more divided world.'
p5867
aS'From the Marshall Plan after World War II to our alliances in East Asia, both Republican and Democratic officials have long embraced a vision of American leadership that fosters a more secure, inclusive and generous planet.'
p5868
aS'That ideal made the world safer and more prosperous \xe2\x80\x94 for Americans and everyone else.'
p5869
aS'The international community still needs a strong, democratic America leading the way.'
p5870
aS'And the good news is that the United States remains better positioned than any other country to shape the direction of the 21st century.'
p5871
aS'But to succeed, we cannot abandon the tenets that we fought so hard to defend over the past seven decades \xe2\x80\x94 ideals that magnified American leadership and produced the greatest increase in global prosperity in history.'
p5872
aS'You cannot define Americans by what they look like, where they come from, whom they love or how they worship.'
p5873
aS'Only our democratic values define us.'
p5874
aS'And if we lose sight of this in our conduct at home or abroad, we jeopardize the respect that has made the United States the greatest nation on earth.'
p5875
aS'The Federal Reserve arguably has more influence on the daily lives of Americans than any other government agency.'
p5876
aS'In the coming year President Trump has a chance to appoint or replace five of the central bank\xe2\x80\x99s seven governors, including the vice chairman, Stanley Fischer, and possibly the chairwoman, Janet Yellen.'
p5877
aS'Few presidents have had so many seats to fill this quickly, and it\xe2\x80\x99s time to pay attention to how Mr. Trump will use the opportunity.'
p5878
aS'The heavy hitters vying for seats are talking \xe2\x80\x94 often vaguely \xe2\x80\x94 about reforming the Fed, which has been praised for preventing a depression after the financial crisis of 2008, but questioned for failing to anticipate the crisis itself.'
p5879
aS'The Fed missed the crisis in part because it has a dual mandate to keep unemployment and consumer price inflation low \xe2\x80\x94 and both were low before 2008.'
p5880
aS'Real reform would add a third mandate: maintaining financial stability, and in particular stabilizing prices for assets like houses and stocks, which are not counted as "consumer prices" but now have a bigger influence on the economy.'
p5881
aS'Consumer price inflation has largely disappeared, in part because central bankers have been fighting it effectively since the 1970s, and in part because heightened global competition began restraining prices for consumer goods from TVs to toys.'
p5882
aS'Meanwhile, asset prices are getting pushed in the opposite direction.'
p5883
aS'To ease the Great Recession after 2008, central banks adopted zero to negative interest rates and provided huge amounts of cash, effectively giving investors free money.'
p5884
aS'In a world with few barriers to the flow of capital across borders, this is spurring buying sprees, and thus bidding up prices for stocks, bonds and real estate in markets from New York to Shanghai.'
p5885
aS'Today, global financial assets (including just stocks and bonds) are worth over $250 trillion and amount to about 330 percent of global gross domestic product, up from $12 trillion and just 110 percent in 1980.'
p5886
aS'Traditionally, economists have looked for trouble in the economy to cause trouble in the markets.'
p5887
aS'But the ocean of money in financial markets is now so large, it\xe2\x80\x99s possible that ripples on its surface could trigger the next big downturn.'
p5888
aS'In the postwar era, finance has grown enormously as a share of the global economy, often feeding debt-fueled bubbles.'
p5889
aS'In 2015, the economist Alan M. Taylor and his colleagues   going back 140 years for 17 leading economies.'
p5890
aS'Before World War II, there were 78 recessions \xe2\x80\x94 including only 19 that followed a bubble in stocks or housing or both.'
p5891
aS'After the war, there were 88 recessions, a vast majority of which, 62, followed a stock or housing bubble or both.'
p5892
aS'Since 1990, every major economic shock has been preceded by a collapse in prices for houses, stocks or both, including Japan\xe2\x80\x99s crash in 1990, the Asian crisis of the late 1990s, the dot-com crash of 2000-01, and the global financial crisis of 2008.'
p5893
aS'The Fed has changed with the world before.'
p5894
aS'After the Great Depression, it focused on fighting unemployment.'
p5895
aS'Amid crippling consumer price inflation in the 1970s, it shifted its focus to fighting this scourge.'
p5896
aS'Now, amid looming market bubbles from China to Norway, central bankers are tentatively starting to recognize that they can\xe2\x80\x99t ignore asset price inflation.'
p5897
aS'At the Federal Open Market Committee, its key policy-making body, financial stability rarely came up before 2012 but has come up at 27 of 39 meetings since.'
p5898
aS'Of course, even market insiders can\xe2\x80\x99t spot when asset prices are ready to crash, so skeptics say the Fed can\xe2\x80\x99t be expected to either.'
p5899
aS'Better to let bubbles pop and "mop up" after.'
p5900
aS'However, the painfully slow recovery from 2008 shows how ineffective mess-mopping can be: Losses after the crash tend to be much bigger than gains on the way up.'
p5901
aS'The Fed need not try to predict the market\xe2\x80\x99s peak; it needs only to identify signals of crises, so that it can act early to forestall them, controlling asset price inflation by raising rates or reducing cash infusions into the economy.'
p5902
aS'Thanks to post-mortem research done since 2008, we know much more about these signals.'
p5903
aS'The key is to be on alert when markets are rising much faster than the underlying economy.'
p5904
aS'Normally, for example, home prices rise around 5 percent a year; the International Monetary Fund has   that rate more than doubles in pre-crisis periods.'
p5905
aS'At least equally telling is the pace of increase in debt.'
p5906
aS'When asset prices collapse, the owners suffer instant pain.'
p5907
aS'But when debt used to buy those assets collapses, the resulting defaults ripple through banks and become a drag on the economy.'
p5908
aS'The longest and deepest recessions tend to follow real estate busts, because homes are almost always purchased on credit, and during booms, so many buyers are tempted to borrow excessively for that dream house.'
p5909
aS'Nonetheless most economists \xe2\x80\x94 even conservative deficit hawks who worry about the Fed "blowing bubbles" \xe2\x80\x94 still look mainly for economic threats to the financial markets, rather than the threat that overgrown markets pose.'
p5910
aS'They thus don\xe2\x80\x99t recognize fully that the world has changed, and the tail now wags the dog.'
p5911
aS'Many mainstream economists still argue that the economy can\xe2\x80\x99t be overheating if consumer price inflation is quiet, and they want to keep rates lower for longer, hoping that easy money will stoke growth in the economy, and jobs, for the poor and the working class.'
p5912
aS'However, since 2008, easy money has produced an unusually weak economic recovery alongside an unusually long and strong run-up in prices for stocks, bonds and housing.'
p5913
aS'The rich own the fattest share of these assets, so wealth inequality is increasing.'
p5914
aS'In addition, easy money is fueling monopoly power by helping entrenched companies borrow.'
p5915
aS'Liberals who question the value of promoting monopolies and the superrich might also question their fondness for easy money.'
p5916
aS'Instead, to stabilize financial markets, most favor upholding tough post-2008 regulations \xe2\x80\x94 but regulation alone can\xe2\x80\x99t contain the ocean of money in financial assets.'
p5917
aS'From Australia to Canada to Sweden, central banks are keeping rates low because consumer price inflation is weak, thus fueling housing bubbles.'
p5918
aS'Regulatory attempts to contain those bubbles are failing.'
p5919
aS'Central bankers are starting to recognize that when loose monetary policy is driving up asset prices to potentially unstable levels, it sows the seeds of a recession and hurts everyone.'
p5920
aS'But only a minority are prepared to lean against the wind now.'
p5921
aS'Asset prices from stocks to real estate have never been this expensive simultaneously.'
p5922
aS'In general, government agencies, including the Fed, change their ways only after crises.'
p5923
aS'The big threat is that the Fed will fully commit to preserving financial stability only after instability in the markets has triggered the next crisis.'
p5924
aS'Mr. Trump should be looking for governors who are willing to commit now.'
p5925
aS'Like solar eclipses and bipartisan legislation, moments of near-universal consensus are extremely rare.'

aS'One such event took place on Wednesday, when a start-up named Bodega stated its intention to put its namesake \xe2\x80\x94 real-life, neighborhood corner stores \xe2\x80\x94 out of business by replacing them with unmanned pantries.'

aS'My first bodega in New York was on Eighth Avenue, where I was known as "Houston" by the staff because, well, I\xe2\x80\x99m from Houston.'

aS'Of course, it was pronounced like the nearby street in Lower Manhattan rather than the city in Texas.'
p5952
aS'At first, it irritated me.'

aS'It has been a while since an appellate-court nomination generated as much noise as last week\xe2\x80\x99s hearing for Amy Coney Barrett, a law professor at Notre Dame and a nominee to the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals.'
p5959
aS'During the hearing, Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California, pressed Ms. Barrett, who is a devout Catholic, on the relationship between faith and judicial duty, which the professor had once addressed in a law review  .'
p5960
aS'In that piece, she argued that there may be occasions, such as in death penalty cases, where a judge might have to recuse herself because of a conflict between her religious beliefs and her responsibilities as a judge.'
p5961
aS'The law is totally different.'
p5962
aS'Senator Feinstein asked Ms. Barrett about her views, and then made the following statement: "Whatever a religion is, it has its own dogma. And I think in your case, professor, when you read your speeches, the conclusion one draws is that the dogma lives loudly within you, and that\xe2\x80\x99s of concern when you come to big issues that large numbers of people have fought for for years in this country".'
p5963
aS'Other Democratic senators also   similar ideas in their own questions and statements.'
p5964
aS'The reaction was swift and ruthless.'
p5965
aS'Noah Feldman of Harvard Law School   because the "thrust of Feinstein\xe2\x80\x99s questioning was that, as a believing Catholic, Barrett couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be trusted to apply the Constitution and laws objectively".'
p5966
aS'Other commentators, such as Christopher L. Eisgruber, the president of Princeton,   that Ms. Feinstein\xe2\x80\x99s comments amounted to a religious test for office.'
p5967
aS'The reaction to Ms. Feinstein\xe2\x80\x99s comments is understandable, but overblown.'
p5968
aS'She is surely guilty of poor word choice: As Mr. Feldman noted, the term "dogma" has an ugly historical context, often used by 19th-century Protestants to express anti-Catholic bigotry.'
p5969
aS'But that is an objection more to style than to substance.'
p5970
aS'And on the substance, asking a nominee about her strong faith, and whether she can put her religious views aside when deciding cases that implicate those views, is nowhere close to imposing a religious test for office.'
p5971
aS'Senator Feinstein was not suggesting that Catholics shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be judges.'
p5972
aS'She was asking whether someone of deep faith and who had previously openly (and in our opinion eloquently) written about the relationship between judging and faith could cast aside her deeply held views when judging.'
p5973
aS'Had Ms. Barrett said that her faith would in fact deeply influence her judging, would the question have been deemed so wrong?'
p5974
aS'We think not.'
p5975
aS'Likewise, if senators had asked Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg during her confirmation hearing if her long history litigating claims of gender discrimination would influence her judging, or if they had asked Chief Justice John Roberts whether his time working in the Bush administration would affect his decision making, no one would have blinked.'
p5976
aS'Judges regularly decide difficult legal issues in which the law at issue is unclear.'
p5977
aS'In those open spaces, a judge\xe2\x80\x99s personal values and life experiences will inevitably play a role in the outcome of the case.'
p5978
aS'Given that Ms. Barrett had previously explored the relationship between her deeply held religious views and judging, Ms. Feinstein acted well within the bounds of fair questioning to probe deeply on this question.'
p5979
aS'Moreover, the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment, which forbids government from making any law "respecting an establishment of religion," plays a special role in this context.'
p5980
aS'The potential impact of religious belief on government officials, including judges, is a matter of special concern in a nation dedicated to the separation of church and state, especially on such fundamental issues as abortion, gay rights and capital punishment.'
p5981
aS'As Ms. Barrett thoughtfully observed in her 1998 law review article on this subject, "Catholic judges must answer some complex moral and legal questions in deciding whether to sit in death penalty cases".'
p5982
aS'Judges, she wrote, "cannot \xe2\x80\x94 nor should they try to \xe2\x80\x94 align our legal system with the church\xe2\x80\x99s moral teaching whenever the two diverge".'
p5983
aS'It was this issue that Senator Feinstein was asking about, and in light of the fact that Ms. Barrett has both written and spoken on this dilemma, it was perfectly appropriate for members of the Senate Judiciary Committee to explore this issue with her.'
p5984
aS'In no way was this a "religious test" for office or an expression of anti-Catholic bigotry.'
p5985
aS'It was a sensible effort to explore how Ms. Barrett would handle the "complex moral and legal question" that she herself had sensibly brought to the fore.'
p5986
aS'Back when identity theft was mainly credit card fraud and a 100,000-record leak was a big deal \xe2\x80\x94 the good old days, around 2004 \xe2\x80\x94 my hacker friends and I would sit around and brainstorm ways to slow down what some were calling the fastest-growing crime of the century.'

aS'One method came up again and again: Someone should steal the entire database of Social Security numbers and publish it online.'

aS'(No one tried \xe2\x80\x94 that would be a crime!'

aS') Why do something so crazy?'
p5990
aS'Once and for all, it would eliminate the fantasy that a Social Security number is both a unique identifier and a secret to be used as an authenticator.'
p5991
aS'Consumers are asked for their Social Security number perhaps dozens of times each year: by banks, by utility companies, by their health care providers, by government agencies, even by websites.'
p5992
aS'Every time the number is given, the odds go up that it will fall into the wrong hands.'
p5993
aS'Still, America\xe2\x80\x99s identification system relies on the fantasy that these nine digits are a secret.'
p5994
aS'Publication of the full Social Security number list would shatter that fantasy and force the banking industry to invent new and genuinely effective ways to protect consumers from identity thieves.'
p5995
aS'It seems that has finally occurred.'
p5996
aS'The Equifax credit-reporting agency is being terribly, dangerously vague about its stunning loss of  .'
p5997
aS'The data belong to roughly three-quarters of Americans with a credit report.'
p5998
aS'Might as well be everyone.'
p5999
aS'Whatever the company finally admits to, this much is certain: Social Security numbers are no longer a secret.'
p6000
aS'These numbers were created for a single purpose: to track worker contributions to a national retirement fund.'
p6001
aS'Until the 1970s, the cards even arrived printed with the warning "Not for identification".'
p6002
aS'It\xe2\x80\x99s time we heeded that warning and stopped using the number for applications of any kind.'
p6003
aS'For loans, for jobs, for cellphones.'
p6004
aS'It\xe2\x80\x99s going to be very expensive, but the jig is up.'
p6005
aS'Identity theft is an unfair shifting of costs.'
p6006
aS'It has always been cheaper to avoid investment in security upgrades and instead push the real costs of this system onto victims, who spend hours cleaning up the messes left behind.'
p6007
aS'They sometimes even pay a monthly fee for protection from a system they never asked to be a part of in the first place.'
p6008
aS'This fragile authentication arrangement based on Social Security numbers persists so that retailers and banks can offer easy credit.'
p6009
aS'Walk in with a number and a name, walk out with a new TV and a credit card.'
p6010
aS'As long as a credit score attached to the Social Security number listed on the application is high enough, many creditors are more than happy to make that snap decision and take the risk.'
p6011
aS'Sometimes the name doesn\xe2\x80\x99t even have to match.'
p6012
aS'That\xe2\x80\x99s why the former Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan   that "children, dogs, cats and moose are getting credit cards".'
p6013
aS'And if a few consumers end up with ruined credit or paperwork headaches or, in extreme cases, losing their jobs or getting arrested \xe2\x80\x94 well, that\xe2\x80\x99s just the cost of doing business.'
p6014
aS'Some security tools have made their way into the system.'
p6015
aS'Companies use big data, examining public records or other background sources to see whether the address on an application matches, if the name and age make sense, and even if a particular Social Security number is making the rounds among thieves.'
p6016
aS'Despite these tools, the overall incidence of identity theft hit a record high last year,  .'
p6017
aS'New-account fraud, perhaps the worst kind, spiked 20 percent last year, the firm said.'
p6018
aS'It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have to be this way.'
p6019
aS'You might recall that until recently, United States-based credit cards were protected only by 1960s-era magnetic stripe technology.'
p6020
aS'We were at least a decade behind Europeans, who enjoyed added security from chip-enabled cards.'
p6021
aS'Retailers and banks delayed and delayed, playing a game of chicken over who would pay for the costs.'
p6022
aS'Then the 2013   took place, and now we insert instead of swipe.'
p6023
aS'Results have been mixed, but at least one kind of credit card fraud, card cloning, has significantly decreased.'
p6024
aS'The Equifax hack could be another Target moment.'
p6025
aS'It should spur industry into action and upgrade.'
p6026
aS'No single technology is going to replace Social Security numbers as an identifier and a secret, and that\xe2\x80\x99s a good thing.'
p6027
aS'There is security in diversity.'
p6028
aS'Two-factor authentication, available from many banks, should be required for new credit.'
p6029
aS'The credit bureaus themselves could develop new unique IDs for us, to be used only for credit purposes.'
p6030
aS'Biometrics can be used by employers and government agencies that require high levels of security.'
p6031
aS'Social Security numbers were never designed to be a security tool, and their usefulness for that purpose has run its course.'
p6032
aS'Just publish the whole list and be done with it.'
p6033
aS'Then get on to the business of keeping our secrets a secret.'
p6034
aS'Looking across the globe, it might appear at times that violence, chaos and fear are getting the upper hand over order, democracy and reason.'
p6035
aS'The world has always been a messy place, of course, and it may be that the internet and social media give the worst of times more prominence than the best.'
p6036
aS'But there are real reasons for anxiety.'
p6037
aS'Traditional democratic ideals and institutions are under attack.'
p6038
aS'Some leaders in Eastern Europe espouse "illiberal" democracy, which treads on traditional human rights.'
p6039
aS'Authoritarian leaders from Russia to Venezuela grow stronger; Kim Jong-un of North Korea defies the world in his pursuit of a doomsday weapon.'
p6040
aS'And the United States under Donald Trump becomes more bitterly divided and unpredictable.'
p6041
aS'Historically, however, there has also been pushback, a rejection of oppression and despotism.'
p6042
aS'It brought about the end of apartheid, the fall of the Berlin Wall, the Black Lives Matter movement in the United States, the acceptance of more than a million refugees in Germany.'
p6043
aS'Countries rarely embrace democracy as their first choice; they have often tried monarchies, oligarchies or other forms of coercive government first.'
p6044
aS'They come to democracy because, for all its messiness and inefficiency, it is the way to give people a voice in how they\xe2\x80\x99re governed, and to allow them to change leaders peacefully.'
p6045
aS'But it can never be taken for granted.'
p6046
aS'It is constantly confronting challenges and threats and adapting to changing times.'
p6047
aS'Those challenges will be discussed at the five-day   this week in Athens, Greece.'

aS'Last week I wrote   praising Betsy DeVos for announcing that the Department of Education would   the Obama administration\xe2\x80\x99s 2011 "guidance" on campus sexual assault.'
p6051
aS'The new guidelines, often interpreted with Procrustean severity by nervous campus administrators, had all but eliminated elementary aspects of due process for the accused.'
p6052
aS'The results, in far too many cases, were bad verdicts, ruined reputations and permanently damaged lives.'
p6053
aS'It\xe2\x80\x99s in our moral and constitutional DNA that we take extraordinary pains to safeguard the rights of the accused, even when it means letting the guilty go free.'
p6054
aS'But we also believe in justice, and the fact is that sexual assault is a brutal reality of modern campus life, abetted in too many instances by a culture of binge drinking.'
p6055
aS'How best to change this without compounding one injustice with another, or intruding too far into private life, or violating fundamental rights is a matter of debate.'
p6056
aS'That it has to change isn\xe2\x80\x99t, or shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be.'
p6057
aS'After the column\xe2\x80\x99s publication, a young friend wrote me a personal note to share her experience of being raped in college.'
p6058
aS'Her letter is so detailed, devastating, honest and thoughtful that I thought the best thing to do was give her the full stage of an Op-Ed column in The Times.'
p6059
aS'Here is her letter.'
p6060
aS'She asked that her name be withheld to protect her privacy.'
p6061
aS'Dear Bret, I wanted to write you about your Betsy DeVos column.'
p6062
aS'I found it wanting in the way I find many pieces on this subject wanting.'
p6063
aS'I hope you\xe2\x80\x99ll hear me out.'
p6064
aS'I agree with you that the current system is bad, that the guidance issued by the Obama administration should be reformed, that due process should be safeguarded.'
p6065
aS'I do.'
p6066
aS'In fact, I think the backlash from the bad guidance issued will make things only harder for victims of assault.'
p6067
aS'And so, that being said, may I suggest a follow-up column?'
p6068
aS'I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen many pieces by sensible people on the violated rights of accused rapists.'
p6069
aS'I have seen zero pieces from the center-right on the rights of sexual-assault victims.'
p6070
aS'I have seen zero pieces that take the problem of sexual assault seriously.'
p6071
aS'The best we get is a glancing line, and then a question about statistics.'
p6072
aS'But if one took as a given that there was some kind of sexual assault crisis going on at the campuses \xe2\x80\x94 even one that resulted in more bad accusations along with real accusations \xe2\x80\x94 well, then, can you tell me what should be done about it that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t violate due process and that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t make it harder for the victims to come forward and get a conviction?'
p6073
aS'If you want to get some perspective on the issue, perhaps you could do more than look at some studies.'
p6074
aS'At least give the victims the same careful attention you give the accused.'
p6075
aS'I can be your first interview.'
p6076
aS'In college, I once blacked out drunk at a party and someone offered to walk me home.'
p6077
aS'I don\xe2\x80\x99t remember what happened after that, but when I woke up my clothes were on inside out.'
p6078
aS'I started screaming.'
p6079
aS'I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know what had happened, but I did know that some part of me had died forever, and that I had been violated.'
p6080
aS'It had happened in my empty apartment, late at night, and no one had seen it but us.'
p6081
aS'Both of us had been drinking.'
p6082
aS'I was clearly incapacitated, blacked out, walked home shoeless, had bruises from falling over.'
p6083
aS'How does one prove I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t passed out at the time of the event itself?'
p6084
aS'We were the only ones there.'
p6085
aS'I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t remember enough from the night to even defend myself.'
p6086
aS'What if I had said O.K.?'
p6087
aS'I didn\xe2\x80\x99t learn till later that incapacitated people can\xe2\x80\x99t consent.'
p6088
aS'At the time I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know enough about rape laws to know that it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t my fault.'
p6089
aS'And I didn\xe2\x80\x99t think that anyone would believe me even if I had been unconscious when it happened.'
p6090
aS'I had no proof.'
p6091
aS'Not more than 50 percent, anyway.'
p6092
aS'Another girl at my college had reported a rape and had been forced to sit through peer mediation with her rapist.'
p6093
aS'I didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to go through that.'
p6094
aS'I was a strong, tough girl.'
p6095
aS'The prospect of losing a case seemed worse to me than the prospect of sucking it up and moving on.'
p6096
aS'So I survived.'
p6097
aS'I would wake up sweating from nightmares.'
p6098
aS'I would call up my mom in the middle of the night hysterical and she would stay on the phone with me until I fell back asleep.'
p6099
aS'I lost about 30 pounds.'
p6100
aS'I would gaze into oncoming traffic as I walked to work and think about jumping in.'
p6101
aS'It took about a year, but I finally got myself to a place where I could talk about what happened to someone who knew better about this sort of thing.'
p6102
aS'And then I wanted justice.'
p6103
aS'But by that time, there was no "preponderance" of evidence to debate.'
p6104
aS'There was no evidence at all.'
p6105
aS'If the sexual assault crisis on college campuses shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t, and can\xe2\x80\x99t, be addressed by the Department of Education or by changing Title IX, then who can change it and how?'
p6106
aS'I suspect many of the solutions to this crisis are cultural and moral rather than legal, and perhaps there isn\xe2\x80\x99t a clear policy solution.'
p6107
aS'You\xe2\x80\x99re a columnist, and you care about the culture, and it\xe2\x80\x99s well within your purview to examine the moral questions of our time.'
p6108
aS'It seems to me that conservatives and mainstream liberals have abdicated concern about sexual assault to the far left.'
p6109
aS'It\xe2\x80\x99s an astounding moral blind spot, and frankly it breaks my heart.'
p6110
aS'In an era where I had to choose between voting for a man who had bragged about sexual assault or a woman who had enabled a husband accused of it, in an era where we can\xe2\x80\x99t even convict Bill Cosby of sexual assault, in an era when a Brock Turner-type gets nothing but a slap on the wrist, the general public still has to be convinced that rape and sexual harassment are  problems.'
p6111
aS'It\xe2\x80\x99s easy to believe there\xe2\x80\x99s an epidemic of  accusations, but not that there\xe2\x80\x99s too much sexual assault.'
p6112
aS'It\xe2\x80\x99s a cognitive dissonance I can\xe2\x80\x99t explain with any charity.'
p6113
aS'I know in my bones that Brock Turner got convicted only because he assaulted that girl in public.'
p6114
aS'If it had happened like it had happened to me, in an empty house, with no one to see \xe2\x80\x94 if there had been no photos \xe2\x80\x94 that boy would have walked away with nothing at all.'
p6115
aS'He would have been as unscathed as the one who raped me.'
p6116
aS'I have helped too many of my friends recover from similar stories to question whether or not this country has a sexual-assault problem.'
p6117
aS'Campuses are a funny focal point, of course.'
p6118
aS'I am sure it is worse for poor women, uneducated women, those outside the bubble of privileged young people at elite institutions.'
p6119
aS'But it still happens on campuses.'
p6120
aS'I hate having to use my own life as an example.'
p6121
aS'But honestly, so many of the conservative men in my life won\xe2\x80\x99t listen to me on this argument until I tell them my story.'
p6122
aS'So here I am.'
p6123
aS'I was raped.'
p6124

aS'I had been drinking.'
p6126
aS'I had no witnesses.'

p6147
aS'Some towns and cities were in states or regions that had passed religious liberty acts, which allowed for employers and service providers refuse to serve, employ or rent to people based on the sexual identity (or people they might   were L.G.B.T.Q.I.A., for that matter) so long as that identity was against the employer, service provider or landlord\xe2\x80\x99s religion.'

aS'I thought of all my brothers and sisters and siblings who, throughout history, had come in and out of the door of the Stonewall Inn, many of whom were never able to come out and lead full lives, let alone marry the person they love.'
p6168
aS'That night at the benefit, which was organized by a lesbian-run political action committee, I met some my heroes: Marsha Warfield, Kate Clinton, Rosie O\xe2\x80\x99Donnell and Alison Bechdel, who told me the first gay bar she ever went to was in my hometown.'
p6169
aS'I had heard that Edie Windsor was there and at the after party, I spotted her from across the room.'
p6170
aS'In that moment, I felt that same connection I had felt earlier in the day at Stonewall.'
p6171
aS'Edie was more than a hero for me and young L.G.B.T.Q.I.A. people across the country.'
p6172
aS'She was a matriarch in our ancestry; a strong branch in our family tree.'
p6173
aS'I immediately noticed how tiny she was.'
p6174
aS'She reminded me of my own grandmother, who had passed away at 88 years old, a tough woman who had been pushed down \xe2\x80\x94 she literally lost inches \xe2\x80\x94 on account of the burdens she carried.'
p6175
aS'I realized how much weight Edie carried in   life, through the 42 years she spent engaged but not legally married to her love, Thea Spyer, who died of multiple sclerosis in 2009.'
p6176
aS'I noticed she wore running shoes: a fitting choice for a woman who never seemed to stop moving.'
p6177
aS'Her partner, Judith Kasen, grabbed me and asked me if I wanted to say hi.'
p6178
aS'I told her I could tell Edie seemed tired and ready to leave and that I didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to bother her.'
p6179
aS'She told me it was no bother.'
p6180
aS'We chatted for a bit, about the show and other things.'
p6181
aS'Judith told me that during my set Edie leaned over and told her I was her type.'
p6182
aS'I am sure I turned as red as the scarf Edie wore on those Supreme Court steps three years before.'
p6183
aS'Judith introduced us and I shook Edie\xe2\x80\x99s hand.'
p6184
aS'I showed her my wedding ring and said "thank you".'
p6185
aS'She beamed and said something to me, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t remember what because my brain was too busy realizing I was standing next to Edie Windsor.'
p6186
aS'We took one photo together, she and Judith left, and I wandered over to some friends that had come to the show, stunned that I had just met the woman who gave me my television show, my marriage and my life.'
p6187
aS'Pakistan is home to many Islamist terrorist groups.'
p6188
aS'Some enjoy a permissive environment despite technically being banned by the state.'
p6189
aS'This has enabled them to acquire political power.'
p6190
aS'Politicians sometimes court terrorist leaders to turn out voters.'
p6191
aS'While researching counterterrorism a few summers ago, I met with a high-ranking Pakistani official to talk about his decision to attend a campaign rally with the leader of a proscribed terrorist organization.'
p6192
aS'He admitted that getting the terrorist leader to turn out voters for a politician was his motivation.'
p6193
aS'He also suggested that encouraging such men get into politics was better than seeing them remain involved in terrorism.'
p6194
aS'I thought of that conversation last week when Pakistan\xe2\x80\x99s election commission   to recognize the Muslim Milli League, a new political party started by the social welfare arm of Lashkar-e-Taiba, the militant group notorious for the 2008 Mumbai attacks that killed 166 people.'
p6195
aS'The election commission also warned independent candidates for office not to use the party\xe2\x80\x99s name in campaigns.'
p6196
aS'If the commission had recognized the Muslim Milli League, that would have in effect allowed a terrorist organization to contest elections.'
p6197
aS'It could have opened the door for other militant groups in Pakistan \xe2\x80\x94 and several militant groups were already gearing up to establish their own political parties.'
p6198
aS'Pakistan has a long history of political parties using violence to prevail in elections.'
p6199
aS'Some parties have armed wings.'
p6200
aS'Others rely on associated militias and criminal networks.'
p6201
aS'Religious parties with ties to terrorist groups have contested elections for decades.'
p6202
aS'Members of outlawed terrorist organizations have also won elected office as independent candidates.'
p6203
aS'While no such organization had ever started its own party, Lashkar-e-Taiba and its social welfare wing, Jamaat-ud-Dawa, appeared well positioned to lead the charge.'
p6204
aS'On the advice of Inter-Services Intelligence Directorate, Pakistan\xe2\x80\x99s powerful spy agency, the group has changed its name several times since the Sept. 11 attacks to evade sanctions and escape bans.'
p6205
aS'The Pakistani government still differentiates between Lashkar-e-Taiba, which is banned, and Jamaat ud Dawa, which is not.'
p6206
aS'In reality, they remain two sides of a single organization, led by the same individuals.'
p6207
aS'The military and the intelligence service still support the group.'
p6208
aS'It remains their most reliable terrorist ally against India, sends fighters to Afghanistan, and has helped to combat separatists in Baluchistan, which borders Iran and Afghanistan.'
p6209
aS'But militancy is not the group\xe2\x80\x99s only mission.'
p6210
aS'It is also dedicated to proselytizing and nonviolent reformism intended to turn Pakistan into a "pure" Islamic state.'
p6211
aS'Many Pakistanis see Jamaat-ud-Dawa, which runs hospitals and ambulance services across the country, as a robust social welfare organization, and not an alias for a lethal terrorist group.'
p6212
aS'Debates about whether to take part in elections have been continuing for years, according to Laskhar-e-Taiba officials I have spoken with.'
p6213
aS'Yet starting a political party was a major step for an organization whose longstanding position was that Islam forbids participation in electoral politics.'
p6214
aS'The attempt to begin a party occurred at a time when the group and the Pakistani government are under increasing international pressure.'
p6215
aS'Pakistan might make a cosmetic distinction between Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jamaat-ud-Dawa, but the United States and the United Nations have designated both as terrorist groups.'
p6216
aS'The Financial Action Task Force, an international body focused on combating terrorist financing, has also zeroed in on Jamaat ud Dawa and its leader Hafiz Muhammad Saeed.'
p6217
aS'To placate the United States, the Pakistani government   in January and put his organization on a watch list for groups that may be involved in terrorism.'
p6218
aS'Recasting their organization as a political party could have provided Mr. Saeed and other leaders with more influence over how the state deals with their group.'
p6219
aS'It also would have given them greater freedom to operate, especially when it comes to raising money.'
p6220
aS'Rather than sucking recruits and resources away from Lashkar-e-Taiba, a new political party could have drawn in more of both.'
p6221
aS'In addition to political cover for its terrorist activities, this would have been another mechanism to influence the domestic discourse and promote hawkish policies toward India.'
p6222
aS'In theory, entering electoral politics can have a moderating influence on terrorist organizations and perhaps even create conditions for mainstreaming them.'
p6223
aS'Wasn\xe2\x80\x99t it preferable, the Pakistani official had asked me, for militants to involve themselves in elections than to continue engaging in terrorism?'
p6224
aS'Of course, it was.'
p6225
aS'Except Pakistan had never forced them to choose between terrorism and politics.'
p6226
aS'Instead, these men and the groups they led have been allowed to ply their terrorist trade while simultaneously increasing their political power.'
p6227
aS'It would be na\xc3\xafve to think that the election commission\xe2\x80\x99s decision is a harbinger of a shift in terms of Pakistan\xe2\x80\x99s policy of supporting and tolerating militant groups.'
p6228
aS'The men who lead them continue contesting elections as independent candidates and may persist in their attempts to register their proscribed organizations under different names.'
p6229
aS'But for the moment, the election commission has held the line against allowing terrorist organizations to contest elections in Pakistan.'
p6230
aS'Past the Ferris wheel, a line of young immigrants snaked into the crowded hallways of an event space on Chicago\xe2\x80\x99s Navy Pier.'
p6231
aS'It was August 2012.'
p6232
aS'I overheard two women wondering whether they should have showed up and gotten in the line, to apply for a new program that would let some undocumented people who had come to this country as children get a work permit.'
p6233
aS'"I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if we should trust the government," one of the women said.'
p6234
aS'"I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, either," the other replied.'
p6235
aS'"But I really want to work and help my mom pay rent".'
p6236
aS'It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t your choice to come to America.'
p6237
aS'But once you realize you\xe2\x80\x99re here illegally, it becomes your choice to figure out who gets to know that.'
p6238
aS'Can you tell your classmates that you can\xe2\x80\x99t join the overseas choir trip because you don\xe2\x80\x99t have a valid passport?'
p6239
aS'Can you tell your coach that you have to stay in the area and can\xe2\x80\x99t be recruited by an out-of-state college?'
p6240
aS'Can you tell a human resources manager that you can\xe2\x80\x99t get a driver\xe2\x80\x99s license because you don\xe2\x80\x99t have a Social Security number?'
p6241
aS'When you exist in a legal maze shrouded in doubts, every decision is a gut check.'
p6242
aS'In 2002, Pat Foote, a recruiter at The Seattle Times, told me that she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t offer me a summer internship because I am in the United States illegally.'
p6243
aS'I later made my way to Seattle just so that I could look her in the eye and ask that she not share my secret.'
p6244
aS'She was a stranger, the first potential employer I\xe2\x80\x99d ever told, and I asked for her trust.'
p6245
aS'The scariest stranger of all is the United States government.'
p6246
aS'It could deport you from the place you call home.'
p6247
aS'That\xe2\x80\x99s a fear I live with.'
p6248
aS'The landscape of trust shifted dramatically in 2012, when President Barack Obama issued a directive to establish the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program.'
p6249
aS'In addition to protecting immigrants who were brought to the United States before the age of 16 from deportation for a renewable two-year period, it granted a work permit to qualified immigrants who were under age 31 on June 15, 2012, the date of its announcement.'
p6250
aS'Applicants paid a $465 fee for processing and gave all their contact information (name, address, phone number) to the government they had grown up fearing.'
p6251
aS'In effect, the Obama administration said, "Trust us".'
p6252
aS'I did not qualify for DACA \xe2\x80\x94 I turned 31 four months before the policy was announced \xe2\x80\x94 but was thrilled for my younger undocumented friends who did qualify.'
p6253
aS'I carried that thrill with me to Chicago on the first day that people could apply.'
p6254
aS'Since then, an estimated 800,000 undocumented Americans across the country have received this deferred action.'
p6255
aS'As soon as news started leaking that President Trump, who campaigned on ending the program, would deliver on his promise, the questions came flooding in.'
p6256
aS'Friends whose lives and livelihoods depended on this promise the government had made needed to know: Will my boss still keep me on when DACA expires?'
p6257
aS'Will my scholarship continue?'
p6258
aS'How can I pay my mortgage?'
p6259
aS'Who can we trust now?'
p6260
aS'Can we trust President Trump, whose conflicting messages illustrate his ignorance of how DACA works?'
p6261
aS'Contradicting what the attorney general and the president have said in public, a   on DACA is making the rounds among my friends and colleagues, in group text messages and private Facebook groups.'
p6262
aS'"The Department of Homeland Security urges DACA recipients to use the time remaining on their work authorizations to prepare for and arrange their departure from the United States \xe2\x80\x94 including proactively seeking travel documentation \xe2\x80\x94 or to apply for other immigration benefits for which they may be eligible," the memo says.'
p6263
aS'After reading it, a friend who\xe2\x80\x99s a DACA recipient texted our group: "This is not a time for us to get fooled. This memo is telling us pack our bags".'
p6264
aS'Can we trust Congress, especially given that some Democrats and Republicans have historically used so-called Dreamers, named after the long-stalled Dream Act, as bargaining chips?'
p6265
aS'We can\xe2\x80\x99t know what President Trump and Congress will do.'
p6266
aS'But we do know who to trust now \xe2\x80\x94 the people we had to trust before.'
p6267
aS'To me, that means the teachers who see up close the injustice of life as an undocumented immigrant in this country.'
p6268
aS'The first adult I ever told I was here illegally was Mrs. Denny, my high school choir teacher.'
p6269
aS'It\xe2\x80\x99s a story I\xe2\x80\x99ve told many times, and   about too, because the moment meant so much to me.'
p6270
aS'After she announced to our class that we were going to Japan for spring break, I pulled her aside and said that I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t go.'
p6271
aS'"I don\xe2\x80\x99t have the right passport," I said.'
p6272
aS'Confused, Mrs. Denny replied: "Oh, it\xe2\x80\x99s O.K., Jose. We\xe2\x80\x99ll get you the right passport".'
p6273
aS'I told her it was more complicated than that, that I didn\xe2\x80\x99t have any piece of legal document that I could show, that I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t supposed to be here.'
p6274
aS'Her eyes widened, her lips pursed, and she didn\xe2\x80\x99t say another thing.'
p6275
aS'A couple of days later, to my surprise, she told the class that we were going to Hawaii instead.'
p6276
aS'Years later, she told me: "You were my kid. I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t going to leave any of my kids behind".'
p6277
aS'How many more Mrs. Dennys have made and will continue to make that decision?'
p6278
aS'In the first year of his presidency, Donald Trump has achieved at least three things that few presidents ever have.'
p6279
aS'His approval rating is in the 30s.'
p6280
aS'His former aides \xe2\x80\x94 and reportedly the president himself \xe2\x80\x94 are under federal investigation.'
p6281
aS'And members of Mr. Trump\xe2\x80\x99s own party are running what has been   to replace him in 2020.'
p6282
aS'But when I hear people talk of Mr. Trump\xe2\x80\x99s supposedly dismal future, I think of his not-so-dismal past.'
p6283
aS'I was the first national television correspondent to cover Mr. Trump full-time, so I know what can happen when people ignore the unbridled enthusiasm of his crowds.'
p6284
aS'For more than 500 days, I watched as Mr. Trump\xe2\x80\x99s campaign grew from an awkward rally around a backyard pool in June 2015 to a raucous, 10,000-person convention center event in November 2016.'
p6285
aS'In that same time, I also watched as Mr. Trump\xe2\x80\x99s candidacy survived a procession of death predictions.'
p6286
aS'Lately, it seems, those predictions are back.'
p6287
aS'Last month, when asked whether the president will be the Republican nominee in 2020, the Republican senator from Maine, Susan Collins, told MSNBC, "It\xe2\x80\x99s too difficult to say".'

aS'Every week there\xe2\x80\x99s a new last straw: Comey, Charlottesville, Arpaio.'
p6289
aS'If all else fails, Robert Mueller, the special counsel, will surely take him down, right?'
p6290
aS'When I was out on the road following Mr. Trump, I sneaked in a bit of "Game of Thrones" on my laptop between rallies.'
p6291
aS'What I learned, to paraphrase the show, is that what is dead may never die \xe2\x80\x94 and, in Mr. Trump\xe2\x80\x99s case, may only rise stronger.'
p6292
aS'Mr. Trump\xe2\x80\x99s candidacy was dead when he announced it.'
p6293
aS'(Mexico is sending "rapists".'
p6294
aS') His candidacy was dead when he insulted a former prisoner of war named John McCain.'
p6295
aS'("I like people who weren\xe2\x80\x99t captured".'
p6296
aS') His candidacy was dead when he cast suspicion on an entire religion.'
p6297
aS'("Donald J. Trump is calling for a complete and total shutdown of Muslims entering the United States".'
p6298
aS') Dead when he attacked a federal judge, a Gold Star family, the pope.'
p6299
aS'Deader than dead when he bragged about grabbing women by their genitals.'
p6300
aS'("When you\xe2\x80\x99re a star, they let you do it".'
p6301
aS') The more Mr. Trump\xe2\x80\x99s candidacy was said to flatline, the more life I saw in his crowds.'
p6302
aS'In August 2015, a month after a high-ranking Republican National Committee operative promised me that America would never tolerate a man with no military service disparaging an American military hero, I was standing on a football field in Mobile, Ala., surrounded by 30,000 screaming Trump fans, an unheard-of turnout six months before a primary.'
p6303
aS'Were they mad about the candidates words on Mr. McCain?'
p6304
aS'No.'
p6305
aS'The opposite.'
p6306
aS'"He\xe2\x80\x99s not afraid of anybody," one woman told me.'
p6307
aS'Of all the times Donald Trump was done, it is his current status as a supposedly lame duck first-term president that reminds me most of his final months on the trail.'
p6308
aS'Back then, luminaries in his own party were condemning him, calling on him to drop out and researching a late-race change to the top of the ticket.'
p6309
aS'Much of the country was outraged.'
p6310
aS'The polls were bleak.'
p6311
aS'No politician had ever come back from what Mr. Trump was facing.'
p6312
aS'But then, as now, the view from armchairs in Washington and newsrooms around the country missed something that it was impossible to miss out on the trail.'
p6313
aS'Mr. Trump\xe2\x80\x99s supporters were tired \xe2\x80\x94 of Washington, of the media, of waiting.'
p6314
aS'And that fatigue allowed them to overlook a lot.'
p6315
aS'They knew he was flawed but at least, they thought, he was on their side.'
p6316
aS'On one of Mr. Trump\xe2\x80\x99s primary victory nights, in a ballroom at Mar-a-Lago, surrounded by people in diamonds and silk, I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t help wondering what Mr. Trump\xe2\x80\x99s rally crowds would think of all the money their candidate chose to celebrate with.'
p6317
aS'"Why do people fighting for a raise relate to all of this"?'
p6318
aS'I asked a man in a tuxedo.'
p6319
aS'"Because deep down, they know he\xe2\x80\x99s one of them," he said.'
p6320
aS'"Trump sees us," his supporters would tell me, everywhere we stopped.'
p6321
aS'"You don\xe2\x80\x99t".'
p6322
aS'When they couldn\xe2\x80\x99t exactly cheer for him, they found ways to excuse him.'
p6323
aS'Five days after the "Access Hollywood" tape, for example, I asked an older woman in a flowery red dress what she thought of her candidate\xe2\x80\x99s theory of sexual license \xe2\x80\x94 as a lone protester was playing the tape on a loop outside a rally venue in Lakeland, Fla.'
p6324
aS'She smiled.'
p6325
aS'"What person hasn\xe2\x80\x99t said it"?'
p6326
aS'she said.'
p6327
aS'"I haven\xe2\x80\x99t said it," I said.'

aS'"You\xe2\x80\x99ve said you\xe2\x80\x99re going to grab women by the \xe2\x80\xa6 "?'
p6330
aS'I asked.'
p6331
aS'"No. Don\xe2\x80\x99t be stupid," she said, and walked away.'
p6332
aS'Shortly after, Mr. Trump was onstage, kissing a pink Women for Trump sign, really pressing his face against it.'
p6333
aS'The crowd roared because they thought it was funny and because it was a clear rebuke to anyone offended by what Mr. Trump waved away as "locker room talk".'
p6334
aS'Sometimes Mr. Trump\xe2\x80\x99s supporters had to justify or ignore his positions, too.'
p6335
aS'Sure, they liked a lot of his policies and ideas, but they weren\xe2\x80\x99t married to any of them.'
p6336
aS'They wanted the man above all.'
p6337
aS'And if he said it, they\xe2\x80\x99d find a way to support it, even if he reversed himself the next day.'
p6338
aS'I once asked a man heading into a rally why he supported Donald Trump.'
p6339
aS'"Because he is going to build a wall," the man said.'
p6340
aS'"What if he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t"?'
p6341
aS'I countered.'
p6342
aS'"I trust his judgment," the man said.'
p6343
aS'They trusted his judgment and on Election Day they trusted Mr. Trump more than they trusted any of us.'
p6344
aS'That\xe2\x80\x99s why when members of the media pronounced his candidacy dead, his supporters knew the opposite was true.'
p6345
aS'It was never more alive.'
p6346
aS'Maybe that has changed.'
p6347
aS'I don\xe2\x80\x99t know.'
p6348
aS'Nobody does.'
p6349
aS'The building blocks of political life are too complex to predict, too unstable to rely on.'

aS'But not this time.'
p6355
aS'During my childhood, campaign season was the only time we ate rice.'
p6356
aS'My mother would come home with a small portion of rice, a handout from a politician.'
p6357
aS'"Where did the rice come from"?'
p6358
aS'I would ask her, and she would say from someone campaigning, the name unimportant, her vote equally unassured.'
p6359
aS'As she served the rice to my siblings and our neighbors, she would repeat an old refrain: "Empty containers make a lot of noise".'
p6360
aS'My mother understood who the real winners and losers are in Kenyan politics.'
p6361
aS'Her allegiance was never to the politicians but to the people, from many tribes, with whom we lived.'

aS'I cowered under my bed, the walls of my shack made from discarded milk cartons the only barrier between the bullets outside and me.'
p6372
aS'Neighbors from different tribes who had lived together for years turned against one another in an instant.'
p6373
aS'One night, I planned to stay with friends in another part of Kibera.'
p6374
aS'By chance, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t make it to their house.'

p6376
aS'The next day, I fled for my safety.'
p6377
aS'As I left Kenya, I passed checkpoints where vigilantes asked at random to see ID cards, to establish ethnic identity.'
p6378

aS'So months ago I met with a childhood friend, Milar, one of Kibera\xe2\x80\x99s most influential residents.'
p6394
aS'Over beers, I asked him if he might consider becoming a peace ambassador, bridging divides in the run-up to the election.'
p6395
aS'He said yes, and over many weeks we met with hundreds of leaders across Kibera to preach an allegiance to our community instead of to the will of the political class.'

aS'Milar stepped in between the protesters and the police \xe2\x80\x94 his boldness shocked both sides.'

aS'Milar told the police commander that if the officers would retreat, he would in turn persuade the protesters to go home.'
p6399
aS'After a tense moment, the police agreed, and both sides pulled back.'
p6400
aS'A few days later, Milar saw a young woman wearing a T-shirt from the Jubilee party, a coalition led by President Uhuru Kenyatta, being beaten by a group of young men in Kibera, an opposition stronghold.'

aS'As Gen. H. R. McMaster, the national security adviser, wrote in his book "Dereliction of Duty," the early stages of the Vietnam War caught America\xe2\x80\x99s military leaders flat-footed.'
p6419
aS'Having gone through World War II and Korea, they were all ready for a conventional war.'
p6420
aS'But insurgencies and unconventional warfare were something else.'
p6421
aS'As a result, they were inordinately acquiescent to the wishful thinking of their civilian overseers \xe2\x80\x94 and no one thought more wishfully about the war than Walt Whitman Rostow.'
p6422
aS'A Yale Ph.D. and a Rhodes scholar, Rostow left his academic perch at M.I.T. to join the State Department under John F. Kennedy; he was later Lyndon Johnson\xe2\x80\x99s national security adviser during the center-cut of American involvement in Vietnam, from April 1966 to January 1969.'
p6423
aS'More than anyone else, he epitomized the overweening confidence of the civilian strategists of the era \xe2\x80\x94 he was the best and the brightest of "the best and the brightest".'
p6424
aS'He could lay distant claim to operational warfighting competence, having selected bombing targets as a major in the Office of Strategic Services during World War II.'
p6425
aS'But like many other prominent civilian strategists of the day, he was by training and disposition an economist and a technocrat.'
p6426
aS'In his 1960 book "The Stages of Economic Growth: A Non-Communist Manifesto," Rostow posited that robust growth was a nation\xe2\x80\x99s best insurance against the political emergence of Communism, and cast growth as a multistage process that depended crucially on a "takeoff" period propelled by rapid expansion in key segments of an economy.'
p6427
aS'Though criticized as tendentiously Western-centric, the book attracted Kennedy\xe2\x80\x99s attention.'
p6428
aS'In a matter of months, Rostow moved from holding forth in the academy to planning America\xe2\x80\x99s strategy in Vietnam, tightly guided by his ideas about economic development.'
p6429
aS'Most leading civilian strategists, who were so inventive and authoritative on nuclear strategy, steered a safe middle course between withdrawal and escalation in Vietnam, and did not enunciate big strategic concepts to guide the prosecution of the war.'
p6430
aS'Rostow was different.'
p6431
aS'He believed that the Vietcong were impeding South Vietnam\xe2\x80\x99s advancement to the takeoff stage, and that the United States therefore needed to expend all necessary military and diplomatic means to stop the Vietcong\xe2\x80\x99s guerrilla infiltration.'
p6432
aS'This was a neatly packaged but narrow vision that both opened the door to expansive military action but also reduced it to an adjunct of politics and economics.'
p6433
aS'Along those lines, Rostow reflexively argued for a "flexible response" when it came to military escalation, from ratcheting up the role of military "advisers" \xe2\x80\x94 that is, embedded Special Forces \xe2\x80\x94 in the early 1960s, to bombing North Vietnam starting in 1965, to steadily increasing the United States\xe2\x80\x99 expeditionary combat presence in the mid- and late 1960s.'
p6434
aS'Directly defeating the enemy was never the goal; military action was just a way to apply pressure, to maximize psychological intimidation \xe2\x80\x94 what came to be known as the "Rostow thesis".'
p6435
aS'But crucially, Rostow didn\xe2\x80\x99t actually know much about fighting a war.'
p6436
aS'Any soldier could have told him that increased bombing or troop levels were not the same as, say, increasing food aid.'
p6437
aS'Nor could one rely on data in the same way when it came to war.'
p6438
aS'Rostow was one of the most avid followers of the weekly body counts, equating the number of enemy reported killed with military progress, as if he were reading the latest reports on grain production.'
p6439
aS'In November 1967, an increasingly wary Robert McNamara, the secretary of defense, raised the idea of reassessing the war effort, shifting greater combat responsibility to the South Vietnamese \xe2\x80\x94 the policy that would become known as "Vietnamization" under President Richard Nixon \xe2\x80\x94 and a bombing halt.'
p6440
aS'Rostow agreed to the first two measures, but opposed the third, and President Johnson sided with him.'
p6441
aS'Despite McNamara\xe2\x80\x99s crisis of confidence \xe2\x80\x94 he departed the Pentagon in February 1968 \xe2\x80\x94 Rostow continued to comb through intelligence reports looking for reassuring factoids.'
p6442
aS'During the Tet offensive he denied even the possibility that the surprise attacks had provided a psychological shot in the arm to the Vietcong, concentrating instead on the huge casualties American and South Vietnamese forces had inflicted on them.'
p6443
aS'"This is a great victory for our side," he told a colleague while they sat in the White House Situation Room.'
p6444
aS'The ensuing 24-day battle for Hue, an agonizing engagement that American forces would also tactically win, drove home the strength of the enemy\xe2\x80\x99s determination and staying power.'
p6445
aS'But Rostow never saw the battle that way.'
p6446
aS'To the end, Rostow remained not just a supporter of the president, but a crutch.'
p6447
aS'As David Halberstam wrote of Rostow in "The Best and the Brightest": The upshot was that Rostow\xe2\x80\x99s status as designated administration hawk in chief induced in him a preoccupation with bureaucratic politics and buoying morale that impaired his strategic objectivity as American frustrations in Vietnam mounted.'
p6448
aS'He, more than any of Johnson\xe2\x80\x99s other advisers, was consumed with showing the press and the American public "light at the end of the tunnel".'
p6449
aS'The historian David Milne has called Rostow "America\xe2\x80\x99s Rasputin".'
p6450
aS'He was not alone as an early advocate for flexible response and a deepening commitment in Vietnam.'
p6451
aS'But long after McNamara and others turned against the war, even as evidence mounted against the Rostow thesis, he remained steadfast.'
p6452
aS'And while in the ensuing decades most of the advisers, including McNamara, admitted that they were wrong, Rostow,  , pointedly refused to apologize for the war or second-guess himself.'
p6453
aS'He remained a Cold Warrior until the end.'
p6454
aS'In 1986 he superficially attributed the fall of Saigon to Congressional budget cuts.'
p6455
aS'And he continued to insist that the war was worthwhile.'
p6456
aS'Joining a wave of historical revisionists, he argued that the war had bought time for other Southeast Asian nations to consolidate Western-leaning governments and subdue Communist influences \xe2\x80\x94 in other words, that the domino theory was right.'
p6457
aS'Like many of Kennedy\xe2\x80\x99s brain trust, Rostow was initially praised for his pragmatic, technocratic liberalism \xe2\x80\x94 but in his determination to impose his sterile ideas on the complicated realities of Southeast Asia, he proved to be as ideologically committed as the Communists he so adamantly opposed.'

aS'\xe2\x80\x94 This was the summer that the forests turned red.'

p6465
aS'What has made this fire season so terrifying isn\xe2\x80\x99t the size or intensity of the fires, awful as they were, but the enormous clouds of smoke that have come with them.'
p6466
aS'In many places, for days on end the sky has been enveloped in haze, the sun reduced to a hot, distant penny.'
p6467
aS'The smoke screens that have hit Seattle, San Francisco, Denver, Portland, Ore., and most of Montana are a product of the same enormous high-pressure system that incited a historic heat wave earlier in the summer.'
p6468
aS'The heat contributes to the fires, then the smoke gets trapped.'
p6469
aS'The West Coast\xe2\x80\x99s natural air-conditioning of Pacific Ocean wind hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been able to blow the smoke away.'

p6480
aS'The cedar trunks were nearly pulsating with color.'
p6481
aS'In Northern California during the Labor Day heat wave, the woods were changed, too.'
p6482
aS'The patches of sun on a trail at midmorning had the pastel cast of evening.'
p6483
aS'The natural detritus of the California woods \xe2\x80\x94 old bay and willow leaves, spent bracken and downed logs \xe2\x80\x94 looked ominous in the orange light.'

aS'Friends in Montana report that the haze and the smoke remind them of the recent solar eclipse.'
p6485
aS'Shadows go fuzzy, similar to how it was when the sun was at 25 percent of normal.'
p6486
aS'Everyone seems to agree that the sunsets have been epic, but that the moons are spooky: heavy peach globes, weirdly portentous.'
p6487
aS'One summer night in Washington, I saw a waxing crescent moon stained a red darker than blood.'
p6488
aS'It\xe2\x80\x99s hard not to think that these alterations are just a glimpse of things to come.'
p6489
aS'Perhaps this is the new normal of climate change.'
p6490
aS'With all the dust and smoke in the air, the world will begin to look different.'
p6491
aS'The sky will be milkier, less often intensely blue.'

aS'In 1893, the Norwegian artist Edvard Munch completed his most famous painting, "The Scream," with its haunting vibe of existential dread.'
p6496
aS'The nightmare image, with its swirls of deep reds and blues, was inspired by Munch\xe2\x80\x99s experience, a decade earlier, of witnessing an unearthly sunset, created in part by airborne particulates emitted by the eruption of the Indonesian volcano Krakatau, on the other side of the planet.'
p6497
aS'All of the ash from the volcano scattered the blue-violet wavelengths of light, just as the smoke blanketing the West is doing now.'
p6498
aS'At the sight of ruptured sky, Munch said he felt "a great, unending scream piercing through nature".'
p6499
aS'That\xe2\x80\x99s a pretty good description of what these smoke storms have felt like.'
p6500
aS'Maybe the strange, never-before-seen landscapes of our hot, hazy century will make for some incredible art.'

aS'\xe2\x80\x94 On Wednesday, Facebook revealed that hundreds of Russia-based accounts had run anti-Hillary Clinton ads precisely aimed at Facebook users whose demographic profiles implied a vulnerability to political propaganda.'
p6505
aS'It will take time to prove whether the account owners had any relationship with the Russian government, but one thing is clear: Facebook has contributed to, and profited from, the erosion of democratic norms in the United States and elsewhere.'
p6506
aS'The audacity of a hostile foreign power trying to influence American voters rightly troubles us.'
p6507
aS'But it should trouble us more that Facebook makes such manipulation so easy, and renders political ads exempt from the basic accountability and transparency that healthy democracy demands.'
p6508
aS'The majority of the Facebook ads did not directly mention a presidential candidate, according to Alex Stamos, head of security at Facebook, but "appeared to focus on amplifying divisive social and political messages across the ideological spectrum \xe2\x80\x94 touching on topics from L.G.B.T. matters to race issues to immigration to gun rights".'
p6509
aS'The ads \xe2\x80\x94 about 3,000 placed by 470 accounts and pages spending about $100,000 \xe2\x80\x94 were what the advertising industry calls "dark posts," seen only by a very specific audience, obscured by the flow of posts within a Facebook News Feed and ephemeral.'
p6510
aS'Facebook calls its "dark post" service "unpublished page post ads".'
p6511
aS'This should not surprise us.'
p6512
aS'Anyone can deploy Facebook ads.'
p6513
aS'They are affordable and easy.'
p6514
aS'That\xe2\x80\x99s one reason that Facebook has grown so quickly, taking in $27.6 billion in revenue in 2016, virtually all of it from advertisers, by serving up the attention of two billion Facebook users across the globe.'
p6515
aS'The service is popular among advertisers for its efficiency, effectiveness and responsiveness.'
p6516
aS'Facebook gives rich and instant feedback to advertisers, allowing them to quickly tailor ads to improve outcomes or customize messages even more.'
p6517
aS'There is nothing mysterious or untoward about the system itself, as long as it\xe2\x80\x99s being used for commerce instead of politics.'
p6518
aS'What\xe2\x80\x99s alarming is that Facebook executives don\xe2\x80\x99t seem to grasp, or appreciate, the difference.'
p6519
aS'A core principle in political advertising is transparency \xe2\x80\x94 political ads are supposed to be easily visible to everyone, and everyone is supposed to understand that they are political ads, and where they come from.'
p6520
aS'And it\xe2\x80\x99s expensive to run even one version of an ad in traditional outlets, let alone a dozen different versions.'
p6521
aS'Moreover, in the case of federal campaigns in the United States, the 2002 McCain-Feingold campaign-finance act requires candidates to state they approve of an ad and thus take responsibility for its content.'
p6522
aS'None of that transparency matters to Facebook.'
p6523
aS'Ads on the site meant for, say, 20- to 30-year-old home-owning Latino men in Northern Virginia would not be viewed by anyone else, and would run only briefly before vanishing.'
p6524
aS'The potential for abuse is vast.'
p6525
aS'An ad could falsely accuse a candidate of the worst malfeasance a day before Election Day, and the victim would have no way of even knowing it happened.'
p6526
aS'Ads could stoke ethnic hatred and no one could prepare or respond before serious harm occurs.'

aS'Daniel Kreiss, a communication scholar at the University of North Carolina, proposes that sites such as Facebook, Twitter and YouTube maintain a repository of campaign ads so that regulators, scholars, journalists and the public can examine and expose them.'

aS'Elected on the nationalist slogan "America first," President Donald Trump will use his debut address to the U.N. General Assembly to argue that individual nations should act in their own self-interest, yet rally together when faced with a common threat such as North Korea.'
p6600
aS'Trump, who has warned of "fire and fury" if North Korea does not back down, was expected to argue Tuesday that the dangers posed by Kim Jung Un\'s pursuit of a nuclear weapons program should unite all nations.'
p6601
aS'And he planned to issue not just warnings to North Korea but also rebukes to states that have enabled Pyongyang, though it was unclear if he would criticize China by name.'
p6602
aS'Addressing the General Assembly is a milestone moment for any president, but one particularly significant for Trump, a relative newcomer to foreign policy who has at times rattled the international community with his unpredictability.'
p6603
aS'He has pulled the Unites States out of multinational agreements, considered shrinking the U.S. military footprint in the world and deployed bombastic language on North Korea that has been criticized by other world leaders.'
p6604
aS'Trump frequently belittled the U.N. as a candidate and some within his White House believe the U.N acts as a global bureaucracy that infringes on the sovereignty of individual countries.'
p6605
aS'But the president was expected to stand before world leaders and a global audience and declare that U.N. members, acting as a collection of self-interested nations, should unite to confront global dangers, according to aides previewing his speech.'
p6606
aS"Beyond North Korea, crisis points the Republican president planned to address include Iran's nuclear agenda, the instability in Venezuela and the fight against terrorism in Syria and elsewhere."
p6607
aS'World leaders, many of whom will be seeing Trump in person for the first time, are bound to take the measure of the man and parse his every word for clues on how he views the U.S. role in the world and within the U.N. "It\'s a tremendous opportunity because the world wants to work with the United States if there\'s any way to do so," said Jon Alterman of the Center for Strategic and International Studies.'
p6608
aS'"He has an opportunity to show surprising openness".'
p6609
aS"' 'Make the United Nations great."
p6610
aS'Trump tipped his hand Monday as he riffed on his campaign slogan when asked to preview his central message to the General Assembly: "I think the main message is \'make the United Nations great\' \xe2\x80\x94 not \'again. \'" "Such tremendous potential, and I think we\'ll be able to do this," he added.'
p6611
aS'In brief remarks to the U.N. on Monday, Trump chastised the world body\'s bloated bureaucracy and budget, saying, "We are not seeing the results in line with this investment".'
p6612
aS'But even with that scolding, Trump pledged to the U.N. that the United States would be "partners in your work" to make the organization a more effective force for world peace.'
p6613
aS"He praised the U.N.'s early steps toward change and made no threats to withdraw U.S. support."
p6614
aS"The president's more measured tone stood in sharp contrast to the approach he took at NATO's new Brussels headquarters in May, when he upbraided member nations for not paying enough and refused to back its mutual defense pact explicitly."
p6615
aS'While running for office, Trump had labeled the U.N. weak and incompetent.'
p6616
aS'He has suggested it was "not a friend" to the United States or democracy while deriding it as "a club for people to get together, talk and have a good time".'
p6617
aS'He thundered often about putting "America first," and has withdrawn from what he considered multilateral agreements that he found unfavorable to the United States, such as the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal.'
p6618
aS'He also announced his intention to withdraw from the Paris climate accord, which would leave the U.S. one of only three countries outside the pact.'
p6619
aS'Aides have since suggested Trump would be willing to renegotiate terms of the deal but European leaders have dismissed that approach.'
p6620
aS'Trump has also frequently questioned the value of a robust American presence around the world.'
p6621
aS"When briefed on the government's diplomatic, military and intelligence posts, the new president would often cast doubt on the need for all the resources."
p6622
aS'Some aides have suggested that Trump employs "principled realism" \xe2\x80\x94 making global decisions based on the best outcome for the United States.'
p6623
aS'The administration has also shied away from talk of nation-building or creating democracies through the use of the U.S. military.'
p6624
aS'But Trump has softened his rhetoric about the United Nations since taking office and cheered the recent Security Council resolution that approved new sanctions against North Korea.'
p6625
aS'Potentially foreshadowing a Trump argument, Brian Hook of the State Department said Monday that the U.N. could be useful as a "force multiplier" to "bring a global approach to global threats".'

p6629
aS'The U.N. chief told presidents, prime ministers and monarchs at the opening of the General Assembly\'s annual ministerial meeting that millions of people are living in fear "under a shadow of dread cast by the provocative nuclear and missile tests" of North Korea.'
p6630
aS'His message on "fiery" rhetoric was implicitly directed at North Korea\'s leader Kim Jong Un, but also at the United States and President Donald Trump, who has warned of "fire and fury" if North Korea does not back down.'
p6631
aS'Guterres said a solution to the North Korea must be political and stressed to leaders: "This is a time for statesmanship".'
p6632
aS'Beyond the nuclear threat, Guterres painted a grim picture of a troubled world facing grave challenges with many people "hurting and angry" because they "see insecurity rising, inequality growing, conflict spreading and climate changing".'
p6633
aS'"Societies are fragmented," he said.'
p6634
aS'"Political discourse is polarized. Trust within and among countries is being driven down by those who demonize and divide".'
p6635
aS'"We are a world in pieces," Guterres said.'
p6636
aS'"We need to be a world at peace".'
p6637
aS'But Guterres said there are seven threats and tests that stand in the way: nuclear peril, terrorism, unresolved conflicts and systematic violations of international humanitarian law, climate change, rising inequality, unintended consequences of innovation, and people on the move.'

p6646
aS'Not far behind North Korea on the list of issues needing urgent international attention is the plight of Myanmar\'s Rohingya Muslims, victims of what Guterres calls a campaign of "ethnic cleansing" that has driven nearly 400,000 to flee into Bangladesh in the past three weeks.'

aS'In less than a decade, the world went from worrying about financial crashes to worrying about crashing democracies.'
p7006
aS'Starting in 2008, we were distressed over which economy would topple next, or whether the next banking crisis would wipe out people\xe2\x80\x99s savings.'
p7007
aS'Yet the Great Recession was not as prolonged as we feared \xe2\x80\x94 the hardest-hit economies have recovered, or are in the process of doing so.'
p7008
aS'What has not returned to precrisis mode is politics.'
p7009
aS'Today political parties \xe2\x80\x94 essential to strong democratic systems \xe2\x80\x94 are becoming something of an endangered species.'
p7010
aS'The aftermath of the economic downturn paved the way for the success of nontraditional political leaders like Donald Trump and made viable some once-unimaginable ideas, like  .'

aS'As salaries stagnated or even declined in the United States, Britain and other economically advanced democracies, the embattled middle class blamed   and globalization.'
p7013
aS'Immigration and international trade were seen as costly downsides to international integration.'
p7014
aS'Surprisingly, even emerging markets with fast-growing economies and stellar records of lifting people out of poverty, like Brazil, faced challenges from angry populations disappointed with their governments and empowered by social media and other new technologies.'
p7015
aS'In developing countries, it is common for people\xe2\x80\x99s expectations to grow at a faster pace than the capacity of the state to meet them.'
p7016
aS'Money is always short, and public institutions are often ineffective.'
p7017
aS'So even though the lives of hundreds of millions of people in Asia, Latin America and Africa are improving, that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean that people are content.'
p7018
aS'And it has become clear that economic progress and prosperity do not always buy political stability.'
p7019
aS'The global wave of political anger sweeping many rich and poor countries alike is also fed by a newfound impatience with corruption.'
p7020
aS'In the last decade, societies in which corruption used to be treated as a fact of life developed a strong intolerance to official thievery and ousted once-untouchable politicians.'
p7021
aS'In Brazil and India, Russia and Spain, people took to the streets to denounce corruption by the powerful.'
p7022
aS'And too often those in power were also leaders of traditional political parties.'
p7023
aS'When such leaders are caught stealing, it becomes another stain on parties, whose prestige and allure have been steadily waning.'
p7024
aS'These days, political parties are seen not as natural habitats for idealists but for fast-talking and often hypocritical opportunists and careerists.'
p7025
aS'The disdain for politics as usual \xe2\x80\x94 and therefore for parties locked in the status quo \xe2\x80\x94 is intense, widespread, global.'
p7026
aS'This is why anti-politics the rejection of traditional politics and its practitioners is such a popular instinct today.'
p7027
aS'The case of Tiririca vividly illustrates why.'
p7028
aS'In 2010 Francisco Everardo Oliveira Silva, known professionally as  , ran for a congressional seat in Brazil, campaigning in costume.'
p7029
aS'His message was honest and straightforward: "I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what a representative in Congress does, but if you send me there I will tell you".'
p7030
aS'He also explained that his goal was "to help people in need in this country \xe2\x80\xa6 but especially my family".'
p7031
aS'At the time, it was easy to dismiss Tiririca\xe2\x80\x99s run as an extreme anti-political gesture that could happen only in a rowdy young democracy like Brazil\xe2\x80\x99s.'
p7032
aS'But not for long.'
p7033
aS'The sentiment that propelled Tiririca to victory is similar to that which drove the political success of the comedian   in Italy, or that of Mr. Trump, a reality TV show host.'
p7034
aS'Both men were able to undermine the power of dominant parties.'
p7035
aS'While Mr. Grillo\xe2\x80\x99s   sought to displace Italy\xe2\x80\x99s political machine by positioning himself as a radical outsider, Mr. Trump took on traditional politics as a radical insider, staging a hostile takeover of the Republican Party.'

p7041
aS'Corrupt and ineffectual organizations need to be replaced by effective ones.'
p7042
aS'Yet many activists harbor the misconception that the answer lies in nongovernmental organizations, or in loose, nonhierarchical movements.'
p7043
aS'Democracies, however, need political parties.'
p7044
aS'We need permanent organizations that earn political power and govern, that are forced to articulate disparate interests and viewpoints, that can recruit and develop future government leaders and that monitor those already in power.'
p7045
aS'Political leaders need to have a stance on preschool education and nuclear weapons, health care and agriculture, and have well-articulated views on fighting terrorism and regulating banks, among myriad other policy issues.'
p7046
aS'And political parties are the training camps of these leaders.'
p7047
aS'To survive, political parties must regain the ability to inspire and mobilize people \xe2\x80\x94 especially the young \xe2\x80\x94 who might otherwise disdain politics or prefer to channel whatever political energy they have through single-issue groups.'

aS'Parties must be willing to overhaul their structures, mind-sets and methods to adapt to a new world.'

p7050
aS'In the decade since the financial crisis, almost everything we do \xe2\x80\x94 eating, reading, shopping, dating, traveling and communicating \xe2\x80\x94 was disrupted by new technologies and innovation.'

aS'In the wake of Russia\xe2\x80\x99s meddling in the 2016 United States election, the president\xe2\x80\x99s warning has a fresh, chilling resonance.'
p7055
aS'The debate in the United States about foreign interference concentrates on who did what to influence last year\xe2\x80\x99s election and the need for democracies to strengthen their cybersecurity for emails, critical infrastructure and voting platforms.'
p7056
aS'But we need to pay far more attention to another vulnerability: our adversaries\xe2\x80\x99 attempts to subvert our democratic processes by aiming falsehoods at ripe subsets of our population \xe2\x80\x94 and not only during elections.'
p7057
aS'In the Cold War era, Soviet attempts to meddle in American democracy were largely unsuccessful.'
p7058
aS'In 1982 Yuri Andropov, then the K.G.B. chairman, told Soviet foreign intelligence officers to incorporate disinformation operations \xe2\x80\x94 the so-called active measures meant to discredit adversaries and influence public opinion \xe2\x80\x94 into their standard work.'

p7065
aS'During the Cold War, most Americans received their news and information via mediated platforms.'
p7066
aS'Reporters and editors serving in the role of professional gatekeepers had almost full control over what appeared in the media.'
p7067
aS'A foreign adversary seeking to reach American audiences did not have great options for bypassing these umpires, and Russian dezinformatsia rarely penetrated.'
p7068
aS'While television remains the main source of news for most Americans, viewers today tend to select a network in line with their political preferences.'
p7069
aS'Even more significantly, The   Research Center has found that two-thirds of Americans are getting at least some of their news through social media.'
p7070
aS'After the election, around 84 percent of Americans polled by Pew described themselves as at least somewhat confident in their ability to discern real news from fake.'

p7075
aS'Last year the Russian government supplemented the growing reach of its state-owned, English-language media outlets \xe2\x80\x94 RT and Sputnik \xe2\x80\x94 by employing a network of trolls, bots and thousands of fake Twitter and Facebook accounts that amplified damaging stories on Hillary Clinton.'

p7086
aS'The sense of an epistemological free-for-all provides an opening to all comers.'

aS'Another reason for concern is that in 2017 any well-financed actor \xe2\x80\x94 political campaigns, companies, foreign governments \xe2\x80\x94 can harvest data (location, age, gender, likes, shares) on its target audience, personalizing messages to suit the taste of those it aims to reach and employing this customized propaganda to skew the political debate.'

p7094
aS'More recently, the alliance showed how Russia-linked accounts promoted alt-right conspiracies about the violence in Charlottesville, Va., as well as stories that slammed those \xe2\x80\x94 like Senator John McCain \xe2\x80\x94 who had criticized Mr. Trump\xe2\x80\x99s equivocal response.'

aS'Does free community college work?'
p7186
aS'An experiment in Chicago suggests that the answer is yes.'
p7187
aS'Two years ago, under a program called the Star Scholarship, Chicago began to offer free community college to all public high school graduates who earned a B average or higher and demonstrated near college-level proficiency in their work.'
p7188
aS'To keep costs for students low, they also get their textbooks free.'
p7189
aS'Since the program was created by Mayor Rahm Emanuel, roughly 1,000 students a year \xe2\x80\x94 about 5 percent of each Chicago Public Schools graduating class \xe2\x80\x94 have claimed their reward.'
p7190
aS'This fall, more than 2,900 of these students are attending the City Colleges of Chicago, the city\xe2\x80\x99s community college system, which has roughly 90,000 students.'
p7191
aS'Most of the Star Scholars are pursuing an associate degree so that they can transfer to a four-year college, but they can also earn certification in various fields along the way and head right into the work force if they choose.'
p7192
aS'Attending either full or part-time, they have up to three years to use the scholarship.'
p7193
aS'The early results of this initiative have been incredibly encouraging.'
p7194
aS'Two-thirds of the 890 Star Scholars who started in the fall of 2015 have either graduated or are currently enrolled with enough credits so that they are on course to complete their degree within three years, the federal benchmark for associate degree completion.'
p7195
aS'In fact, the percentage of students who graduated in two years (22 percent) is nearly the same as the national community college three-year graduation rate and the retention rate of these students after the first year (85 percent) was close to twice the national average for community college students.'
p7196
aS'This success is especially remarkable at the community college level, where the challenge of improving retention and graduation rates is just as pressing as the challenge of enhancing affordability.'
p7197
aS'Among the more than 200 students who have graduated already, more than two-thirds were the first in their families to go to college, more than 90 percent were members of minority groups and more than 60 percent were female.'
p7198
aS'To our knowledge, this is also the only public scholarship in the country open to undocumented immigrants who were brought to the country as children.'
p7199
aS'These are students like Arturo, a son of Mexican immigrants.'
p7200
aS'He attended a large public high school on Chicago\xe2\x80\x99s Northwest Side, where his intellectual curiosity was piqued by computer science classes.'
p7201
aS'Arturo says that without the Star Scholarship he would probably still be in the early stages of his community college career because he would have spent much of his time working a minimum-wage job to afford even the low-tuition cost.'
p7202
aS'Instead, Arturo graduated in two years this past May, and was awarded an additional scholarship from the CME Group, which operates financial exchanges.'
p7203
aS'CME also helped arrange a paid summer internship for him at a financial trading firm.'
p7204
aS'Arturo is now a junior at the state\xe2\x80\x99s four-year public university campus in Chicago, studying to become a software engineer.'
p7205
aS'A focus on merit has been a guiding principle of the Star program.'
p7206
aS'This helps keep the premise simple: if students work hard, they can go to community college free.'
p7207
aS'And as with Arturo, that opportunity can extend beyond community college.'
p7208
aS'More than half of the first graduating class was accepted at one or more of City Colleges\xe2\x80\x99 20 four-year college partners, all of which have agreed to offer discounted tuition.'
p7209
aS'For students who qualify for the program, this means that they can earn a four-year degree for essentially the cost of a year and a half of college, as long as they study hard from high school through community college.'
p7210
aS'During the 2016 election campaign, both Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton proposed plans that would free Americans from the enormous cost of college, which have put so many students into debt \xe2\x80\x94 and kept upward mobility out of reach.'
p7211
aS'But no legislation has passed on the national stage, and none is expected.'
p7212
aS'In the laboratories of the cities and the states, though \xe2\x80\x94 in New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Indiana, Montana, Minnesota, Kentucky, Nevada, Washington and Arkansas, as well as Detroit, Pittsburgh, New Haven, Kalamazoo, Mich., Oakland, Calif., and Tulsa, Okla.'
p7213
aS'\xe2\x80\x94 local governments have created or are considering plans to cover tuition for a select number of students or to greatly reduce the cost of college tuition.'
p7214
aS'Among the states, perhaps Tennessee has gone the farthest, offering two years of tuition-free community college for all high school graduates.'
p7215
aS'City Colleges picks up the cost after all other forms of financial aid has been applied.'
p7216
aS'Chicago\xe2\x80\x99s plan funds the scholarship with general operating funds from property taxes.'
p7217
aS'Historically strong reserves have enabled City Colleges to make this commitment, and an endowment is being created as we find more efficient ways of running our programs and sell underutilized assets.'
p7218
aS'Recognizing that a high school diploma is no longer sufficient for success, the Star Scholarship program is part of a broader initiative afoot in Chicago to create a seamless "K to 14" system.'
p7219
aS'Earlier this year, Mayor Emanuel announced an effort to ensure that all Chicago public high school students graduate with a plan for what they will do after high school, whether it is going to a four-year or two-year college, a job, the military, an internship or something else.'
p7220
aS'The city is also engaging high school students with college-level work as soon as they are ready by offering free college courses.'
p7221
aS'Chicago\xe2\x80\x99s dual enrollment-dual credit program, with high school students taking free college classes, has grown more than tenfold since 2011, serving more than 4,000 students last year.'
p7222
aS'More than 200 high school students graduated last spring with a full semester of college credit this way.'
p7223
aS'It is no coincidence that the vast majority of Star graduates this year were among the cohort of students who earned college credit while still in high school.'
p7224
aS'Students not only save money, they also earn the confidence that they can succeed in college-level courses.'
p7225
aS'A well-earned sense of self-assurance is another reason our retention rates are so high.'
p7226
aS'What we have seen in Chicago is that when the entire community wraps its arms around students who are willing to work hard, the dream of a college education does not have to be accompanied by the nightmare of a sea of debt.'
p7227
aS'America decided in the early 20th century that high school was the baseline of free public education.'
p7228
aS'In the early 21st century, a postsecondary credential is the new requirement for a family-sustaining career.'
p7229
aS'To help our students meet this higher educational bar, we must create educational programs that reflect that new reality.'

aS'Last week, Senator Bernie Sanders introduced "Medicare for all" legislation, which would enroll all Americans into the nation\xe2\x80\x99s Medicare program within four years.'

p7232
aS'Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Kamala Harris of California and over a dozen of their Senate Democratic colleagues have co-sponsored the  .'
p7233
aS'Representative John Conyers, Democrat of Michigan, and state lawmakers in California have also proposed "single payer" health plans.'
p7234
aS'Though we have widely divergent views on health policy \xe2\x80\x94 one of us preferring a German-style system (Dr. Weinberg), the other a more consumer-directed one (Dr. Chen) \xe2\x80\x94 we both believe that single-payer health care, including the proposal advanced by Senator Sanders, is the wrong choice for the country.'
p7235
aS'We recently conducted an analysis of international health systems and concluded that single-payer advocates are substantially overstating the prevalence and success of such systems.'
p7236
aS'While many other countries have universal health systems and feature more government control over individual health care decisions, almost none are actually single-payer.'
p7237
aS'And all of them are wrestling with largely the same challenges Americans are, making different but equally difficult trade-offs on cost, quality and access.'
p7238
aS'As Democrats and other policy makers debate the merits of Senator Sanders\xe2\x80\x99s proposal, here are a few important observations about international systems that they ought to consider.'
p7239
aS'First, a vanishingly small number of countries actually have single-payer systems.'
p7240
aS'In fact, almost all feature some role for private-sector insurance companies and providers.'
p7241
aS'Britain, which employs providers in its National Health Services, has a parallel private payment system.'
p7242
aS'In countries like Canada \xe2\x80\x94 the system most similar to the one that Mr. Sanders seeks to create \xe2\x80\x94 private corporations provide insurance for services that fall outside of government guarantees.'
p7243
aS'And these guaranteed benefits are substantially more limited than those in the Sanders proposal.'
p7244
aS'Canada, for example, has no national prescription drug benefit but instead a patchwork of provincial systems.'
p7245
aS'Some of the highest-rated international systems rely on private health insurers for most health care coverage \xe2\x80\x94 Germany\xe2\x80\x99s, for example, is something like Obamacare exchanges for everyone, but significantly simpler and truly universal.'
p7246
aS'The Netherlands and Switzerland have both moved recently to add more competition and flexibility to systems that were already built on the use of private insurers.'
p7247
aS'Second, single-payer countries have also failed to control rising health care costs.'
p7248
aS'This is important, given that Mr. Sanders\xe2\x80\x99s proposal was released without a cost estimate or financing plan.'
p7249
aS'For historical reasons, many other countries started with lower levels of health care spending than we did.'
p7250
aS'Several   have shown that this has almost nothing to do with higher administrative costs or corporate profits in the United States and almost everything to do with the higher cost of health care services and the higher salaries of providers here.'
p7251
aS'Although they started at a lower base \xe2\x80\x94 with, for example, doctors and nurses receiving lower salaries \xe2\x80\x94 countries around the world have all struggled with rising costs.'
p7252
aS'From 1990 to 2012, the United States\xe2\x80\x99 rate of health care cost growth was below that of many countries, including Japan and Britain.'
p7253
aS'In 2015, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development   that rising health care costs across all countries were unsustainable.'
p7254
aS'Third, it is simply untrue that single-payer systems produce a better quality of care across the board.'
p7255
aS'Most health-policy lectures in American universities start with a slide showing that we rank poorly on a broad number of public health measures and outcomes.'
p7256
aS'Yet the United States scores much more highly on different measures, including innovation, patient-centered care and preventive health.'
p7257
aS'Specialty care is better in many categories, although more needs to be done to create broader access to these services.'
p7258
aS'The American health system excels, for example, in cancer care.'
p7259
aS'And while we spend more on it than any other country, we find ourselves at the top of most international rankings in reducing the death rate of patients with preventable cancer deaths, as a product of this spending.'
p7260
aS'In truth, all systems make trade-offs when it comes to allocating health care resources, and they all largely get what they pay for.'
p7261
aS'To the extent that other countries achieve better public health outcomes, they do it primarily through more generous, rather than more efficient, social spending.'
p7262
aS'When you add together health and social spending across countries, the United States is no longer a major outlier when it comes to per capita costs spent on factors that promote health.'
p7263
aS'American policy makers can and should look abroad for examples of reforms that work.'
p7264
aS'For example, many other countries have encouraged smarter public and private investments into factors that promote health and wellness, like stable housing and employment opportunities, rather than spending more overall on health care once people are sick.'
p7265
aS'But just as trade-offs must be made to improve health care, so are other countries struggling with balancing the cost and quality of care and universal access.'
p7266
aS'All Americans should bear one important precept in mind: If the Sanders plan sounds too good to be true, it probably is.'
p7267
aS'A couple of years ago, European researchers began  , gay and straight, in which one member had been infected with H.I.V. and the other hadn\xe2\x80\x99t.'
p7268
aS'These couples weren\xe2\x80\x99t using condoms.'
p7269
aS'But the infected partner was taking antiretrovirals successfully; the virus was suppressed, undetectable in the blood.'
p7270
aS'The researchers published their results in July 2016 in the Journal of the American Medical Association.'
p7271
aS'Can you guess how many times, over the course of more than a year, an infected partner gave an uninfected partner H.I.V.?'
p7272
aS'A. 928 B. 0 C. 503 D. 17 The answer is B. Zero.'
p7273
aS'And in that fact lies hope.'
p7274
aS'How do you stop AIDS?'
p7275
aS'Not just treating H.I.V., but ending the epidemic.'
p7276
aS'Even when there\xe2\x80\x99s no vaccine and no cure.'
p7277
aS'Part of the answer can be witnessed in a white trailer on the grounds of a polyclinic in Hatcliffe, a dusty town in the northern part of greater Harare, Zimbabwe.'
p7278
aS'Even before the trailer opens each day, the benches outside are full of people waiting for a checkup or a fresh supply of medicine for H.I.V. or the diseases that pounce on weakened immune systems.'
p7279
aS'Hatcliffe\xe2\x80\x99s clinic, like all public clinics in Harare, charges $5 for visits that don\xe2\x80\x99t involve either H.I.V. or tuberculosis.'
p7280
aS'That may seem like a bargain to Americans.'
p7281
aS'But Zimbabwe is in an economic crisis, making millions of people struggle just to buy their staples of cornmeal, sugar and cooking oil.'
p7282
aS'The clinic is supposed to offer medicines free, but has run out of many, said Sheila Chiedza, the nurse who runs it.'
p7283
aS'(A doctor visits on Wednesdays.'
p7284
aS') The clinic must send patients to a pharmacy to purchase what they need.'
p7285
aS'"If we don\xe2\x80\x99t have it here, we are not sure if they can get it," Chiedza said.'
p7286
aS'For most Zimbabweans, then, medical care at the public clinic is a financial hardship.'
p7287
aS'But H.I.V. and tuberculosis care are different: Drugs are free, each clinic visit costs just one dollar, and most patients come four times a year.'
p7288
aS'When I visited in August, the trailer\xe2\x80\x99s back office was crowded with staff members entering data.'
p7289
aS'I asked how well patients did on their AIDS meds.'
p7290
aS'"Ninety percent undetectable," said a young man who gave his name as Mr. Edwards.'
p7291
aS'This seemed unbelievably high.'
p7292
aS'In the United States, the figure is about  .'
p7293
aS'But the clinic may not have been exaggerating.'
p7294
aS'Zimbabwe is one of the world\xe2\x80\x99s worst-governed countries and has suffered a staggering economic decline.'
p7295
aS'But it\xe2\x80\x99s doing right by people with H.I.V. \xe2\x80\x94 a lot better than the United States.'
p7296
aS'Every epidemic has a tipping point.'
p7297
aS'When the transmission rate drops below that point, it begins to recede.'
p7298
aS'For H.I.V., reaching the tipping point requires three things: that 90 percent of people with the virus know they have it, that 90 percent of that group are taking antiretroviral medicines to keep the epidemic in check, and that 90 percent of those taking medicine control the virus to the point where it is undetectable and therefore cannot be transmitted.'
p7299
aS'So having the world at 90-90-90 is the   by 2020.'
p7300
aS'If you reach 90-90-90, you end up with 73 percent of people with H.I.V. being noncontagious.'
p7301
aS'That 73 percent is the tipping point, at which the epidemic starts to burn out.'
p7302
aS'Achieving 73 percent is hard.'
p7303
aS'In the United States, the figure is only 30 percent.'

aS'A recent survey in which researchers went door to door testing people\xe2\x80\x99s blood found that Zimbabwe is much closer,  .'

p7310
aS'A large part of this success is due to George W. Bush, whose administration established the President\xe2\x80\x99s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, or Pepfar, in 2004.'
p7311
aS'Its impact is now evident in the trailer in the yard of Hatcliffe Polyclinic and just about every such trailer in countries with a large H.I.V. burden.'
p7312
aS'Of course, Bush\xe2\x80\x99s initiative wasn\xe2\x80\x99t alone.'
p7313
aS'Pepfar programs are dwarfed by the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Malaria and Tuberculosis, which began working around the world in 2002.'
p7314
aS'Most governments take H.I.V. seriously, and campaigns by a global network of people living with H.I.V. and their supporters achieved those victories.'
p7315
aS'Pepfar began work in seven African countries in 2004, and also contributed to the Global Fund.'
p7316
aS'Now it works in 22 African countries, along with some in Asia and Latin America.'
p7317
aS'In the past three and a half years, Pepfar has doubled the number of people for whom it provides treatment.'
p7318
aS'It has added a million children in the past two years.'

p7321
aS'Everyone I spoke with agrees.'
p7322
aS'This is all the more remarkable given the economic catastrophe of the past 10 years (in 2009, the central bank issued a   that was worth about $30 in U.S. currency) and given Zimbabwe\xe2\x80\x99s repression.'

p7325
aS'Gay men there, he says, "are probably not coming in to be tested".'
p7326
aS'Still, here\xe2\x80\x99s what Zimbabwe has done right: It put its own money into fighting H.I.V. In 1999, the country instituted a 3 percent tax on income and corporate profits to fund AIDS programs.'
p7327
aS'That continues, although the totals collected have suffered in synchrony with a failing economy.'
p7328
aS'But few other poor countries have tried to do as much to pay for fighting the disease.'
p7329
aS'Some of the country\xe2\x80\x99s leaders on H.I.V. are serious and competent, including Tsitsi Apollo, who directs the country\xe2\x80\x99s response.'

aS'Deborah Birx, the United States\xe2\x80\x99 global AIDS coordinator and head of Pepfar, said that the biggest global challenge is the first 90 in the 90-90-90 formula: getting people tested so that they know their H.I.V. status.'
p7331
aS'It\xe2\x80\x99s especially difficult to reach young people, so Pepfar focuses on them.'
p7332
aS'"More than half of men under 35 and almost a third of women under 25" who have H.I.V. don\xe2\x80\x99t know they\xe2\x80\x99re infected, Birx said.'

aS'That changed between 1965 and 1967, when the Americanization of the war brought hundreds of thousands of troops and civilians into the country and put an American face on the increasingly widespread destruction wrought by both sides.'
p7383
aS'Bui Diem noted the absence of communication between the two peoples during the major escalation in 1965, the "un-self-conscious arrogance" of the Americans and the impotence of the South Vietnamese.'
p7384
aS'"The Americans came in like bulldozers and the South Vietnamese followed their lead without a word of dissent, for the most part without a thought of dissent".'
p7385
aS'After 1965, the United States took on the burden of defeating the enemy militarily.'
p7386
aS'It declined to establish a combined command structure with the South Vietnamese, as it had in Korea.'
p7387
aS'It relegated the Army of the Republic of Vietnam to pacification, a task many Vietnamese considered demeaning.'
p7388
aS'Americanization of the war also produced among South Vietnamese a "takeover effect," inviting them to stand by and let the Americans fight the Viet Cong and North Vietnamese.'
p7389
aS'Tragically, American actions encouraged dependency in a nation whose independence it sought to sustain.'
p7390
aS'As the American presence swelled, tensions between the two peoples grew.'
p7391
aS'Vietnamese resented the way their visitors looked down on them and imposed their ways on a presumably inferior people.'
p7392
aS'They were annoyed by American impatience.'
p7393
aS'Some envied the opulent lifestyle of the Americans, with their enormous bases equipped with all the conveniences of home, including air conditioning, shopping centers and movie houses.'
p7394
aS'Others protested that the troops acted "despicably" toward them, speeding their trucks and cars through traffic at life-threatening speeds.'
p7395
aS'Some claimed that America dispensed aid as though it were being "given to a beggar".'
p7396
aS'Most of all, many South Vietnamese resented their dependence on their ally and its suffocating presence in their lives.'
p7397
aS'Some labeled the "American occupation" a "demoralizing scourge".'
p7398
aS'Vietnamese recognized that the Americans were not "colonialists," the journalist Robert Shaplen observed, but, he perceptively added, "there has evolved here a colonial ambience that can sometimes be worse than colonialism itself".'
p7399
aS'In the bonanza atmosphere that followed Americanization, South Vietnam\xe2\x80\x99s economy centered upon serving the needs of the new arrivals.'
p7400
aS'Prostitution became a special problem.'
p7401
aS'As the number of Americans in Saigon surged into the tens of thousands, the number of houses of ill repute expanded proportionally, provoking criticism in the United States and South Vietnam.'
p7402
aS'Senator J. William Fulbright of Arkansas fumed that Saigon had become an "American brothel".'
p7403
aS'South Vietnamese Catholics and President Nguyen Van Thieu were especially concerned about prostitution, and pleaded with American officials to do something about the suffocating presence of so many troops.'
p7404
aS'The result was Operation Moose (Move Out of Saigon Expeditiously), implemented mostly during 1967.'
p7405
aS'Thousands of G.I.s moved to base camps outside the city (where the prostitutes soon followed), some joking that they had been "Moosed".'
p7406
aS'Saigon was also declared off limits for R & R. The pace was sufficiently slow that the operation was unofficially tagged Goose (Get Out of Saigon Eventually).'
p7407
aS'The exodus left around 7,900 American soldiers in the city.'
p7408
aS'Moose did not satisfy President Thieu, and it provided no more than a partial solution to the prostitution problem.'
p7409
aS'It also left Saigon more vulnerable to the urban attacks launched by the Viet Cong during the 1968 Tet offensive.'
p7410
aS'The American way of war also inflicted a huge toll on village life in South Vietnam.'
p7411
aS'To limit its own casualties and cope with unfamiliar and often inhospitable terrain, the United States unleashed extraordinary firepower on the country it was trying to save.'
p7412
aS'Areas of suspected enemy strength were bombed and shelled and burned with napalm, often with little consideration of its impact on civilians.'
p7413
aS'Defoliants were used to deny the enemy food and cover, with horrific short- and long-term consequences for Vietnamese.'
p7414
aS'American firepower destroyed homes, villages and crops and alienated those whose hearts and minds were to be won.'
p7415
aS'American commanders declared entire areas free-fire zones.'
p7416
aS'Troops would round up villagers, burn their hooches and relocate them from their ancestral lands into squalid refugee camps.'
p7417
aS'The area would then be bombed and shelled.'
p7418
aS'During Operation Cedar Falls in 1967, Americans forcibly relocated some 6,000 civilians from the village of Ben Suc.'
p7419
aS'Caught between the Viet Cong and the Americans, villagers who wanted only to be left alone became sullen or outright hostile.'
p7420
aS'By early 1967, over 1.5 million refugees had drifted into urban slums, where they were susceptible to Viet Cong propaganda.'
p7421
aS'To be sure, many Americans developed close ties with Vietnamese.'
p7422
aS'Many also committed acts of kindness such as providing medical care and food to people in need.'
p7423
aS'Especially in the early years and in remote areas, American advisers formed attachments with Vietnamese soldiers and villagers.'
p7424
aS'Thousands of troops married Vietnamese women.'
p7425
aS'Still, most Americans arrived in the country without knowledge of the land and the people.'
p7426
aS'"My time in Vietnam is the memory of ignorance," one soldier later wrote.'
p7427
aS'Not knowing the language or culture, the Americans did not know what the people felt, or even at times how to tell friend from foe.'
p7428
aS'"What we need is some kind of litmus paper than turns red when it\xe2\x80\x99s near a Communist," one officer half-jokingly told a journalist.'
p7429
aS'Relations with South Vietnamese soldiers were likewise strained.'
p7430
aS'Unaware of the difficulties their counterparts labored under, American troops disparaged their fighting qualities.'
p7431
aS'The newcomers expected the people they were defending to offer the sort of gratitude they believed their fathers had gained for liberating France in World War II.'
p7432
aS'When instead they encountered indifference or even hostility, they grew resentful.'
p7433
aS'For many Americans, the South Vietnamese became an object of contempt, even hatred.'
p7434
aS'"The people were treacherous," one soldier later recalled.'
p7435
aS'"They say \xe2\x80\x98G.I. No. 1\xe2\x80\x99 when we\xe2\x80\x99re in the village, but at night the dirty little rats are V.C." The ability of the villagers to step around mines and booby traps that killed and maimed Americans provoked suspicion of collusion \xe2\x80\x94 and anger.'
p7436
aS'Americans also brought with them deeply entrenched racist attitudes that prompted the use of slurs such as "gook" and "dink," which they applied to enemy and friend alike.'
p7437
aS'Contempt could quickly change to a rage that might be turned on Vietnamese civilians.'
p7438
aS'During the summer and fall of 1967, the notorious Tiger Force, an elite commando unit, was assigned to remove civilians from the Song Ve River Valley, suspected to be a source of rice for Viet Cong units.'
p7439
aS'The very name of the mission, Operation Rawhide, suggested a cattle roundup, which had a dehumanizing effect.'
p7440
aS'When the civilians resisted, the Tigers vented their rage by burning their villages.'
p7441
aS'Unhappy with the assignment and under constant fire from enemy snipers, the Americans declared the area a free-fire zone and shot anything that moved, resulting in the brutal killing of numerous civilians.'
p7442
aS'Nevertheless, the Tigers were assigned another, similar mission, to remove civilians from Quang Tin province.'
p7443
aS'Early in the operation, they were caught in a deadly ambush and suffered heavy losses.'
p7444
aS'After that, all restraints came off.'
p7445
aS'Commanders abetted their vengeance by setting a body count goal of 327 kills (to match the number of the 327 Infantry Regiment, of which the Tigers were a part).'
p7446
aS'The Tigers proceeded to kill hundreds of civilians and compounded their crime by mutilating the bodies of victims, including old women and even babies.'
p7447
aS'The carnage stopped only when the operation ended in November.'
p7448
aS'The actions of the Tiger Force were replicated with even more savage results at My Lai, in Quang Ngai province, in February 1968, where American soldiers killed hundreds of Vietnamese civilians.'
p7449
aS'Such atrocities were not typical of American behavior, and even at My Lai there were soldiers who pushed back against their commanders\xe2\x80\x99 orders to kill.'
p7450
aS'Nevertheless, the atrocious violence reflected attitudes toward Vietnamese that divided the two peoples and made the Vietnamese subservient to Americans.'
p7451
aS'Given the frustrations and failures and mounting casualties of the American war effort, atrocities were perhaps only a matter of time.'
p7452
aS'I was 13 when the black woman I was rooting for on "American Idol" won.'
p7453
aS'After black women failed to reach the top spot in the first two seasons, Fantasia finally did.'
p7454
aS'With vocals straight out of a church choir in North Carolina, she deserved it.'
p7455
aS'All the black people I knew \xe2\x80\x94 my mom, classmates and acquaintances \xe2\x80\x94 were so proud.'
p7456
aS'We celebrated this moment together.'
p7457
aS'Fantasia\xe2\x80\x99s victory on one of America\xe2\x80\x99s most watched television shows at the time wasn\xe2\x80\x99t just a win for her: It was a win for  .'
p7458
aS'Issa Rae, a co-creator and the star of the HBO sitcom "Insecure," stood on the Emmys\xe2\x80\x99 red carpet on Sunday and proudly proclaimed to a Variety reporter who asked which people she was cheering for, "I\xe2\x80\x99m rooting for everybody black".'
p7459
aS'When I heard that, I jumped up and shouted: "Same, Sis! Same"!'
p7460
aS'Because that\xe2\x80\x99s what I\xe2\x80\x99ve been doing all my life.'
p7461
aS'And apparently many other people have, too, because Variety\xe2\x80\x99s video went viral on Twitter, garnering more than 16,000 retweets and countless reshares up and down my social media timelines.'
p7462
aS'Ms. Rae told the reporter what so many black people have told their family members at dinner, their friends on group texts and their black co-workers over water cooler talk.'
p7463
aS'As many obstacles as we face in our lives, there are times when we   to see one another win.'
p7464
aS'But what so many people missed in her comment is that expressing black pride is not the same as being racist toward whites.'
p7465
aS'"Talk about racist! You are one"!'
p7466
aS'a Twitter user wearing a "Make America Great Again" hat wrote.'
p7467
aS'Ms. Rae\xe2\x80\x99s critics don\xe2\x80\x99t understand that when it comes to racial pride, the playing field is not level.'
p7468
aS'Black pride does not carry the power to shut others out as white pride does.'
p7469
aS'And that\xe2\x80\x99s the difference.'
p7470
aS'Hollywood has a long history of privileging whiteness, from who gets to greenlight movie ideas to whom studios target for consumption.'
p7471
aS'While white people have the luxury of turning on any given channel and seeing themselves reflected with nuance and depth onscreen, black people haven\xe2\x80\x99t been so fortunate.'
p7472
aS'So it\xe2\x80\x99s no surprise that Issa Rae, who is redefining how TV shows portray black millennials, gave her black colleagues props at the Emmys.'
p7473
aS'In fact, it\xe2\x80\x99s the support from black viewers who religiously watched her web series "Awkward Black Girl" that helped her become the first black woman to create and star in a scripted series for HBO.'
p7474
aS'Though "Insecure" wasn\xe2\x80\x99t nominated this year, Ms. Rae was there to unequivocally support others who broke down more of Hollywood\xe2\x80\x99s white-male-dominated doors.'
p7475
aS'And it was genuine: Later that night, she   her congratulations to Lena Waithe, who became the first black woman to win an Emmy for comedy writing.'
p7476
aS'Get.'
p7477
aS'Yours.'
p7478
aS'Boo!'
p7479
aS'"You\xe2\x80\x99ve been killing it for SO long! @LenaWaithe #Emmys #BlacksAllZay #SaidWhatISaid," she wrote, affirming her initial comment.'
p7480
aS'You got next!'
p7481
aS'Ms. Waithe replied with reciprocal support: "Love you sis! I have a feeling your speech gon be way funnier than mine".'
p7482
aS'When black artists are honored at an esteemed award show like the Emmys, it\xe2\x80\x99s no secret whom we want to win.'
p7483
aS'The fact that black actors, writers and directors in 2017 are still becoming the "first" black person to ever receive "X" award should make that clear.'
p7484
aS'Black pride isn\xe2\x80\x99t designed to block the progress of others.'
p7485
aS'It is meant to empower and create space for black people to celebrate and honor ourselves in a country that tells us in no uncertain terms that black lives do not matter.'
p7486
aS'It\xe2\x80\x99s a necessary escape when racial tension in the world is too much to bear.'
p7487
aS'It\xe2\x80\x99s a tool for survival in a world that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want to see you win.'
p7488
aS'We take enormous joy in seeing Lena Waithe, Donald Glover and Sterling K. Brown walk away with trophies.'
p7489
aS'Their wins give us more hope that our stories will be told in more nuanced, sensitive and multidimensional ways.'
p7490
aS'We will continue to celebrate one another and will always be "rooting for everybody black".'
p7491
aS'MEXICO CITY \xe2\x80\x94 When the earthquake rattled this mountain capital on Tuesday, a five-story office and apartment block round the corner from my home collapsed into a mountain of rubble, burying computer programmers, salesmen, secretaries.'
p7492
aS'Right away, a handful of neighbors approached the wreckage, calling to see if anyone was alive and removing debris.'
p7493
aS'Within hours, the group had swelled into the hundreds, joined by volunteers from across the city arriving by foot, truck and bicycle.'
p7494
aS'The volunteers shoveled rubble into buckets and cleared it from the scene in human chains.'
p7495
aS'Firefighters, civil defense workers and finally soldiers arrived and labored in unison with the civilians.'
p7496
aS'At intervals, they would shout for people to be silent and raise their fists as they listened for the sounds of survivors.'
p7497
aS'Hundreds more volunteers organized to supply water, food and tools as the force worked through the night.'
p7498
aS'This immense human effort, shown in the pictures of ordinary men and women sweating with spades, running with wheelbarrows, passing stretchers over their heads will surely be the lasting image of the 7.1 magnitude tremor that struck Mexico less than two weeks after a more distant 8.1 earthquake.'
p7499
aS'It is a story of tragedy, but also of solidarity and hope.'
p7500
aS'"I felt I had to do something," says Sergio Fragoso, a 31-year-old music producer, who came on a borrowed bike to toil at the site for 16 hours straight, his determination conquering his exhaustion.'
p7501
aS'"I thought about what it would be like if it was me trapped under there. I would want people to help".'
p7502
aS'Similar scenes were repeated at dozens of collapsed buildings across the battered capital as thousands of volunteers worked nonstop.'
p7503
aS'Their efforts paid off, with more than 50 people rescued by the end of Wednesday, the mayor announced.'
p7504
aS'On Thursday morning, workers used jackhammers to break up the last concrete blocks left at the building near my home.'
p7505
aS'The entire office block had been cleared in less than two days, an incredible physical feat.'
p7506
aS'The effort was all the more impressive considering the scale of the devastation.'
p7507
aS'Electricity and phone lines were down in much of the city, streets were blocked by debris and broken glass, and it was difficult to move anywhere.'
p7508
aS'People were scrambling to find their own loved ones and get them to hospitals.'
p7509
aS'I saw a man running through the street with an unconscious girl in his arms, another stumbling with a bleeding head into an ambulance.'
p7510
aS'Many abandoned their cracked homes, fearing they could also collapse.'
p7511
aS'But despite people\xe2\x80\x99s own problems, they were ready to help those they didn\xe2\x80\x99t even know.'
p7512
aS'The roots of this human force lie in the earthquake that hammered Mexico City on exactly the same day 32 years earlier and killed thousands.'
p7513
aS'Back then, civilian brigades also formed, although they took longer to mobilize and didn\xe2\x80\x99t work alongside soldiers.'
p7514
aS'It was an era of one-party rule, and the government tried to hide the scale of the damage and stop civilians from helping, worried that groups of Good Samaritans in the streets could turn into political protesters.'
p7515
aS'The stories of those volunteers of 1985 feature strongly in the collective memory of Mexico City residents, known as "chilangos".'
p7516
aS'When the nightmare was relived, the new generation drew on this memory to act.'
p7517
aS'Lorenzo Meyer, a politics professor and author, joined the volunteer forces of 1985, and is proud that his grown-up children took to the streets this week.'
p7518
aS'He described the stark differences between the two experiences.'
p7519
aS'"Back then, we took almost two days to get to the buildings," he said.'
p7520
aS'This time, there were text messages and social media feeds telling people where to go.'
p7521
aS'"It was very hard to find information on what was happening. And now the social energy is so strong it\xe2\x80\x99s impossible to repress".'
p7522
aS'The brigades of 1985 had an impact on Mexican politics, Dr. Meyer said.'
p7523
aS'Angry with a government they saw as uncaring, these empowered volunteers sought change.'
p7524
aS'Many became activists fighting to end the hegemonic rule of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or P.R.I. The capital became a bastion of opposition, and the P.R.I. lost political control of it in 1997, before losing the presidency in 2000, after seven decades.'
p7525
aS'The latest mass mobilization may also have a lasting political effect.'
p7526
aS'The country now has multiparty democracy, and more open media and civil society.'
p7527
aS'But people are angry about officials embezzling millions of dollars, governors working with drug traffickers and brutal violence that haunts communities.'
p7528
aS'The P.R.I. returned to power in 2012 under President Enrique Pe\xc3\xb1a Nieto, but he has suffered his own corruption scandals and his approval ratings have at times dropped to the teens.'
p7529
aS'A certain political reaction to the earthquake is already erupting.'
p7530
aS'As it became clear that thousands had lost their homes from the tremor, people started online petitions calling for Mexico\xe2\x80\x99s electoral institute to redirect hefty campaign finances for a presidential vote next year to earthquake relief.'
p7531
aS'One of   rapidly topped a million signatures.'
p7532
aS'A group created to support the petitions,  , emphasizes the links between the political movements of past and present.'
p7533
aS'"After the earthquake of 1985, Mexican civil society showed a power of solidarity and union without precedent; now we need it again," it says on its page on the Change.org petition website.'
p7534
aS'A heightened awareness of people power could favor the presidential hopeful Andr\xc3\xa9s Manuel L\xc3\xb3pez Obrador, who trumpets a populist anti-establishment discourse from the left.'
p7535
aS'A former Mexico City mayor, he already leads many opinion polls for the 2018 election as he calls for "el pueblo" to defeat a "mafia of power".'
p7536
aS'However, the advantage could swing to an independent candidate who offers an alternative to politicians and appeals to the many young professionals in the ranks of the volunteer brigades.'
p7537
aS'Various personalities, including a TV anchor, an academic and a human rights defender, have expressed interest in running.'
p7538
aS'It could also strengthen Mexico\xe2\x80\x99s resolve against the aggressive stance of the Trump administration, Dr. Meyer said.'
p7539
aS'Around the rubble, the armies of volunteers often raise their fists and shout in unison, "Viva M\xc3\xa9xico".'
p7540
aS'"When we shout this, there is an implication that we are standing up to the hostile policies of the United States," Dr. Meyer said.'
p7541
aS'"After all of the recent insults, the humiliations, it is a way of reaffirming our pride".'
p7542
aS'\xc2\xa0Rachel Myrick, of Fredericksburg, Va., was walking through the foyer of a LongHorn Steakhouse in Spotsylvania County earlier this month when she felt a sharp pain in her left foot, according to local media.'
p7543

p7544
aS'She tried to brush it off and keep going, she told the paper, but felt such a sharp pain she dropped her cellphone and her wallet". I had my fingers under my foot and that\xe2\x80\x99s when I felt something moving," Myrick, a real-estate agent, told the newspaper.'
p7545
aS'Myrick had been bitten twice on her toes and once on the side of her foot by a roughly 8-inch-long copperhead.'
p7546
aS'The bites left her in hospital for 11 days". I freaked out," said Myrick, who recalled yelling, "I got bit! I got bit"!'
p7547
aS'"It hit the floor between my son, Dylan, and my boyfriend, Mike. Both of them instantaneously stepped on it, stepped on its head and killed it right in that foyer area," Myrick told Washington, D.C., radio\xc2\xa0station WTOP.'
p7548
aS'After the snake was dead, emergency services were called and Myrick was taken to hospital, where she stayed until Sunday.'
p7549
aS'She was given anti-venom shots and other treatments to reduce the swelling, which spread up to the top of her leg.'
p7550

p7552
aS'"My entire life is upside down at this point".'
p7553
aS'Myrick told the Free Lance-Star that doctors had said that it will probably take her at least three months to recover.'
p7554
aS'Meanwhile, she\xe2\x80\x99s using crutches to avoid putting pressure on her foot". It\xe2\x80\x99s painful just to ride in the car," she told the paper.'

p7562
aS"\xc2\xa0The FBI's\xc2\xa0annual report on violent crime statistics\xc2\xa0released Monday\xc2\xa0tracked a growing priority of\xc2\xa0the Trump administration, which has offered ominous warnings since Inauguration Day of a growing crime problem in America and a re-emergence of violent criminal gangs."
p7563
aS'While overall violent crime rates in much of the country do not compare with the high-water marks of more than two decades ago, Attorney General Jeff Sessions has been traveling the country since taking office earlier this year and warning that the nation was again vulnerable to violence that ravaged local communities in the 1980s and 1990s.'
p7564
aS'\xc2\xa0"For the sake of all Americans, we must\xc2\xa0confront and\xc2\xa0turn back the rising tide of violent crime," Sessions said Monday.'

p7566
aS'Overall violent crime was up 4.1% last year, while murder increased by 8.6%, according to new FBI statistics.'
p7567
aS'Last year, the FBI reported violent crime rose by 3.9% in 2015, while murder jumped by 10.8%.'
p7568
aS'The surges appeared to be driven by increases in murders\xc2\xa0in Chicago, Baltimore and some other large cities where violence persisted even as neighboring communities reported declines.'
p7569
aS'An analysis by the the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University\xc2\xa0School of Law found that overall crime in the U.S. had dropped due to sustained declines in property-related offenses.'
p7570
aS'Burglary, vehicle theft and larceny has declined for 14 straight years.'
p7571
aS'But murder increases were driven by violence in many of the country\'s 30-largest cities". Chicago accounted for more than 20% of the nationwide murder increase in 2016, despite being home to less than 1% of the U.S. population," the center concluded.'

p7573
aS'"Crime remains near historic lows, with an uptick in murder and violence driven in part by problems in some of our nation\xe2\x80\x99s largest cities. At the same time, other cities like New York are keeping crime down".'

aS'Despite the increases in violence, Inimai Chettiar, director of the Brennan Center\'s Justice Program, challenged the Trump administration\'s contention that "crime is out of control".'
p7575
aS'"Chicago, for example, has had serious issues that need to be addressed," Chettiar said.'

aS'U.S. stocks surged, the dollar extended gains and Treasuries slumped on speculation the plan will become law this year.'

p7703
aS'But that\xe2\x80\x99s not firmly set, as congressional tax-writing committees will be given flexibility to add a fourth rate for the highest earners -- an effort to prevent the overhaul from providing too much of a benefit for the wealthy.'

p7732

p7940
aS'Those words,  , a distinguished professor of philosophy at M.I.T., well express the moral energy behind the feminist ferment currently shaking American philosophy.'

p7949
aS'The editors of the recent "Routledge Companion to Feminist Philosophy" note that feminist philosophy "originated in feminist politics" and "included from the start discussion of feminist political issues and positions".'
p7950
aS'Nowadays, major feminist philosophers often define their work in explicitly political terms.'
p7951
aS'Elizabeth Anderson, for example, says that feminist epistemology and philosophy of science "identifies ways in which dominant conceptions and practices of knowledge attribution, acquisition, and justification systematically disadvantage women and other subordinated groups, and strives to reform these conceptions and practices so that they serve the interests of these groups".'
p7952
aS'And Sally Haslanger, in her seminal analysis of gender and race, says, "At the most general level, the task is to develop accounts of gender and race that will be effective tools in the fight against injustice".'

aS'She goes on to offer the following definition of "woman": "S is a woman [if and only if] S is systematically subordinated along some dimension \xe2\x80\x94 economic, political, legal, social \xe2\x80\x94 and S is \xe2\x80\x98marked\xe2\x80\x99 as a target for this treatment by observed or imagined bodily features presumed to be evidence of a female\xe2\x80\x99s biological role in reproduction".'
p7954
aS'Philosophers uneasy with strong feminist claims about the current poor treatment of women \xe2\x80\x94 or who just think it\xe2\x80\x99s wrong to presuppose such claims in philosophical discussions \xe2\x80\x94 may feel that feminist philosophy has nothing to offer them.'
p7955
aS'Even sympathetic male philosophers may see such philosophy as the province of women, particularly since most writing on feminist topics is by women and feminists sometimes seem not to welcome male contributions.'
p7956
aS'(The 56 essays in the "Routledge Companion" are all by women.'
p7957
aS') In fact, however, feminist philosophy should be an essential resource for all philosophers, whatever their views about its political agenda.'
p7958
aS'To see why, it will help to reflect on an earlier disruption to the philosophical establishment: the "pluralist revolt" against the dominant analytic philosophy of the 1970s and \xe2\x80\x9980s.'
p7959
aS'The pluralists were a disparate group of philosophers: pragmatists in the tradition of Peirce, James and Dewey; metaphysicians following classical thinkers such as Aristotle and Aquinas or the process philosophy of Whitehead; and, most prominently, "continental philosophers" working out of recent European movements such as phenomenology (Husserl, Heidegger, Sartre); post-structuralism (Foucault, Derrida); and critical theory (Habermas and the Frankfurt School).'
p7960
aS'Pluralists challenged the dominance of the A.P.A. by the analytic philosophy that they saw as modeling itself on mathematics and natural science.'
p7961
aS'This mode of thought, they said, imposed standards of conceptual clarity and logical rigor that restricted philosophical thinking to a narrow range of abstract and artificial questions.'
p7962
aS'These restrictions, they argued, marginalized pluralist philosophers and, more important, excluded the great perennial questions that had defined philosophy from Plato to Hegel.'

aS'The pluralists gained a good deal of power within the A.P.A., made room for alternative voices and no doubt played a role in the broadening of analytic interests.'
p7964
aS'Their efforts supported an increased interest in traditional questions, particularly in metaphysics and ethics, and a turn to pragmatic positions in epistemology.'
p7965
aS'But the pluralists did not overcome the analytic hegemony, with analytic philosophers remaining a large majority in the most highly regarded departments.'
p7966
aS'Further, the pluralists did little to blunt the sharp division between analytic philosophy and so-called continental philosophy, which maintained its own (relatively marginalized) departments, national organization and journals.'
p7967
aS'Indeed, we are now seeing a good deal of work on "continental" philosophers move from philosophy to other humanistic disciplines (for example, in language, communication and film studies departments) and to the softer social sciences.'
p7968
aS'Today, feminist philosophy has produced an awakening far beyond that of the pluralist revolt.'
p7969
aS'It has already further broadened and deepened analytic philosophy and shows promise of promoting serious engagement with continental thinkers.'
p7970
aS'It\xe2\x80\x99s interesting that the new feminist directions sometimes derive from the stereotypical roles that society has imposed on women.'
p7971
aS'In ethics, as Rosemarie Tong and Nancy Williams note in their Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy article on feminist ethics, "proponents of feminist care ethics \xe2\x80\xa6 stress that traditional moral theories \xe2\x80\xa6 are deficient to the degree they lack, ignore, trivialize, or demean values and virtues culturally associated with women".'
p7972
aS'So, for example, societies have often directed women toward subordinating their interests to others (husbands or children, for example).'
p7973
aS'As a result, women tend to be particularly sensitive to "care" as an ethical value, and feminist philosophers (like Nel Nodding and Virginia Held) have developed various "ethics of care" that supplement or displace "masculine" ethical values such as autonomy and self-fulfillment.'
p7974
aS'Even an other-directed principle such as "Act for the greatest happiness of all" takes on a deeper meaning when understood not as a duty toward generic humanity but as a call to personal engagement with those in need.'
p7975
aS'In a different vein, women live in a society that presents as "natural" what they experience as arbitrary constraints.'
p7976
aS'This can provide them with a particular sensitivity to injustices that are due less to individual ill will than to the structures of established practices and institutions.'
p7977
aS'Feminist social philosophers like Nancy Fraser have developed this line of thought in dialogue with the work of Marx, Foucault, Habermas and other continental thinkers.'
p7978
aS'Feminist epistemologists have developed the notion of situated knowledge to counter standard analytic approaches that treat knowledge as the goal of an isolated mind (\xc3\xa0 la Descartes), abstracted from concrete life situations such as the knower\xe2\x80\x99s body, emotions, values and social roles.'
p7979
aS'Continental traditions like Marxism and existential phenomenology have long emphasized such situated knowledge.'
p7980
aS'But feminist philosophers like Louise Antony and Helen Longino have offered strong analytic arguments for enriching the "masculinist" view of knowledge with elements previously ignored, perhaps as signs of "feminine" cognitive weakness.'
p7981
aS'Similarly, feminist metaphysicians have argued that metaphysical distinctions between superior and inferior categories (mind/matter, essential/contingent, self/other) were often used to express male superiority.'
p7982
aS'This has led to the suggestion that such dichotomies did not express eternal necessities but rather historically constructed social categories \xe2\x80\x94 a suggestion feminists found supported by the work of continental philosophers like Simone de Beauvoir and Michel Foucault.'
p7983
aS'Feminists\xe2\x80\x99 personal and political rage against injustice (and parallel emotional reactions against their claims) could, of course, create an atmosphere inimical to fruitful philosophical reflection.'
p7984
aS'But looking at the significant achievements of feminist philosophers, feminism promises to improve not only the climate for women but also philosophical thinking itself.'

aS'Price staying, however, raises the risk of a drumbeat of stories about his use of the jets when at least two other cabinet officials -- Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt -- are also facing questions over similar use of private or government aircraft.'

aS'They are economically viable, with a well-developed energy industry.'
p8202
aS'They have functioning institutions, including elections for Parliament and a relatively free media.'

aS'President Trump has the chance to demonstrate American leadership, promote American values and strengthen an American ally.'
p8220
aS'Israel would welcome his support for the Kurds.'
p8221
aS'And if handled intelligently, the pragmatic Arab states such as Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Jordan and the United Arab Emirates could follow suit, on the grounds that Kurdistan could serve as a bulwark against Iran and the Islamic State.'
p8222
aS'If we wait for the region to be perfectly stable, for Islamist extremism to disappear or for the collective blessing of Ankara, Tehran and Baghdad, we could be waiting forever.'

aS'Pakistan is often seen as a country with a small Birkin-bag-sporting elite, a poverty-ridden mass and little in between.'
p8225
aS'The reality is that Pakistan does have a large urban population, which identifies itself as middle class.'
p8226
aS'Being middle class is a status closely associated with a progressive modernity \xe2\x80\x94 in Pakistan, in India \xe2\x80\x94 that individuals and successive governments alike yearn for.'
p8227
aS'In undivided, colonial India, the term "middle class" was associated with Indian officials, bureaucrats, doctors, lawyers and teachers who were linked to the colonial state.'
p8228
aS'But while they displayed the values and ambitions of the modernizing English middle class \xe2\x80\x94 mediating between the rulers and the ruled \xe2\x80\x94 many of them came from aristocratic and landed backgrounds.'
p8229
aS'After the formation of Pakistan in 1947, the families employed in the colonial government were at the forefront of the national project of modernization, along with emerging groups such as urban professionals from India and educated families from smaller towns in Punjab.'
p8230
aS'They are known as the "old middle class" in contemporary Pakistan.'
p8231
aS'Their children don\xe2\x80\x99t work for the state but tend to be employed at midlevel and top positions in the more lucrative private sector.'
p8232
aS'In Lahore, Pakistan\xe2\x80\x99s second-largest city, old middle-class families distance themselves from the upwardly mobile through their genealogical ties to prestigious families, local notables and their display of affinity for the "lost" culture of the 1950s and 1960s.'
p8233
aS'They share photos and stories of Ava Gardner staying at Faletti\xe2\x80\x99s Hotel during the filming of "Bhowani Junction" and Dizzy Gillespie playing saxophone with a snake charmer \xe2\x80\x94 evidence of a period when Pakistan enjoyed a more favorable global reputation.'
p8234
aS'The old middle class sees Pakistan as being on the path toward modernity before the Islamization agenda of Gen. Zia-ul-Haq (1978-88) brought upheaval.'
p8235
aS'Their nostalgia influences foreign commentators, who tend to showcase events, such as literary festivals, that glorify the earlier progressive history of the country.'
p8236
aS'Implicit in these portrayals is a vilification of the upwardly mobile groups whose more visible religiosity is viewed as the legacy of General Zia.'
p8237
aS'It is these groups that constitute the new urban middle class that has emerged since the 1980s.'
p8238
aS'In Lahore, many of them are second-generation migrants from small towns and rural areas in Punjab.'
p8239
aS'Products of the state education system of the 1980s \xe2\x80\x94 a time when General Zia gave religious clergy free rein and curbed political parties \xe2\x80\x94 most members of the new middle class are familiar with the discourses of Islamic groups.'
p8240
aS'While many are sympathetic to Islamist parties\xe2\x80\x99 call for social justice, and some have had affiliations with such groups, few are lasting members.'
p8241
aS'Support for an Islamist party is often issue-based and transient, and in most cases, does not translate into votes.'
p8242
aS'The new middle class has a strong sense that the solution to Pakistan\xe2\x80\x99s problems lies in becoming better Muslims and instilling Islamic values.'
p8243
aS'But it is also conspicuous for its members\xe2\x80\x99 considerable investment in the latest mobile phones and consumer electronics, along with frequent trips to Western-style shopping malls, megastores and markets in Lahore.'
p8244
aS'Careful attention is paid to rearing children: using branded diapers instead of local nappies, buying clothes from well-known Pakistani labels and feeding them Western-style snacks, such as chicken nuggets and instant noodles.'
p8245
aS'Yet twinned with the desire for consumption is anxiety about such exhibition and how to sustain it.'
p8246
aS'Most homes possess microwaves and mixer-grinders, but their owners use them sparingly and store them in their original packaging.'
p8247
aS'They buy sofas to match what they see in soap operas and advertisements, but protect them with plain sheets that are removed only on special occasions.'
p8248
aS'Families on the poorer end of the new middle class visit malls and shopping spaces for recreational experiences.'
p8249
aS'They rarely make purchases from such places and prefer to look for the same or similar goods in cheaper bazaars and wholesale markets.'
p8250
aS'Their ability to find more economical deals becomes a way to distinguish themselves from the presumed decadent and self-indulgent upper classes.'
p8251
aS'Members of the new middle class covet government employment, which still remains a mark of status, but such work does not provide sufficient income to sustain their idealized level of middle-class consumption.'
p8252
aS'Many in this group augment their state income through investment in real estate.'
p8253
aS'Many families in new middle-class circles have acquired their current status through money made by a relative in a semiskilled job in the Gulf countries or North America.'
p8254
aS'The most significant waves of semiskilled labor migration from Pakistan over the past half-century have been for industrial work in Britain in the 1960s, construction labor in Saudi Arabia and the Gulf in the 1970s and 1980s and, since the 1980s, taxi driving, construction and restaurant employment in the United States.'
p8255
aS'Pakistan received $20 billion in remittances in 2016, according to the World Bank.'
p8256
aS'The visible religiosity of the new middle class is often identified as the Wahhabi Islam of Saudi Arabia.'
p8257
aS'However, it is not Wahhabi Islam but the globalized Islam practiced by Muslims in the West that better explains contemporary religious trends.'
p8258
aS'Made familiar with Muslim practices abroad through relatives living abroad and returning migrants, many members of the new middle class have started incorporating them in their own lives.'
p8259
aS'For instance, Quran schools and religious study circles, where the Quran is studied with translation and interpretation, were introduced in Lahore in the early 2000s by returnees from the United States.'
p8260
aS'Similarly, many women have replaced dupattas and chadors \xe2\x80\x94 the traditional ways of showing modesty in public \xe2\x80\x94 with head scarves and cloaks similar to those worn by relatives in the West, Saudi Arabia or the Gulf.'
p8261
aS'It is not so much the desire to be closer to the heartland of Islam that prompts these changes, but the desire to display a modern Muslim identity, a shift commensurate with their economic progress.'
p8262
aS'Denied the status of modernity in the local class hierarchy, these groups look for it through a familiarity with a global Muslim community.'
p8263
aS'Just as the old middle class gains its modern status through a narrative that is used to explain Pakistan to the outside world, so the new middle class attempts to use its own connections to the West to assert its modernity.'
p8264
aS'Let me begin with thanks to the Lowy Institute for bringing me all the way to Sydney and doing me the honor of hosting me here this evening.'

p8268
aS'This has become the depressing trend on American university campuses, where the roster of disinvited speakers and forced cancellations includes former Secretaries of State Henry Kissinger and Condoleezza Rice, former Harvard University President Larry Summers, actor Alec Baldwin, human-rights activist Ayaan Hirsi Ali, DNA co-discoverer James Watson, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, filmmaker Michael Moore, conservative Pulitzer Prize-winning columnist George Will and liberal Pulitzer Prize-winning columnist Anna Quindlen, to name just a few.'

p8271
aS'This is a subject that is dear to me \xe2\x80\x94 literally dear \xe2\x80\x94 since disagreement is the way in which I have always earned a living.'
p8272
aS'Disagreement is dear to me, too, because it is the most vital ingredient of any decent society.'
p8273
aS'To say the words, "I agree" \xe2\x80\x94 whether it\xe2\x80\x99s agreeing to join an organization, or submit to a political authority, or subscribe to a religious faith \xe2\x80\x94 may be the basis of every community.'
p8274
aS'But to say, I disagree; I refuse; you\xe2\x80\x99re wrong;   \xe2\x80\x94 these are the words that define our individuality, give us our freedom, enjoin our tolerance, enlarge our perspectives, seize our attention, energize our progress, make our democracies real, and give hope and courage to oppressed people everywhere.'
p8275
aS'Galileo and Darwin; Mandela, Havel, and Liu Xiaobo; Rosa Parks and Natan Sharansky \xe2\x80\x94 such are the ranks of those who disagree.'
p8276
aS'And the problem, as I see it, is that we\xe2\x80\x99re failing at the task.'
p8277
aS'This is a puzzle.'
p8278
aS'At least as far as far as the United States is concerned, Americans have rarely disagreed more in recent decades.'
p8279
aS'We disagree about racial issues, bathroom policies, health care laws, and, of course, the 45th president.'
p8280
aS'We express our disagreements in radio and cable TV rants in ways that are increasingly virulent; street and campus protests that are increasingly violent; and personal conversations that are increasingly embittering.'
p8281
aS'This is yet another age in which we judge one another morally depending on where we stand politically.'
p8282
aS'Nor is this just an impression of the moment.'
p8283
aS'Extensive   show that Republicans are much more right-leaning than they were twenty years ago, Democrats much more left-leaning, and both sides much more likely to see the other as a mortal threat to the nation\xe2\x80\x99s welfare.'
p8284
aS'The polarization is geographic, as more people live in states and communities where their neighbors are much likelier to share their politics.'
p8285
aS'The polarization is personal: Fully 50 percent of Republicans would not want their child to marry a Democrat, and nearly a third of Democrats return the sentiment.'
p8286
aS'Interparty marriage has taken the place of interracial marriage as a family taboo.'
p8287
aS'Finally the polarization is electronic and digital, as Americans increasingly inhabit the filter bubbles of news and social media that correspond to their ideological affinities.'
p8288
aS'We no longer just have our own opinions.'
p8289
aS'We also have our separate "facts," often the result of what different media outlets consider newsworthy.'
p8290
aS'In the last election, fully 40 percent of Trump voters named Fox News as their chief source of news.'
p8291
aS'Thanks a bunch for that one, Australia.'
p8292
aS'It\xe2\x80\x99s usually the case that the more we do something, the better we are at it.'
p8293
aS'Instead, we\xe2\x80\x99re like Casanovas in reverse: the more we do it, the worse we\xe2\x80\x99re at it.'

aS'Our disagreements may frequently hoarsen our voices, but they rarely sharpen our thinking, much less change our minds.'
p8295

aS'* * * Thirty years ago, in 1987, a philosophy professor at the University of Chicago named Allan Bloom \xe2\x80\x94 at the time best known for his graceful translations of Plato\xe2\x80\x99s "Republic" and Rousseau\xe2\x80\x99s "Emile" \xe2\x80\x94 published a learned polemic about the state of higher education in the United States.'
p8297
aS'It was called "The Closing of the American Mind".'
p8298
aS'The book appeared when I was in high school, and I struggled to make my way through a text thick with references to Plato, Weber, Heidegger and Strauss.'
p8299
aS'But I got the gist \xe2\x80\x94 and the gist was that I\xe2\x80\x99d better enroll in the University of Chicago and read the great books.'
p8300
aS'That is what I did.'
p8301
aS'What was it that one learned through a great books curriculum?'
p8302
aS'Certainly not "conservatism" in any contemporary American sense of the term.'
p8303
aS'We were not taught to become American patriots, or religious pietists, or to worship what Rudyard Kipling called "the Gods of the Market Place".'
p8304
aS'We were not instructed in the evils of Marxism, or the glories of capitalism, or even the superiority of Western civilization.'
p8305
aS'As I think about it, I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure we were taught anything at all.'
p8306
aS'What we did was read books that raised serious questions about the human condition, and which invited us to attempt to ask serious questions of our own.'
p8307
aS'Education, in this sense, wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a "teaching" with any fixed lesson.'
p8308
aS'It was an exercise in interrogation.'
p8309
aS'To listen and understand; to question and disagree; to treat no proposition as sacred and no objection as impious; to be willing to entertain unpopular ideas and cultivate the habits of an open mind \xe2\x80\x94 this is what I was encouraged to do by my teachers at the University of Chicago.'
p8310
aS'It\xe2\x80\x99s what used to be called a liberal education.'

aS'You need to grant your adversary moral respect; give him the intellectual benefit of doubt; have sympathy for his motives and participate empathically with his line of reasoning.'
p8325
aS'And you need to allow for the possibility that you might yet be persuaded of what he has to say.'
p8326
aS'"The Closing of the American Mind" took its place in the tradition of these quarrels.'
p8327
aS'Since the 1960s it had been the vogue in American universities to treat the so-called "Dead White European Males" of the Western canon as agents of social and political oppression.'
p8328
aS'Allan Bloom insisted that, to the contrary, they were the best possible instruments of spiritual liberation.'
p8329
aS'He also insisted that to sustain liberal democracy you needed liberally educated people.'
p8330
aS'This, at least, should not have been controversial.'
p8331
aS'For free societies to function, the idea of open-mindedness can\xe2\x80\x99t simply be a catchphrase or a dogma.'
p8332
aS'It needs to be a personal habit, most of all when it comes to preserving an open mind toward those with whom we disagree.'
p8333
aS'* * * That habit was no longer being exercised much 30 years ago.'
p8334
aS'And if you\xe2\x80\x99ve followed the news from American campuses in recent years, things have become a lot worse.'
p8335
aS'According to a   from the Brookings Institution, a plurality of college students today \xe2\x80\x94 fully 44 percent \xe2\x80\x94 do not believe the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution protects so-called "hate speech," when of course it absolutely does.'
p8336
aS'More shockingly, a narrow majority of students \xe2\x80\x94 51 percent \xe2\x80\x94 think it is "acceptable" for a student group to shout down a speaker with whom they disagree.'
p8337
aS'An astonishing 20 percent also agree that it\xe2\x80\x99s acceptable to use violence to prevent a speaker from speaking.'
p8338
aS'These attitudes are being made plain nearly every week on one college campus or another.'
p8339
aS'There are speakers being shouted down by organized claques of hecklers \xe2\x80\x94 such was the experience of Israeli ambassador   at the University of California, Irvine.'
p8340
aS'Or speakers who require hundreds of thousands of dollars of security measures in order to appear on campus \xe2\x80\x94 such was the experience of conservative pundit   earlier this month at Berkeley.'
p8341
aS'Or speakers who are physically barred from reaching the auditorium \xe2\x80\x94 that\xe2\x80\x99s what happened to   at Claremont McKenna College in April.'
p8342
aS'Or teachers who are humiliated by their students and hounded from their positions for allegedly hurting students\xe2\x80\x99 feelings \xe2\x80\x94 that\xe2\x80\x99s what happened to Erika and Nicholas Christakis of Yale.'
p8343
aS'And there is violence.'
p8344
aS'Listen to a description from Middlebury College professor   of what happened when she moderated a conversation with the libertarian scholar Charles Murray in March: Middlebury is one of the most prestigious liberal-arts colleges in the United States, with an acceptance rate of just 16 percent and tuition fees of nearly $50,000 a year.'
p8345
aS'How does an elite institution become a factory for junior totalitarians, so full of their own certitudes that they could indulge their taste for bullying and violence?'
p8346
aS'There\xe2\x80\x99s no one answer.'
p8347
aS'What\xe2\x80\x99s clear is that the mis-education begins early.'
p8348
aS'I was raised on the old-fashioned view that sticks and stones could break my bones but words would never hurt me.'
p8349
aS'But today there\xe2\x80\x99s a belief that since words can cause stress, and stress can have physiological effects, stressful words are tantamount to a form of violence.'
p8350
aS'This is the age of protected feelings purchased at the cost of permanent infantilization.'
p8351
aS'The mis-education continues in grade school.'
p8352
aS'As the Brookings findings indicate, younger Americans seem to have no grasp of what our First Amendment says, much less of the kind of speech it protects.'
p8353
aS'This is a testimony to the collapse of civics education in the United States, creating the conditions that make young people uniquely susceptible to demagogy of the left- or right-wing varieties.'
p8354
aS'Then we get to college, where the dominant mode of politics is identity politics, and in which the primary test of an argument isn\xe2\x80\x99t the quality of the thinking but the cultural, racial, or sexual standing of the person making it.'
p8355
aS'This is the baroque way Americans often speak these days.'
p8356
aS'It is a way of replacing individual thought \xe2\x80\x94 with all the effort that actual thinking requires \xe2\x80\x94 with social identification \xe2\x80\x94 with all the attitude that attitudinizing requires.'
p8357
aS'In recent years, identity politics have become the moated castles from which we safeguard our feelings from hurt and our opinions from challenge.'
p8358
aS'It is our "safe space".'
p8359
aS'But it is a safe space of a uniquely pernicious kind \xe2\x80\x94 a safe space   thought, rather than a safe space   thought, to borrow a line I recently heard from Salman Rushdie.'
p8360
aS'Another consequence of identity politics is that it has made the distance between making an argument and causing offense terrifyingly short.'
p8361
aS'Any argument that can be cast as insensitive or offensive to a given group of people isn\xe2\x80\x99t treated as being merely wrong.'
p8362
aS'Instead it is seen as immoral, and therefore unworthy of discussion or rebuttal.'
p8363
aS'The result is that the disagreements we need to have \xe2\x80\x94 and to have vigorously \xe2\x80\x94 are banished from the public square before they\xe2\x80\x99re settled.'
p8364
aS'People who might otherwise join a conversation to see where it might lead them choose instead to shrink from it, lest they say the "wrong" thing and be accused of some kind of political -ism or -phobia.'
p8365
aS'For fear of causing offense, they forego the opportunity to be persuaded.'
p8366
aS'Take the arguments over same-sex marriage, which you are now debating in Australia.'
p8367
aS'My own views in favor of same-sex marriage are well known, and I hope the Yes\xe2\x80\x99s wins by a convincing margin.'
p8368
aS'But if I had to guess, I suspect the No\xe2\x80\x99s will exceed whatever they are currently polling.'
p8369
aS'That\xe2\x80\x99s because the case for same-sex marriage is too often advanced not by reason, but merely by branding every opponent of it as a "bigot" \xe2\x80\x94 just because they are sticking to an opinion that was shared across the entire political spectrum only a few years ago.'
p8370
aS'Few people like outing themselves as someone\xe2\x80\x99s idea of a bigot, so they keep their opinions to themselves even when speaking to pollsters.'
p8371
aS'That\xe2\x80\x99s just what happened last year in the Brexit vote and the U.S. presidential election, and look where we are now.'
p8372
aS'If you want to make a winning argument for same-sex marriage, particularly against conservative opponents, make it on a conservative foundation: As a matter of individual freedom, and as an avenue toward moral responsibility and social respectability.'
p8373
aS'The No\xe2\x80\x99s will have a hard time arguing with that.'
p8374
aS'But if you call them morons and Neanderthals, all you\xe2\x80\x99ll get in return is their middle finger or their clenched fist.'
p8375
aS'One final point about identity politics: It\xe2\x80\x99s a game at which two can play.'
p8376
aS'In the United States, the so-called "alt-right" justifies its white-identity politics in terms that are coyly borrowed from the progressive left.'
p8377
aS'One of the more dismaying features of last year\xe2\x80\x99s election was the extent to which "white working class" became a catchall identity for people whose travails we were supposed to pity but whose habits or beliefs we were not supposed to criticize.'
p8378
aS'The result was to give the Trump base a moral pass it did little to earn.'
p8379
aS'* * * So here\xe2\x80\x99s where we stand: Intelligent disagreement is the lifeblood of any thriving society.'
p8380
aS'Yet we in the United States are raising a younger generation who have never been taught either the how or the why of disagreement, and who seem to think that free speech is a one-way right: Namely, their right to disinvite, shout down or abuse anyone they dislike, lest they run the risk of listening to that person \xe2\x80\x94 or even allowing someone else to listen.'
p8381
aS'The results are evident in the parlous state of our universities, and the frayed edges of our democracies.'
p8382
aS'Can we do better?'
p8383
aS'This is supposed to be a lecture on the media, and I\xe2\x80\x99d like to conclude this talk with a word about the role that editors and especially publishers can play in ways that might improve the state of public discussion rather than just reflect and accelerate its decline.'
p8384
aS'I began this talk by noting that Americans have rarely disagreed so vehemently about so much.'
p8385
aS'On second thought, this isn\xe2\x80\x99t the whole truth.'
p8386
aS'Yes, we disagree constantly.'
p8387
aS'But what makes our disagreements so toxic is that we refuse to make eye contact with our opponents, or try to see things as they might, or find some middle ground.'
p8388
aS'Instead, we fight each other from the safe distance of our separate islands of ideology and identity and listen intently to echoes of ourselves.'
p8389
aS'We take exaggerated and histrionic offense to whatever is said about us.'
p8390
aS'We banish entire lines of thought and attempt to excommunicate all manner of people \xe2\x80\x94 your humble speaker included \xe2\x80\x94 without giving them so much as a cursory hearing.'
p8391
aS'The crucial prerequisite of intelligent disagreement \xe2\x80\x94 namely: shut up; listen up; pause and reconsider; and only then speak \xe2\x80\x94 is absent.'
p8392
aS'Perhaps the reason for this is that we have few obvious models for disagreeing well, and those we do have \xe2\x80\x94 such as the Intelligence Squared debates in New York and London or Fareed Zakaria\xe2\x80\x99s show on CNN \xe2\x80\x94 cater to a sliver of elite tastes, like classical music.'
p8393
aS'Fox News and other partisan networks have demonstrated that the quickest route to huge profitability is to serve up a steady diet of high-carb, low-protein populist pap.'
p8394
aS'Reasoned disagreement of the kind that could serve democracy well fails the market test.'
p8395
aS'Those of us who otherwise believe in the virtues of unfettered capitalism should bear that fact in mind.'
p8396
aS'I do not believe the answer, at least in the U.S., lies in heavier investment in publicly sponsored television along the lines of the BBC.'
p8397
aS'It too, suffers, from its own form of ideological conformism and journalistic groupthink, immunized from criticism due to its indifference to competition.'
p8398
aS'Nor do I believe the answer lies in a return to what in America used to be called the "Fairness Doctrine," mandating equal time for different points of view.'
p8399
aS'Free speech must ultimately be free, whether or not it\xe2\x80\x99s fair.'
p8400
aS'But I do think there\xe2\x80\x99s such a thing as private ownership in the public interest, and of fiduciary duties not only to shareholders but also to citizens.'
p8401
aS'Journalism is not just any other business, like trucking or food services.'
p8402
aS'Nations can have lousy food and exemplary government, as Great Britain demonstrated for most of the last century.'
p8403
aS'They can also have great food and lousy government, as France has always demonstrated.'
p8404
aS'But no country can have good government, or a healthy public square, without high-quality journalism \xe2\x80\x94 journalism that can distinguish a fact from a belief and again from an opinion; that understands that the purpose of opinion isn\xe2\x80\x99t to depart from facts but to use them as a bridge to a larger idea called "truth"; and that appreciates that truth is a large enough destination that, like Manhattan, it can be reached by many bridges of radically different designs.'
p8405
aS'In other words, journalism that is grounded in facts while abounding in disagreements.'
p8406
aS'I believe it is still possible \xe2\x80\x94 and all the more necessary \xe2\x80\x94 for journalism to perform these functions, especially as the other institutions that were meant to do so have fallen short.'
p8407
aS'But that requires proprietors and publishers who understand that their role ought not to be to push a party line, or be a slave to Google hits and Facebook ads, or provide a titillating kind of news entertainment, or help out a president or prime minister who they favor or who\xe2\x80\x99s in trouble.'
p8408
aS'Their role is to clarify the terms of debate by championing aggressive and objective news reporting, and improve the quality of debate with commentary that opens minds and challenges assumptions rather than merely confirming them.'
p8409
aS'This is journalism in defense of liberalism, not liberal in the left-wing American or right-wing Australian sense, but liberal in its belief that the individual is more than just an identity, and that free men and women do not need to be protected from discomfiting ideas and unpopular arguments.'
p8410
aS'More than ever, they need to be exposed to them, so that we may revive the arts of disagreement that are the best foundation of intelligent democratic life.'
p8411
aS'The honor the Lowy Institute does tonight\xe2\x80\x99s nominees is an important step in that direction.'
p8412
aS'What they have uncovered, for the rest of you to debate, is the only way by which our democracies can remain rational, reasonable, and free.'
p8413
aS'During my senior year of college, I spent many evenings in fraternity houses.'
p8414
aS'I didn\xe2\x80\x99t show up, like most did, to drink too much and dance badly.'
p8415
aS'Instead, I was the ultimate buzz kill: As a rape crisis counselor, I was there to talk to fellow young men about how to end sexual assault on campus.'
p8416
aS'The University of Pennsylvania mandated sexual violence prevention workshops for members of the Greek organizations on campus, so it was no surprise that many of the fraternity brothers treated my presentation like one of their most boring lectures.'
p8417
aS'Those who didn\xe2\x80\x99t pretend that I was invisible typically eyed me with apprehension as I began my talks.'
p8418
aS'Why did I keep going back?'
p8419
aS'Because despite the yawns, skepticism and class clown behavior I initially encountered, I was reminded with each session that many of the students in the room didn\xe2\x80\x99t have the basic education about rape that I was there to offer.'
p8420
aS'Often, they were truly curious about what constituted sexual assault.'
p8421
aS'They may have at times been surprised or even incredulous to learn about the legal contours of rape and the definition of consent \xe2\x80\x94 but the point is, they learned.'
p8422
aS'And I like to believe that at least a few of them behaved differently as a result.'
p8423
aS'I thought about these young men while listening to Education Secretary  at George Mason University.'
p8424
aS'She criticized the Obama administration\xe2\x80\x99s approach to handling campus sexual assault, including its suggestion in a 2011   that schools use a "preponderance of evidence" standard \xe2\x80\x94 the same one used for other student discipline matters and in civil trials, but looser than the one used in the criminal justice system \xe2\x80\x94 in evaluating sexual assault cases.'
p8425
aS'She argued, despite courts\xe2\x80\x99 rulings to the contrary, that this deprived students accused of rape of their due process rights.'
p8426
aS'Even as she acknowledged the crisis of campus sexual violence, she gave equal if not more weight in her remarks to the plight of the accused, saying, "One rape is one too many. One assault is one too many," but quickly adding, "One person denied due process is one too many".'
p8427
aS'On Friday, Ms. DeVos officially   the Obama administration\xe2\x80\x99s guidance and provided  interim instructions for how colleges should investigate sexual assault.'
p8428
aS'If Ms. DeVos had been in my shoes, looking into the eyes of those fraternity brothers in my workshops, she\xe2\x80\x99d know that one young man who doesn\xe2\x80\x99t understand sexual assault is too many.'
p8429
aS'She\xe2\x80\x99d focus not only on what happens after accusations, but also on the education that is needed to stop sexual violence.'
p8430
aS'Let me be clear: Ignorance is never an excuse for rape.'
p8431
aS'Men, who make up a vast majority of assailants for victims of all genders, are responsible for the violence they enact.'
p8432
aS'That\xe2\x80\x99s true even if they genuinely believe, thanks to messaging from pop culture and even our president, that they have the right to do whatever they want to women\xe2\x80\x99s bodies.'
p8433
aS'But education can help.'
p8434
aS'If college-age men across the country are anything like those I spoke to, many of them have no idea that a woman cannot give legal consent if she\xe2\x80\x99s incapacitated by alcohol or drugs.'
p8435
aS'Many of them haven\xe2\x80\x99t been told that a woman who says yes early in a sexual encounter can still say no later.'
p8436
aS'They don\xe2\x80\x99t understand that a woman\xe2\x80\x99s clothing or her sexual past is irrelevant to whether she agrees to have sex.'
p8437
aS'They don\xe2\x80\x99t know that a woman isn\xe2\x80\x99t required to physically fight them off to communicate that she\xe2\x80\x99s not interested.'
p8438
aS'Resentful as some students in the workshops I facilitated may have been about attending my sessions, I feel confident that a vast majority of them did not want to be rapists.'
p8439
aS'But they, and many of their male peers I spoke to individually, literally didn\xe2\x80\x99t know what rape was.'
p8440
aS'More than 20 years later, a lot of college students  .'
p8441
aS'There\xe2\x80\x99s a legitimate debate to be had about how campus sexual assaults are best adjudicated.'
p8442
aS'But the kind of approach Ms. DeVos and her supporters bring to the issue of college rape \xe2\x80\x94 demanding criminal-like procedures for investigating and disciplining sexual assault while giving short shrift to education and prevention \xe2\x80\x94 does no favors to any students.'
p8443
aS'Instead, my experience taught me that we need to be proactive in preventing sexual assault, and much of that involves something that should be a natural fit for college campuses: education.'
p8444
aS'The workshops I taught to captive audiences of fraternity brothers are a start, but even they weren\xe2\x80\x99t enough.'
p8445
aS'Rape prevention education should be more than an hour, and it should be mandatory for everyone, not just those involved in Greek life.'
p8446
aS'And beyond the legal landscape of sexual assault, men should be disabused of the beliefs that lead to it and should be required to understand its effects on victims.'
p8447
aS'However the information is conveyed, anyone who truly believes one rape is one too many should demand that college students receive it.'
p8448
aS'It\xe2\x80\x99s not hard not to rape.'
p8449
aS'A vast majority of men prove that.'
p8450
aS'But I know firsthand that students arrive on campus having absorbed harmful messages about gender, sex and respect \xe2\x80\x94 messages that lead to assault.'
p8451
aS'To stop violence, schools must teach them something new.'
p8452
aS'I believe that they\xe2\x80\x99re willing to learn.'
p8453
aS'Brazil is home to   of uncontacted indigenous communities of any country in the world.'
p8454
aS'Hidden deep in primeval Amazon forests, these groups represent the final frontier of a seemingly inexorable conquest that began with the landing of Portuguese and Spanish navigators on South America\xe2\x80\x99s shores at the start of the 16th century.'
p8455
aS'The history of Brazil\xe2\x80\x99s Amazon region, as elsewhere in the Americas, abounds with tales of mass death and brutality perpetrated against its native inhabitants.'
p8456
aS'Entire tribes disappeared, many without a trace.'
p8457
aS'Few of these atrocities figured in official accounts; rarely was anyone brought to justice.'
p8458
aS'But 30 years ago, Brazil took an extraordinary step toward halting the march of this dismal history.'
p8459
aS'It recognized the right of its indigenous people to pursue their traditional ways of life, including remaining apart from modern society.'
p8460
aS'It also recognized that they require intact, pristine forests and rivers to survive as they have since before the arrival of Europeans.'
p8461
aS'To that end, the government created a special unit inside Funai, its indigenous affairs agency.'
p8462
aS'The unit was charged with protecting those untrammeled lands and ensuring the viability of the indigenous communities living within them.'
p8463
aS'Field agents who previously sought to woo uncontacted tribes from the bush were assigned a new role: to identify the forests where such tribes live and staff outposts to block intrusions that could threaten the well-being of the native populations.'
p8464
aS'The rights of these tribes \xe2\x80\x94 and the government\xe2\x80\x99s duty to safeguard them \xe2\x80\x94 were enshrined in statutes, international agreements and the country\xe2\x80\x99s 1988 Constitution, which remains the law of the land, at least on paper.'
p8465
aS'But Brazil is rapidly backpedaling on these commitments.'
p8466
aS'Severe budget cuts to Funai and the forced retirement of its most seasoned backwoods officials have caused the withdrawal of personnel and the closing of nearly one-third of the control posts that guard access to the territories of isolated tribes across the Amazon.'
p8467
aS'And now Brazilian officials are   believed to have taken place in August on a riverbank deep in the Amazon rain forest.'
p8468
aS'The tribe that suffered this latest atrocity is known as the flecheiros \xe2\x80\x94 or Arrow People \xe2\x80\x94 a seldom-glimpsed group of hunter-gatherers living in extreme isolation inside the Javari Valley indigenous land, one of a dozen reserves in the Amazon that are home to uncontacted indigenous populations.'
p8469
aS'I am one of few outsiders to see the flecheiros, albeit fleetingly.'
p8470
aS'I trekked through their land on a 10-week expedition through the far reaches of the Javari Valley with Funai in 2002.'
p8471
aS'Officials and indigenous scouts were on a mission to protect the flecheiros, collecting information from their abandoned campsites and monitoring possible threats to their territory, while seeking to avoid direct contact with them.'
p8472
aS'Many of these isolated groups splintered off from larger, now-settled communities, and their cultures are familiar to anthropologists and other experts.'
p8473
aS'But the flecheiros have remained so isolated that we do not know what their ethnicity is, what language they speak or what they call themselves.'
p8474
aS'We do know that they are deft archers who have retreated into one of the Amazon\xe2\x80\x99s most inaccessible redoubts, from which they shun all contact with the outside world.'
p8475
aS'This latest incident goes a long way toward explaining their choice.'
p8476
aS'It\xe2\x80\x99s also the clearest signal yet that Brazil\xe2\x80\x99s failure to uphold its constitutional obligations carries with it lethal consequences.'
p8477
aS'The Javari Valley indigenous land has been a secure bastion for the flecheiros and 15 other isolated tribal groups by dint of its rugged topography and the policies put in place to protect them.'
p8478
aS'Until now.'
p8479
aS'The government outpost on the Jandiatuba River, where the massacre is reported to have occurred, was shut down in 2014 because of budget cuts.'
p8480
aS'Since then, alluvial gold dredges, largely manned by itinerant desperados, have penetrated deep upriver.'
p8481
aS'Some of the prospectors also venture out to hunt bushmeat, and it was such a hunting party that came upon the flecheiros.'
p8482
aS'The miners\xe2\x80\x99 reaction apparently was swift and definitive.'
p8483
aS'Had the checkpoint on the Jandiatuba River remained in operation, it\xe2\x80\x99s likely this terrible encounter could have been avoided.'
p8484
aS'There would be no gold dredges ransacking the Jandiatuba, one of the principal watersheds that sustain the flecheiros, nor hunters stalking game deep in their forests.'
p8485
aS'As we hiked through the primal homeland of the flecheiros 15 years ago, we found ample evidence that Brazil\xe2\x80\x99s policies were working as intended: towering trees dripping with lianas, crystal-clear streams teeming with fish, an astonishing abundance of birds and wild animals, as well as a profound sense of security the flecheiros must have been enjoying.'
p8486
aS'This strategy was the idea of Sydney Possuelo, then a high-ranking Funai official and veteran of dozens of similar treks through the Brazilian jungles.'
p8487
aS'It was Mr. Possuelo, in league with a number of his colleagues, who steered Brazil toward a policy that stands at the confluence of human rights and environmental preservation.'
p8488
aS'"In protecting the Indians," Mr. Possuelo told me as he led our expedition by map and compass, "you\xe2\x80\x99re also protecting vast areas of biodiversity".'
p8489
aS'These policies have made Brazil a shining example for other countries with isolated tribal societies.'
p8490
aS'Now Brazil stands at a crossroads.'
p8491
aS'It can continue its slow strangulation of Funai, or it can enforce its own laws and reclaim its stature as guardian of its rich cultural and biological diversity.'
p8492
aS'It would be the world\xe2\x80\x99s shame \xe2\x80\x94 and Brazil\xe2\x80\x99s in particular \xe2\x80\x94 to stand by and watch, or pretend not to see, as the forces of short-term gain wipe the last human vestiges of pre-European America off the face of the earth.'
p8493
aS'A semi-vanquished enemy is rising zombielike from the crypt of America\xe2\x80\x99s dimly remembered wars.'
p8494
aS'North Korea is gleefully shooting missiles over Japan and splashing them into the Pacific Ocean.'
p8495
aS'With astounding technical felicity, it is building a weapons system that may soon be able to hoist hydrogen bombs into Los Angeles, Chicago or even Manhattan.'
p8496
aS'Meanwhile, two neophyte leaders with strange hair and thin skins are insulting each other in bizarre ways.'
p8497
aS'President Trump called Kim Jong-un "Rocket Man" and threatens to "totally destroy North Korea".'
p8498
aS'Mr. Kim called Mr. Trump " " and threatens to "definitely tame" him with "fire".'
p8499
aS'One of them, at least, should know better.'
p8500
aS'With a quiver of nuclear-tipped intercontinental missiles, the North Korean leader seems to have a good shot at doing what his father and grandfather did \xe2\x80\x94 living despotically to a ripe old age and dying from natural causes.'
p8501
aS'Yet deep in his dictatorial DNA, Kim Jong-un surely knows the risk of provoking a full-scale war with the United States.'
p8502
aS'It did not go well for his family the last time around.'
p8503
aS'During the Korean War (1950-53), his grandfather \xe2\x80\x94 Great Leader Kim Il-sung \xe2\x80\x94 cowered in bunkers as American bombs flattened his cities and legions of his people died.'
p8504
aS'What this should teach American policy makers \xe2\x80\x94 especially our history-challenged president and his blood-and-soil backers \xe2\x80\x94 is that a North Korean offensive strike is unlikely.'
p8505
aS'That is, unless the Kim regime is provoked, perhaps by a particularly warmongering early-morning tweet, into believing that its existence really is at risk.'
p8506
aS'The Trump administration needs to keep Kim family history in mind.'
p8507
aS'It is a criminal enterprise focused on long-term survival, far more adept at enslaving its people than fighting big-boy wars.'
p8508
aS'Sadly, the United States has largely forgotten the lessons of the Korean War, even though that conflict cost the lives of more than 33,000 American combatants.'
p8509
aS'The causes of this collective amnesia are varied: The Korean War ended in an inglorious tie that was impossible to celebrate.'
p8510
aS'It produced no Greatest Generation myths and few memorable movies.'
p8511
aS'Then came Vietnam \xe2\x80\x94 the first war to be truly televised, a war that is still being parsed on public television.'
p8512
aS'Vietnam seared itself into our literary and cinematic culture, blotting out Korea, the Forgotten War.'
p8513
aS'As global anxiety mounts, remedial history is in order.'
p8514
aS'In the summer of 1950, when North Korea started the Korean War with Soviet backing, Kim Il-sung was just 38 years old \xe2\x80\x94 a willful, pugnacious, wet-behind-the-ears dictator, not unlike his grandson today.'
p8515
aS'In secret meetings with Stalin before the invasion, Kim delivered wildly enthusiastic and laughably wrongheaded analyses of how the war would unfold when his army stormed into South Korea.'
p8516
aS'He predicted that a formidable pro-Communist guerrilla force would spontaneously rise up in the South to fight with the North Korean military.'
p8517
aS'It did not.'
p8518
aS'He promised that the South Korean people would rally round his leadership.'
p8519
aS'They did not.'
p8520
aS'To top off his dubious claims, Kim assured Stalin that a North Korean victory would come in three days and the Americans would not intervene.'
p8521
aS'The war has never ended; Americans still patrol the DMZ.'
p8522
aS'At his dacha outside Moscow, Stalin didn\xe2\x80\x99t completely buy what Kim was trying to sell.'
p8523
aS'He warned his eager Korean acolyte, "If you should get kicked in the teeth, I shall not lift a finger".'
p8524
aS'But the old Soviet boss wanted to torment the United States.'
p8525
aS'So, he approved and supplied the invasion, while ordering Kim Il-sung to make it look as if South Korea had started the war.'
p8526
aS'The United States, of course, did fight back.'
p8527
aS'President Harry S. Truman, Congress and the public were outraged by the invasion, interpreting it as a challenge to America\xe2\x80\x99s character.'
p8528
aS'In less than a week, Truman approved the use of ground forces.'
p8529
aS'After a halting and discouraging start that cost the lives of thousands of G.I.s, the American war machine became a murderous, unstoppable force.'
p8530
aS'Using bombs and napalm, the United States Air Force blew up and burned down virtually every population center in North Korea.'
p8531
aS'Gen. Curtis LeMay, head of the Strategic Air Command during the Korean War, estimated that "over a period of three years or so, we killed off \xe2\x80\x94 what \xe2\x80\x94 20 percent of the population".'
p8532
aS'That\xe2\x80\x99s about 1.9 million people.'
p8533
aS'American troops \xe2\x80\x94 fighting with South Korean and United Nations forces \xe2\x80\x94 shredded North Korea\xe2\x80\x99s invading army, occupied Pyongyang, and marched north to the Chinese border, effectively erasing North Korea.'
p8534
aS'Mao Zedong then stepped in, unwilling to tolerate American soldiers on his doorstep.'
p8535
aS'Mao\xe2\x80\x99s top general, Peng Dehuai, quickly sized up Kim Il-sung as a battlefield nincompoop.'
p8536
aS'Calling his leadership "extremely childish," Peng elbowed Kim out of the chain of command and made him a helpless spectator to his own war.'
p8537
aS'Vast numbers of Chinese troops died to save North Korea from Kim\xe2\x80\x99s bloody mistake; they kept his regime from becoming a footnote in Asian history.'
p8538
aS'Propagandists in Pyongyang have always lied to the North Korean people about this well-documented history, claiming that South Korea and the United States stealthily started the war and the Great Leader brilliantly won it.'
p8539
aS'But his descendants and their military planners know better.'
p8540
aS'For all its Orwellian blather, the Kim family dictatorship has survived this long by being coldly rational, even as it projects wild-eyed belligerence.'
p8541
aS'If war were to come again, the regime must reckon that it is much less likely to get significant support from the countries that were the Communist mother ships of the mid-20th century.'
p8542
aS'Vladimir Putin\xe2\x80\x99s Russia is a gangster shadow of Stalin\xe2\x80\x99s Soviet Union.'
p8543
aS'China\xe2\x80\x99s political stability depends on vibrant trade with the West.'
p8544
aS'What\xe2\x80\x99s more, Kim Jong-un \xe2\x80\x94 with the timing of his nuclear tests and missile-launching antics \xe2\x80\x94 has gone out of his way to antagonize the Chinese president, Xi Jinping.'
p8545
aS'North Korea, as a result, is more isolated than ever \xe2\x80\x94 even as it becomes a global nuclear threat.'
p8546
aS'The United States has to accept the obvious: Kim Jong-un is never going to give up his missiles.'
p8547
aS'But he knows that if he uses them, he\xe2\x80\x99s going to die or live in a bunker like Granddad.'
p8548
aS'His nuclear hardware is most valuable on the shelf.'
p8549
aS'Mr. Trump should holster his "fire and fury" and cease uttering what Kim Jong-un accurately describes as "unprecedented rude nonsense".'
p8550
aS'Instead, Washington needs to settle in for an extended cold war with the Kims: strong military preparedness, energetic spying, flexible sanctions, quiet negotiations with China and Russia, and openness to conversations at whatever level is possible with North Koreans.'
p8551
aS'It would help if Washington made unilateral gestures.'
p8552
aS'Accept a North Korean ambassador in Washington.'
p8553
aS'If possible, send an ambassador to Pyongyang.'
p8554
aS'Acknowledge the heinous bombing of cities in the Korean War.'
p8555
aS'Try to help the North Korean people feel as if the world is not against them.'
p8556
aS'War could still come and the United States would be lax if it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t ready.'
p8557
aS'The maturity of Kim Jong-un is questionable.'
p8558
aS'Dazzled by the beauty of his weapons, he could try to use them to take control of the entire Korean Peninsula.'
p8559
aS'But his family\xe2\x80\x99s shattering history of wartime overreach suggests he knows better.'
p8560
aS'What does it take to advertise on Facebook to people who openly call themselves "Jew haters" and want to know "how to burn Jews"?'
p8561
aS'About $10 and 15 minutes, according to what the investigative nonprofit ProPublica recently uncovered.'
p8562
aS'After much outcry over this revelation, Facebook\xe2\x80\x99s chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg,  the anti-Semitic ad targeting "a fail on our part," promised to put more human reviewers in place, and said the company "never intended or anticipated this functionality being used this way \xe2\x80\x94 and that is on us".'
p8563
aS'Some of Facebook\xe2\x80\x99s users may find it even harder to accept what happened.'
p8564
aS'How could the site that we use to keep in touch with friends and family, share baby pictures, and keep up with politics and volunteer work be made so easily to cater to the interests of Nazis?'
p8565
aS'But anyone who understands how Facebook works shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have been surprised.'
p8566
aS'That\xe2\x80\x99s because the same digital platform that offers us social interaction, news, entertainment and shopping all in one place makes its money by making it cheap and easy to send us commercial or political messages, often guided by algorithms.'
p8567
aS'The recent scandal is just a reminder.'
p8568
aS'Almost every feature on Facebook is designed to make the site engaging \xe2\x80\x94 to encourage you to spend time there while Facebook serves more ads to you.'
p8569
aS'At the same time, users can share "promoted posts" \xe2\x80\x94 targeted messages that advertisers pay Facebook to place in their feeds \xe2\x80\x94 merging pay-for-play content with the natural flow of information among friends and family.'
p8570
aS'It\xe2\x80\x99s a powerful combination.'
p8571
aS'People who use the platform to keep in touch with loved ones may forget that the site makes its money by serving as a conduit for whatever messages people with money want to push at us.'
p8572
aS'You\xe2\x80\x99ll rarely hear the company\xe2\x80\x99s chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, mention that when he offers lofty statements about how his company makes the world more open and connected and brings us closer together.'
p8573
aS'While it does help us communicate and stay in touch, it also does much more: Facebook has become the go-to site for anyone hoping to reach a big audience \xe2\x80\x94 whether to sell shoes or to sell politics, and it\xe2\x80\x99s become profitable by doing so.'
p8574
aS'That is because most of its systems are either largely or entirely automated.'
p8575
aS'This lets the site scale up \xe2\x80\x94 it is up to two billion monthly users now \xe2\x80\x94 and keeps costs down.'
p8576
aS'Facebook also saves money through community policing, relying heavily on its users to do the legwork of flagging inappropriate content.'
p8577
aS'Policies are enforced unevenly.'
p8578
aS'For example, many people use Facebook pseudonyms, which violate the site\xe2\x80\x99s "real names only" policy.'
p8579
aS'But whether such users see their accounts suspended often depends on whether they\xe2\x80\x99re reported by other users.'
p8580
aS'This means those using pseudonyms to protect their identities while posting about human rights violations in repressive regimes and are flagged by members of those regimes may face consequences for breaking the rule, while others go unnoticed.'
p8581
aS'Human employees are expensive, and algorithms are cheap.'
p8582
aS'Facebook directly employs only about 20,658 people \xe2\x80\x94 roughly one employee per 100,000 users.'
p8583
aS'With so little human oversight and so much automation, public relations crisis like the one that surrounded the ads for hate groups are inevitable.'
p8584
aS'So why do billions of us still use Facebook?'
p8585
aS'Because everyone else is already there.'
p8586
aS'Economists call this a "network effect" \xe2\x80\x94 there are products that are hard to compete with once they capture an substantial audience.'
p8587
aS'Facebook also uses its enormous cash pile to gobble up competitors or to copy their features, and has already hoarded giant amounts of data that provide it with ad-targeting advantages that would-be competitors cannot easily replicate.'
p8588
aS'It\xe2\x80\x99s a combination that leaves it without effective competition.'
p8589
aS'This, combined with deep surveillance-based profiling, enormous scale, automation, lack of sufficient human oversight and a tendency to react to public relations crises instead of making proactive changes helps to explain why, during the 2016 presidential race, the site was swamped with misinformation and outright fraudulent fake news, with actors ranging from foreign troublemakers to make-a-buck hucksters to ideologically motivated political groups.'
p8590
aS'Here\xe2\x80\x99s the hard truth: All these problems are structural.'
p8591
aS'Facebook is approaching half-a-trillion dollars in market capitalization because the business model \xe2\x80\x94 ad-targeting through deep surveillance, emaciated work force, automation and the use of algorithms to find and highlight content that entice people to stay on the site or click on ads or share pay-for-play messages \xe2\x80\x94 works.'
p8592
aS'The trouble is Facebook\xe2\x80\x99s business model is structurally identical whether advertisers are selling shoes, politics or fake diet pills, and whether they\xe2\x80\x99re going after new moms, dog lovers or neo-Nazis.'
p8593
aS'The algorithms don\xe2\x80\x99t know the difference, and Facebook\xe2\x80\x99s customers are not its users.'
p8594
aS'Rather, as this latest incident should remind us, we are Facebook\xe2\x80\x99s product.'
p8595
aS'Our attention and eyeballs are sold to the highest bidders, whatever they may be peddling.'
p8596
aS'I do not know how to drive.'
p8597
aS'My middle sister, Kerri, learned to drive a few years ago.'
p8598
aS'We are both well into adulthood, but I still rely on her and our oldest sister, Kirsten, for any sort of transportation outside of New York City.'
p8599
aS'So this summer, when we took a road trip, with our mother and Kirsten\xe2\x80\x99s husband and two children, to women\xe2\x80\x99s history sites, I found myself in the slightly disempowering back seat while on a search for empowerment.'
p8600
aS'It was a road trip to answer the following question: What does the rallying cry of sisterhood and the concept of feminism mean when last year, the majority of white, female voters chose whiteness as a political identity over womanhood?'
p8601
aS'What does feminism mean to each of us, as black women, when we had just lived through an election season of hearing candidates and commentators use that old, unexamined phrase, "women and black people," skipping over our existence as both?'
p8602
aS'How do we understand women\xe2\x80\x99s history as triumphant when we are still smarting from the very public smackdown of a woman attempting to reach the highest seat of power?'
p8603
aS'My sisters were the perfect people with whom to seek some answers.'
p8604
aS'I idolized my sister Kerri growing up.'
p8605
aS'I still do.'
p8606
aS'When she was a teenager and I was still in middle school, she wore high-rise short shorts and tube tops, the living embodiment of the song "Shoop," strutting down the halls of our super-white prep school.'
p8607
aS'She also played cello, loved Pushkin and read and wrote obsessively.'
p8608
aS'She was that thing that too much of America fears and ridicules \xe2\x80\x94 the loud, black teenage girl.'
p8609
aS'And now she\xe2\x80\x99s an academic, bumping vintage D\xe2\x80\x99Angelo in her hybrid car as she pulls into her university parking space.'
p8610
aS'I did not need critical race theory or third-wave feminism to tell me about the myth of the Jezebel.'
p8611
aS'I had Kerri.'
p8612
aS'My sister Kirsten taught me the importance of work for women.'
p8613
aS'There is the seductive, unobtainable fantasy of "A Room of One\xe2\x80\x99s Own," and then there is the reality of the life of a working mother and artist \xe2\x80\x94 revising your work and responding to students and drafting grant applications from the front seat of your car while your kids are in dance practice.'
p8614
aS'I watched her live the life of a playwright-mother, and seeing her do it gave me the courage to try for a similar life myself.'
p8615
aS'My sisters taught me how to be a feminist.'
p8616
aS'They taught me in their contradictions, in the fact that they contain multitudes.'
p8617
aS'My family is black in Northeastern America, which means our economic and social success was dependent on fleeing as far away from predominantly black neighborhoods and schools as possible.'
p8618
aS'So my upwardly mobile parents moved us to a predominantly white neighborhood and I always went to predominantly white schools.'
p8619
aS'My best friend was the little white girl who lived next door.'
p8620
aS'Her mother loves to tell this story: After playing at our house, she begged her mother for a Barbie.'
p8621
aS'On Christmas morning, my best friend opened her present and burst into tears.'
p8622
aS'"This is not Barbie"!'
p8623
aS'she sobbed.'
p8624
aS'She held up the white, blond Barbie in its box.'
p8625
aS'She has black curly hair!'
p8626
aS'"Barbie has brown skin! This is not the Barbie at Kaitlyn\xe2\x80\x99s house"!'
p8627
aS'Black womanhood was always centered in our home, so I didn\xe2\x80\x99t look at white women with envy because they were white.'
p8628
aS'And I was rarely instinctively suspicious of them.'
p8629
aS'Like most black and brown people in this country, despite what white people may believe, I was not actively looking for the ways whites slighted me because I was black.'
p8630
aS'Especially when you live and work in predominantly white spaces, you have to hold on to the social fiction that white people are responding to you as an individual.'
p8631
aS'If you do not hold on to that lie, or at least use it judiciously, you risk going mad with grief and anger.'
p8632
aS'But since the election, that has changed.'
p8633
aS'The art historian Moyo Okediji notes that in Yoruban concepts of history, the community must assure children that they are not physically alone and "that a series of road maps exists, made by great and talented ancestors who as individuals have beaten a track for succeeding generations".'
p8634
aS'That is why history is a comfort to me, in times of doubt.'
p8635
aS'And this is, of course, why the past is a battleground.'
p8636
aS'Why we fight about statues, and which system of oppression should be enshrined in bronze to be remembered or torn down to be recorded differently.'
p8637
aS'I have seen, first hand, how understanding history can change people\xe2\x80\x99s present-day attitudes.'
p8638
aS'A decade ago, in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, I led a group of black high school students on a tour of the Hunterfly Road Houses.'
p8639
aS'I told them the story of black self-determination and liberation in 19th-century Brooklyn.'
p8640
aS'By the end, these students literally broke into song \xe2\x80\x94 a spontaneous rendition about freedom and joy and black excellence.'
p8641
aS'It was one of the most profound moments of my life.'
p8642
aS'Whenever anyone insists that the past doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter, that we should get over it, I think of those students, dancing on a lawn in central Brooklyn on a school-day afternoon, stepping to the rhythm of the names of black abolitionists.'
p8643
aS'This July, my sisters and I were chasing something like that feeling.'
p8644
aS'We wanted to find women who could remind us that another, more tolerant, hopeful way of being is possible.'
p8645
aS'It was possible 150 years ago, during a time when people supposedly didn\xe2\x80\x99t know any better \xe2\x80\x94 and we hoped that perspective would help us in this present time, when people supposedly do.'
p8646
aS'My sisters selected the following women to lead us on our tour: Prudence Crandall, Sarah Harris, Belinda Sutton and Ellen Garrison.'
p8647
aS'Our first stop is the Prudence Crandall Museum, a wide, Federalist-style building in Canterbury, Conn.'
p8648
aS'In 1831, Crandall, a young white woman, opened a school in the building for the daughters of the wealthy white families in town.'
p8649
aS'It was a success.'
p8650
aS'The next year, Sarah Harris, a 20-year-old black woman, wrote to Crandall.'
p8651
aS'Harris hoped to eventually open a school for black children in Connecticut.'
p8652
aS'She wrote: "Miss Crandall, I want to get a little more learning, if possible, enough to teach colored children and if you will admit me to your school, I shall forever be under greatest obligation to you. If you think it will be the means of injuring you, I will not insist on the favor".'
p8653
aS'I think about this letter, the carefulness of the words.'
p8654
aS'It\xe2\x80\x99s a tone that I recognize, that I think most people who have ever worked under oppression recognize.'
p8655
aS'It is the tone you adopt when you are unsure if the person you are talking to has the ability to see you as a fellow human.'
p8656
aS'Crandall admitted Harris, and the white parents pressured her to expel Harris.'
p8657
aS'Crandall refused, and parents removed their daughters.'
p8658
aS'In response, Crandall doubled down on her commitment to educating black women.'
p8659
aS'She reached out to black communities and to the white abolitionist William Lloyd Garrison to recruit more black female students.'
p8660
aS'The surrounding white community attacked the school and attempted to burn it down.'
p8661
aS'Connecticut passed a law that made it illegal to educate African-Americans who were not already state residents.'
p8662
aS'The museum has a section dedicated to the stories of the women who studied there.'
p8663
aS'Students returned to their states and started schools of their own for black people, started black newspapers and antislavery newspapers, and opened their homes to activists.'
p8664
aS'Kerri, history nerd that she is, recognizes all the names on the wall as though they are old friends.'
p8665
aS'Our next stop on the tour was the   and Slave Quarters, in Medford, Mass., home of the only standing slave quarters north of the Mason-Dixon line.'
p8666
aS'The Royalls were the largest slaveholding family in Massachusetts, making their money from the enslaved people who worked their plantations in the Caribbean.'
p8667
aS'The family used the fortune earned from enslaved labor to found Harvard Law School.'
p8668
aS'My sisters chose this stop because of Belinda Sutton, a woman the Royall family enslaved.'
p8669
aS'By her own account, she was born in Africa, kidnapped at around 12 and sold to the Royall plantation in Antigua.'
p8670
aS'She was enslaved into her old age.'
p8671
aS'When the family patriarch, Isaac Royall Jr., died, his will gave her the choice of freedom or enslavement.'
p8672
aS'Sutton, even at her advanced age, chose the unknown of freedom.'
p8673
aS'She was promised an annuity, which she successfully sued the Royall family for \xe2\x80\x94 twice.'
p8674
aS'Kirsten has been writing a play about Belinda Sutton for the past few years.'
p8675
aS'Standing in the stately home, Penny Outlaw, a co-president of the museum, reminded us that Isaac Royall Jr. opposed the American Revolution.'
p8676
aS'Yet, she told us on the tour, the American government compensated him fully for seizing his property during the war.'
p8677
aS'Sutton got three years\xe2\x80\x99 worth of compensation for more than 60 years of stolen labor, she said.'
p8678
aS'Unlike some other plantations, the Royall House museum emphasizes what the enslaved people there would have experienced.'
p8679
aS'In the main house, we are shown the slaves\xe2\x80\x99 staircase.'
p8680
aS'It\xe2\x80\x99s a winding staircase with only one or two windows and very little light.'
p8681
aS'There\xe2\x80\x99s no banister, the stairs are steep, and the walls would have been painted black, so that the handprints of the enslaved men and women using the stairs remained invisible.'
p8682
aS'"Can you imagine," Ms. Outlaw said, "going up and down these stairs on a winter night, in the dark"?'
p8683
aS'Our final stop, on the Fourth of July, was the Robbins House, in Concord, Mass.'
p8684
aS'The house now sits directly across the street from the North Bridge, on the site where the first successful battle of the Revolutionary War was fought.'
p8685
aS'The   was part of the farm that the patriarch of the family, Caesar Robbins, a previously enslaved man and a Revolutionary War veteran, was invited to live on.'
p8686
aS'The house, on the outskirts of Concord, was then far from the white residents.'
p8687
aS'A generation later, Thoreau would reference some of Robbins\xe2\x80\x99s descendants in his journals.'
p8688
aS'But to me, the most remarkable descendant was Ellen Garrison, born in the homestead in 1823.'
p8689
aS'As a young woman, she and her mother were deeply involved in the antislavery movement, and she signed petitions protesting the federal government\xe2\x80\x99s treatment of the Cherokee and calling for states to repeal the death penalty.'
p8690
aS'After the Civil War, she immediately signed up to teach in schools established by the Freedmen\xe2\x80\x99s Bureau.'
p8691
aS'There, she was required to fill out forms assessing the intelligence of the newly freed slaves \xe2\x80\x94 on every one, report after report, she firmly wrote that they were "equal" to white men.'
p8692
aS'But Garrison is most remarkable for testing the limits of the federal Civil Rights Act of 1866, legislation that would have ushered in an equal society if white lawmakers had not given up on enforcing it.'
p8693
aS'One month after it was enacted, and 89 years ahead of Rosa Parks, Ellen Garrison challenged the segregated public transportation in Maryland.'
p8694
aS'She refused to move from a ladies waiting lounge and was forcibly ejected.'
p8695
aS'Garrison sued, and a Maryland grand jury dismissed the suit in July 1866.'
p8696
aS'After touring the house, my sisters and I sat on the green, while all around us, people paraded, dressed in the costumes of colonists who believed in freedom with conditions \xe2\x80\x94 not necessarily for women, not necessarily for black people and certainly not for black women.'
p8697
aS'I think about the foresight and sheer leaps of intelligence it took for Crandall, for Harris, for Sutton and Garrison, to imagine a world that most around them could not imagine.'
p8698
aS'It is a world I have to keep telling myself we are almost in sight of, if we keep thinking and planning and plotting as they did.'
p8699
aS'Plastic bags are often used for a few minutes before enjoying an eternal afterlife, clogging storm drains, stuffing landfills, killing animals that eat them and contributing to the   of plastic that end up in the world\xe2\x80\x99s oceans every year.'
p8700
aS'Last month, Kenya took strong action to tackle the scourge.'
p8701
aS'Manufacturers and importers of   of $19,000 to $38,000 or four-year-jail terms.'
p8702
aS'Retailers can no longer sell plastic garbage bags.'
p8703
aS'Shoppers risk having plastic bags confiscated.'
p8704
aS'The ban imposes more difficulties on many Kenyans than just the inconvenience of getting reusable bags.'
p8705
aS'Poor residents of Nairobi rely on plastic bags as "flying toilets" in the absence of a functioning sewage system and of public toilets that don\xe2\x80\x99t charge a fee.'
p8706

aS"In the corridors and break rooms of Equifax Inc.'s giant Atlanta headquarters, employees used to joke that their enormously successful credit reporting company was just one hack away from bankruptcy."
p9108
aS"They weren't being disparaging, just darkly honest: Founded in the 19th century as a retail credit company, Equifax had over the years morphed into one of the largest repositories of Americans' most sensitive financial data, which the company sliced and diced and sold to banks and hedge funds."
p9109
aS'In short, the viability of Equifax and the security of its data were one and the same.'
p9110
aS'Nike Zheng, a Chinese cybersecurity researcher from a bustling industrial center near Shanghai, probably knew little about Equifax or the value of the data pulsing through its servers when he exposed a flaw in popular backend software for web applications called Apache Struts.'
p9111
aS'Information he provided to Apache, which published it along with a fix on March\xc2\xa06, showed how the flaw could be used to steal data from any company using the software.'
p9112
aS"The average American had no reason to notice Apache's post but it caught the attention of the global hacking community."
p9113
aS'Within 24 hours, the information was posted to FreeBuf.com, a Chinese security website, and showed up the same day in Metasploit, a popular free hacking tool.'
p9114
aS'On March 10, hackers scanning the internet for computer systems vulnerable to the attack got a hit on an Equifax server in Atlanta, according to people familiar with the investigation.'
p9115
aS'Before long, hackers had penetrated Equifax.'
p9116
aS'They may not have immediately grasped the value of their discovery, but, as the attack escalated over the following months, that first group\xe2\x80\x94known as an entry crew\xe2\x80\x94handed off to a more sophisticated team of hackers.'
p9117
aS'They homed in on a bounty of staggering scale: the financial data\xe2\x80\x94Social Security numbers, birth dates, addresses and more\xe2\x80\x94of\xc2\xa0at least 143 million Americans.'
p9118
aS"By the time they were done, the attackers had accessed dozens of sensitive databases and created more than 30 separate entry points into Equifax's computer systems."
p9119
aS'The hackers were finally discovered on July 29, but were so deeply embedded that the company was forced to take a\xc2\xa0consumer complaint portal offline for 11 days while the security team found and closed the backdoors the intruders had set up.'
p9120
aS'The handoff to more sophisticated hackers is among the evidence that led some investigators inside Equifax to suspect a nation-state was behind the hack.'
p9121
aS'\xc2\xa0Many of the tools used were Chinese, and these people say the Equifax breach has the hallmarks of similar intrusions in recent years at giant health insurer Anthem Inc.\xc2\xa0and the U.S. Office of Personnel Management; both were ultimately attributed to hackers working for Chinese intelligence.'
p9122
aS"Others involved in the investigation aren't so sure, saying the evidence is inconclusive at best or points in other directions."
p9123
aS"One person briefed on the probe being conducted by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and U.S. intelligence agencies said that there is evidence that a nation-state may have played a role, but that it doesn't point to China."
p9124
aS'The person declined to name the country involved because the details are classified.'
p9125
aS"Mandiant, the security consulting firm hired by Equifax to investigate the breach, said in a report distributed to Equifax clients on Sept. 19 that it didn't have enough data to identify either the attackers or their country of origin."
p9126
aS"Wherever the digital trail ultimately leads, one thing is clear: The scant details about the breach so far released by Equifax\xe2\x80\x94besides angering millions of Americans\xe2\x80\x94omit some of the most important elements of the intrusion and what the company has since learned about the hackers' tactics and motives."
p9127
aS'Bloomberg has reconstructed the chain of events through interviews with more than a dozen people familiar with twin probes being conducted by Equifax and U.S. law enforcement.'
p9128
aS"In one of the most telling revelations, Equifax and Mandiant got into a dispute just as the hackers were gaining a foothold in the company's network."
p9129
aS"\xc2\xa0That rift, which appears to have squelched a broader look at weaknesses in the company's security posture, looks to have given the intruders room to operate freely within the company's network for months."
p9130
aS"According to an internal analysis of the attack, the hackers had time to customize their tools to more efficiently exploit Equifax's software, and to query and analyze dozens of databases to decide which held the most valuable data."
p9131
aS"The trove they collected was so large it had to be broken up into smaller pieces to try to avoid tripping alarms as data slipped from the company's grasp through the summer."
p9132
aS'In an e-mailed statement, an Equifax spokesperson said: "We have had a professional, highly valuable relationship with Mandiant. We have no comment on the Mandiant investigation at this time".'
p9133
aS'The massive breach occurred even though Equifax had invested millions in sophisticated security measures, ran a dedicated operations center and deployed a suite of expensive anti-intrusion software.'
p9134
aS'The effectiveness of that armory appears to have been compromised by poor implementation and the departure of key personnel in recent years.'
p9135
aS"But the company's challenges may go still deeper."
p9136
aS'One U.S. government official said leads being pursued by investigators include the possibility that the hackers had help from someone inside the company.'
p9137
aS'"We have no evidence of malicious inside activity," the Equifax spokesperson said.'
p9138
aS'\xc2\xa0"We understand that law enforcement has an ongoing investigation".'
p9139
aS'The nature of the attack makes it harder to pin on particular perpetrators than either the Anthem or OPM hacks, said four people briefed on the probe.'
p9140
aS'The attackers avoided\xc2\xa0using\xc2\xa0tools that investigators\xc2\xa0can use to fingerprint known groups.'
p9141
aS'One of the tools used by the hackers\xe2\x80\x94China Chopper\xe2\x80\x94has a Chinese-language interface, but is also in use outside China, people familiar with the malware said.'
p9142
aS'The impact of the Equifax breach will echo for years.'
p9143
aS'Millions of consumers will\xc2\xa0live with the worry that the hackers\xe2\x80\x94either criminals or spies\xe2\x80\x94hold the keys to their financial identity, and could use them to do serious harm.'
p9144
aS'The ramifications for Equifax and the larger credit reporting industry could be equally severe.'
p9145
aS'The crisis has already claimed the scalp of Richard Smith, the chief executive officer.'
p9146
aS'Meanwhile, the federal government has launched several probes, and the company has been hit with a flurry of lawsuits.'
p9147
aS'"I think Equifax is going to pay or settle for an amount that has a \'b\' in it," says Erik Gordon, a University of Michigan business professor.'
p9148
aS'When Smith became Equifax CEO in 2005, the former General Electric Co. executive was underwhelmed by what he found.'
p9149
aS'In a speech at the University of Georgia last month, he described a stagnating credit reporting agency with a "culture of tenure" and "average talent".'
p9150
aS'However, Smith also saw enormous potential because Equifax inhabited a uniquely lucrative niche in the modern global economy.'
p9151
aS'In the speech, Smith explained that the company gets its data for free (because regular consumers hand it over to the banks when they apply for credit).'
p9152
aS'Then, he said, the company crunches the data with the help of computer scientists and artificial intelligence and sells it back to the banks\xc2\xa0that gave Equifax the data in the first place.'
p9153
aS'The business generates a gross margin of about 90 percent.'
p9154
aS'"That\'s a pretty unique model," Smith said.'
p9155
aS'And one that he fully exploited.'
p9156
aS'Smith acquired two dozen companies that have given Equifax new ways to package and sell data, while expanding operations to 25 countries and 10,000 employees.'
p9157
aS'Business was good\xe2\x80\x94the company\xe2\x80\x99s stock price quadrupled under Smith\xe2\x80\x99s watch, before the breach was announced\xe2\x80\x94and its leaders lived well.'
p9158
aS'Equifax executives were prone to bragging about their mansions and expensive gadgets.'
p9159
aS'They took lavish trips to Miami, where they stayed in luxury hotels costing as much as $1,000 a night.'
p9160
aS"Last year, Smith's compensation was almost $15 million."
p9161
aS"But the man who transformed Equifax was plagued each and every day by the fear that hackers would penetrate the company's firewall and make off with the personal data of millions of people."
p9162
aS"By the time he gave the speech on Aug.\xc2\xa017, Smith knew of the hack but the public didn't."
p9163
aS'He told the audience the risk of a breach\xc2\xa0was "my No. 1 worry" and lingered on the threats posed by spies and state-sponsored hackers.'
p9164
aS"\xc2\xa0Not long after becoming CEO, he hired Tony Spinelli, a well-regarded cyber expert, to overhaul the company's security."
p9165
aS'The new team rehearsed breach scenarios, which involved 24-hour crisis-management squads taking turns to address each given issue until it was resolved.'
p9166
aS'Protocol included alerting the chief of security, who determined the severity of the breach, and then telling the executive leadership if a threat was considered serious.'
p9167
aS'Apparently, gaps remained.'
p9168
aS'After the breach became public in September, Steve VanWieren, a vice president of data quality who left Equifax in January 2012 after almost 15 years, wrote in a\xc2\xa0post\xc2\xa0on LinkedIn that "it bothered me how much access just about any employee had to the personally identifiable attributes. I would see printed credit files sitting near shredders, and I would hear people speaking about specific cases, speaking aloud consumer\xe2\x80\x99s personally identifiable information".'
p9169
aS'Spinelli left in 2013, followed less than a year later by his top deputy, Nick Nedostup.'
p9170
aS'Many rank and file followed them out the door, and key positions were filled by people who were not well-known in the clubby cybersecurity industry.'
p9171
aS'The company hired Susan Mauldin, a former security chief at First Data Corp., to run the global security team.'
p9172
aS'Mauldin introduced herself to colleagues as a card-carrying member of the National Rifle Association, according to a person familiar with the changes.'
p9173
aS'\xc2\xa0Two people who worked with Mauldin at Equifax say she seemed to be putting the right programs in place, or trying to.'
p9174
aS'"Internally, security was viewed as a bottleneck,"\xc2\xa0one person said.'
p9175
aS'"There was a lot of pressure to get things done. Anything related to IT was supposed to go through security".'
p9176
aS'Mauldin couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be reached for comment.'
p9177
aS'The company continued to invest heavily in state-of-the-art technology, and had a dedicated team to quickly patch vulnerabilities like the one identified by Zheng.'
p9178
aS'Overseeing technology for Equifax was David Webb, a Kellogg MBA and Russian-language major hired in 2010 from Silicon Valley Bank, where he had been chief operations officer.'
p9179
aS'\xc2\xa0But one former security leader said he finally joined the talent exodus because it felt like he was working with the "B\xc2\xa0team".'
p9180
aS'\xc2\xa0Lapses in security began to catch up to the company in myriad ways beginning early this year.'
p9181
aS'Since at least Feb. 1, Equifax had been aware that identity thieves were abusing a service that manages payroll data for companies, according to notices sent to victims.'
p9182
aS'Criminals were feeding stolen Social Security numbers and other personal information into login pages for Equifax Workforce Solutions, downloading W-2 and other tax forms for dozens of employees of clients including Northrop Grumman Corp., Whole Foods Market Inc. and Allegis Global Solutions Inc., a human resources company.'
p9183
aS'They accessed the data freely for over a year to file fraudulent tax returns and steal the refunds before Equifax learned of the incidents.'
p9184
aS'(KrebsOnSecurity.com, a cybersecurity blog, first reported the thefts in May.'
p9185
aS")Equifax hired Mandiant in March to investigate any security weaknesses related to the scams, and in notifications mailed to victims throughout the summer, Equifax eventually said its systems weren't breached to acquire the personal data used in the fraud."
p9186
aS'However, there are signs that Smith and others were aware something far more serious was going on.'
p9187
aS'The investigation in March was described internally as "a top-secret project" and one that Smith was overseeing personally, according to one person with direct knowledge of the matter.'
p9188
aS'The relationship with Mandiant broke down sometime over the next several weeks\xe2\x80\x94a period that would later turn out to be critical in how the breach unfolded.'
p9189
aS'Mandiant warned Equifax that its unpatched systems and misconfigured security policies could indicate major problems, a person familiar with the perspectives of both sides said.'
p9190
aS'For its part, Equifax believed Mandiant had sent an undertrained team without the expertise it expected from a marquee security company.'
p9191
aS'A Mandiant spokesman declined to comment on the March investigation.'
p9192
aS'Although the hackers inside Equifax were able to evade detection for months, once the hack was discovered on July 29, investigators quickly reconstructed their movements down to the individual commands they used.'
p9193
aS"The company's suite of tools included Moloch, which works much like a black box after an airliner crash by\xc2\xa0keeping a record of a network's internal communications and data traffic."
p9194
aS'Using Moloch, investigators\xc2\xa0reconstructed\xc2\xa0every step.'
p9195
aS'Once the hackers found the vulnerability Zheng reported, they installed a simple backdoor known as a web shell.'
p9196
aS"It didn't matter if Equifax fixed the vulnerability after that."
p9197
aS"The hackers had an invisible portal into the company's network."
p9198
aS'The Moloch data\xc2\xa0suggests the initial group of hackers struggled to jump through internal roadblocks like firewalls and security policies, but that changed once the advanced team took over.'
p9199
aS"Those intruders used special tunneling tools to slide around firewalls, analyzing and cracking one database after the next\xe2\x80\x94while stockpiling data on the company's own storage systems."
p9200
aS'Besides amassing data on nearly every American adult, the hackers also sought information on specific people.'
p9201
aS"It's not clear exactly why, but there are at least two possibilities: They were looking for high-net-worth individuals\xc2\xa0to defraud, or they wanted the financial details of people with potential intelligence value."
p9202
aS'Eventually the intruders installed more than 30 web shells, each on a different web address, so they could continue operating in case some were discovered.'
p9203
aS'\xc2\xa0Groups known to exploit web shells most effectively include teams with links to Chinese intelligence, including one nicknamed Shell Crew.'
p9204
aS'Some investigators within Equifax reached the conclusion that they were facing Chinese state hackers relatively quickly after analyzing the Moloch data, according to a person briefed on those discussions.'
p9205
aS'If the Equifax breach was a purely criminal act, one would expect at least some of the stolen data, especially the credit card numbers that were taken, to have showed up for sale on the black market.'
p9206
aS'That hasn\xe2\x80\x99t happened.'
p9207
aS'What\xe2\x80\x99s more, banks are typically asked to shut down all stolen cards if investigators are near certain who is behind a hack.'
p9208
aS'In this case, they still aren\xe2\x80\x99t sure.'
p9209
aS'That\xe2\x80\x99s why on Sept. 11, the FBI asked several major banks to monitor the credit card accounts of small batches of consumers\xe2\x80\x94in one case just 20 people\xe2\x80\x94for suspicious activity.'
p9210
aS'Investigators were still looking for anything that could give them insight into the hackers\' identity and motives, according to security experts". This wasn\'t a credit card play," said one person familiar with the investigation.'
p9211
aS'"This was a \'get as much data as you can on every American\xe2\x80\x99 play".'
p9212
aS'But it probably won\xe2\x80\x99t be known if state hackers\xe2\x80\x94from China or another country\xe2\x80\x94were involved until U.S. intelligence agencies and law enforcement complete their work.'

aS'In the past few years, Puerto Ricans like me across the United States have come together to support our families still on the island, and to demand an end to the cuts that have made life harder and harder for our parents, our brothers and sisters.'
p9262
aS'We will send help to them and our communities, but we must also defend them in the States, by resisting any measures from Washington that will make matters worse.'
p9263
aS'As the president of a union that represents thousands of Puerto Ricans along the East Coast \xe2\x80\x94 from Boston to New York to Florida \xe2\x80\x94 I will push our congressional representatives to extend the moratorium on the debt service and create a comprehensive plan to get the island back on its feet.'
p9264

p9266
aS'As I await news from my family, I think about the long road back to normality ahead of us.'

p9270
aS'I\xe2\x80\x99m in a comfortable seat, and I\xe2\x80\x99m looking forward to getting back to my family.'
p9271
aS'About 12 hours ago, though, I was miserable, locked in a holding cell by Malaysia\xe2\x80\x99s "religious police".'
p9272
aS'The story began a few months ago, when the  , a reformist, progressive Muslim organization in Malaysia, invited me to give a series of lectures on Islam, reason and freedom.'
p9273
aS'The group had hosted me three times before in the past five years for similar events and also published the Malay version of my book "Islam Without Extremes: A Muslim Case for Liberty".'
p9274
aS'I was glad for the chance to visit Malaysia again.'
p9275
aS'I arrived in Kuala Lumpur on Sept. 22.'
p9276
aS'The next day I gave my   on the suppression of rational theology by dogmatists in early Islam, making the point that this "intellectual suicide" still haunts Muslim civilization.'
p9277
aS'The second talk was on a more controversial topic: apostasy from Islam.'
p9278
aS'I   that Muslims must uphold freedom of conscience, in line with the Quranic dictum "No compulsion in religion".'
p9279
aS'I said that apostasy should not be punished by death, as it is in Saudi Arabia, or with "rehabilitation," as it is in Malaysia.'
p9280
aS'The practice of Islam must be on the basis of freedom, not coercion, and governments shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t police religion or morality.'
p9281
aS'It turns out all you have to do is speak of the police and they will appear.'
p9282
aS'At the end of my talk, a group of serious-looking men came into the lecture hall and showed me badges indicating that they were "religion enforcement officers".'
p9283
aS'"We heard that you just gave an unauthorized talk on religion," one of the men said.'
p9284
aS'"And we got complaints about it".'
p9285
aS'They took me to another room, photographed me and asked questions about my speech.'
p9286
aS'When they were done with their questioning, they handed me a piece of paper with Malay writing on it and told me that I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t speak again without proper authorization.'
p9287
aS'They also warned me away from my next planned talk, which was going to be about my most recent book, "The Islamic Jesus: How the King of the Jews Became a Prophet of the Muslims".'
p9288
aS'"We heard that you will speak about commonalities between Islam, Judaism and Christianity," one officer said.'
p9289
aS'"We don\xe2\x80\x99t like that kind of stuff".'
p9290
aS'Then they left.'
p9291
aS'After all this, I consulted with my hosts, and we decided to cancel the final lecture.'
p9292
aS'I assumed that was the end of the matter and went shopping for gifts for my wife and children.'
p9293
aS'Later in the day, I went to the Kuala Lumpur International Airport to begin the 30-hour trip back to Massachusetts.'
p9294
aS'When I gave my passport to the border police, I realized that my experience with offending Malaysia\xe2\x80\x99s Islamic sensibilities wasn\xe2\x80\x99t over.'
p9295
aS'"You need to wait, sir," said the woman who checked my passport.'
p9296
aS'She called some police officers, who called other police officers, who took me to a room where my arrest order was read to me.'
p9297
aS'Apparently the religious police, known as  , wanted to interrogate me again for my "unauthorized" talk on religious freedom and had issued that arrest order to make sure I didn\xe2\x80\x99t leave the country.'
p9298
aS'I was taken from the airport to a police station, then to another station.'
p9299
aS'Finally, I was taken to the JAWI headquarters, where I was locked up.'
p9300
aS'To be fair, nobody was rude to me, let alone cruel.'
p9301
aS'Still, I was distressed: I had been arrested in an alien country whose laws and language I did not understand.'
p9302
aS'I had no idea what would happen to me \xe2\x80\x94 and, most painfully, when I would see my wife, Riada, our 2-year-old son, Levent, and our 2-month-old baby, Efe.'
p9303
aS'In the morning, I was taken to a Shariah court, which is used in Malaysia to adjudicate religious issues, where I was interrogated for two hours.'
p9304
aS'At the end, to my surprise, I was let go.'
p9305
aS'Soon I learned that this was greatly facilitated by the diplomatic efforts of my country, Turkey \xe2\x80\x94 and especially the contact made by a former Turkish president, Abdullah Gul, with Malaysian royalty.'
p9306
aS'This incident showed me once again that there is a major problem in Islam today: a passion to impose religion, rather than merely proposing it, a mind-set that most Christians left behind at the time of the Inquisition.'
p9307
aS'Luckily, there are antidotes within Islam to this problem.'
p9308
aS'One of them is the Quranic verse that the JAWI officers repeatedly chided me for daring to recite: "No compulsion in religion".'
p9309
aS'In fact, mainstream Muslim tradition, reflecting its illiberal context, never fully appreciated the freedom implied by this verse \xe2\x80\x94 and other ones with similar messages.'
p9310
aS'"The \xe2\x80\x98no compulsion\xe2\x80\x99 verse was a problem to the earliest exegetes," as Patricia Crone, a scholar of Islamic history, has  .'
p9311
aS'"And they reacted by interpreting it restrictively".'
p9312
aS'The verse was declared "abrogated," or its scope was radically limited.'
p9313
aS'This is still evident in a parenthetical that is too frequently inserted into translations of the verse.'
p9314
aS'"There shall be no compulsion in religion ( )".'
p9315
aS'I\xe2\x80\x99d known that Saudi translations added those extra words at the end.'
p9316
aS'Now I have learned that the   do, too.'
p9317
aS'They append the extra phrase because while they agree with the Quran that no one should be forced to become a Muslim, they think that Muslims should be compelled to practice the religion \xe2\x80\x94 in the way that the authorities define.'
p9318
aS'They also believe that if Muslims decide to abandon their religion, they must be punished for "apostasy".'
p9319
aS'One of the officers at my Malaysian Shariah court trial proudly told me that all of this was being done to "protect religion".'
p9320
aS'But I have an important message for her (which I didn\xe2\x80\x99t share at the time): By policing religion, the authorities are not really protecting it.'
p9321
aS'They are only enfeebling their societies, raising hypocrites and causing many people to lose their faith in or respect for Islam.'
p9322
aS'I came to understand that while I was being held in the JAWI headquarters, listening to a loud Quranic recitation coming from the next room.'
p9323
aS'I heard the Quran and for the first time in my life it sounded like the voice of an oppressor.'
p9324
aS'But I did not give in to that impression.'
p9325
aS'"I hear you and I trust in you, God," I said as I prayed, "despite these bigots who act in your name".'
p9326
aS'I believe Valerie Plame, the former C.I.A. operative and fading liberal celebrity, when she says she missed the anti-Semitic "undercurrents" in an article she called "provocative, but thoughtful".'
p9327
aS'I believe her when she says she "zeroed in on the neocon criticism" but missed the article\xe2\x80\x99s more prejudicial elements.'
p9328
aS'The article was titled   It uses variants of the word "Jew" 22 times.'
p9329
aS'The word "neocons" appears only twice.'
p9330
aS'I believe Plame is telling the truth when she says the subtlety was lost on her.'
p9331
aS'I believed Donald Trump when he insisted last year there was nothing amiss with him tweeting the image of a six-pointed star superimposed over a pile of $100 bills alongside a picture of Hillary Clinton and the caption "Most corrupt candidate ever"!'
p9332
aS'I believe him when he said it was a  , not a Star of David.'
p9333
aS'I did not believe white supremacist David Duke when he said there was "no way" it was a sheriff\xe2\x80\x99s star.'
p9334
aS'What does David Duke know about dog whistles anyway?'
p9335
aS'I believe the national council of the American Studies Association was taking an "ethical stance" when it voted unanimously in 2013 for an academic boycott of Israeli institutions.'
p9336
aS'I find nothing askance in the association never previously boycotting the institutions of any other country.'
p9337
aS'I believe the group\xe2\x80\x99s then-president, Curtis Marez, made a valid   that Israel was targeted because "one has to start somewhere".'
p9338
aS'I believe the A.S.A. will one day get around to boycotting the academic institutions of China for its occupation of Tibet, or of Russia for its occupation of Ukraine, or of India for its alleged occupation of Kashmir.'
p9339
aS'I believe there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing discriminatory in singling out the Jewish state for behavior the A.S.A. accepts from other states.'
p9340
aS'I believed then-Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad when he said, at a New York breakfast I attended in 2010, that anti-Semitism is mostly unknown in his country.'
p9341
aS'I believe that the Islamic Republic is welcoming toward its Jews, as evidenced by the one seat it reserves in its Parliament for a Jew.'
p9342
aS'I believe there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing anti-Semitic in   for Israel to be wiped off the map.'
p9343
aS'I believe Iranian leaders are only interested in historical scholarship and artistic freedom when they   for Holocaust deniers or supported Holocaust  .'
p9344
aS'I believe a Jewish community in Iran that has experienced   since the Iranian revolution is happy with its political masters.'
p9345
aS'I believed there was nothing amiss with former Republican Senator Chuck Hagel   in 2006 that "the Jewish lobby intimidates a lot of people" on Capitol Hill.'
p9346
aS'I believe the Jewish lobby must be uniquely intimidating to American lawmakers, unlike, say, the National Rifle Association or the agriculture lobby.'
p9347
aS'I believe Hagel had nothing to apologize for in the remark for which he later apologized during his confirmation process for secretary of defense.'
p9348
aS'I believe Hagel\xe2\x80\x99s apology was sincere.'
p9349
aS'I believe his   for opposing James Hormel\xe2\x80\x99s nomination as Bill Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s ambassador to Luxembourg \xe2\x80\x94 Hagel slammed Hormel as "openly, aggressively gay" \xe2\x80\x94 was also sincere.'
p9350
aS'I believe the thesis of "The Israel Lobby," the 2007 book by Stephen Walt and John Mearsheimer, is a sound one.'
p9351
aS'The idea that a small group of (largely) Jewish-Americans manipulates Congress, the media and other levers of power and influence for the benefit of a malign Jewish state has no connection to previous anti-Semitic conspiracy theories alleging the same thing.'
p9352
aS'I believe that when Jeffrey Goldberg called the book\xe2\x80\x99s ideas "awfully close to the Elders of Z" in a  , his views must be treated as suspect.'
p9353
aS'Who does Goldberg work for, anyway?'
p9354
aS'I believe that when Mel Gibson said, in the course of a DUI arrest, "the Jews are responsible for all the wars in the world," he meant it as a statement of hearty approval.'
p9355
aS'I believe that there is nothing curious in the constant ascription of authorship of the 2003 invasion of Iraq to Paul Wolfowitz and Doug Feith, both second-tier officials in the Bush Administration, and Richard Perle, who oversaw a federal advisory committee with no real power.'
p9356
aS'I believe they were much more influential to the decision-making process than Dick Cheney, Donald Rumsfeld, Condoleezza Rice, Colin Powell or George W. Bush.'
p9357
aS'I believe the fact that Wolfowitz, Feith and Perle happen to be Jewish does not, in any sense, make them convenient villains in that drama.'
p9358
aS'I believe that when left-wing German terrorist Wilfried B\xc3\xb6se insisted, during the 1976 hijacking of an Air France jetliner, "I\xe2\x80\x99m no Nazi! I\xe2\x80\x99m an idealist," he had a point.'
p9359
aS'B\xc3\xb6se and his partner, Brigitte Kuhlmann, separated the passengers between Israelis and non-Israelis, freeing the latter while holding the former hostage at Entebbe airport, Uganda, before their rescue by Israeli troops.'
p9360
aS'I believe that targeting Jews for being Jews is anti-Semitism, but targeting Israelis for being Israelis is a legitimate form of political resistance.'
p9361
aS'I believe anti-Zionism has nothing to do with anti-Semitism.'
p9362
aS'I believe calling for the elimination of the Zionist entity is a morally legitimate idea.'
p9363
aS'Another thing: I believe Valerie Plame when she writes, "Just FYI, I am of Jewish descent".'
p9364
aS'I believe some of her best friends are Jewish.'
p9365
aS'In May 2011, I drove a car in the city of Khobar, Saudi Arabia, to protest the kingdom\xe2\x80\x99s ban on women driving.'
p9366
aS'As a result, I was arrested, taken from my home in the dark of night and jailed for nine days, during which time I was interrogated, strip-searched and accused of being a traitor and a spy.'
p9367
aS'I was released only after my father begged King Abdullah, the ruler at the time, to pardon me.'
p9368
aS'Many people in my country shunned me afterward.'
p9369
aS'Clergymen called for me to be whipped, stoned, even killed.'
p9370
aS'Within a year, I was forced to leave my job.'
p9371
aS'Then, fearing for my safety,   where I had been born and grew up, and where I had begun to raise a family of my own.'
p9372
aS'Women before and after me have also been arrested, lost their jobs and been jailed for the simple act of getting behind the wheel of a car.'
p9373
aS'We protested the ban on driving by women because its effects went far beyond cars and roads.'
p9374
aS'The prohibition meant that we were unable to take our children to school; we could not drive loved ones to a doctor or hospital; we could not commute to a job or go to the grocery store on our own.'
p9375
aS'The ban meant the loss of the most basic form of dignity and control over our lives.'
p9376
aS'This is why for the women of Saudi Arabia, Sept. 26, 2017, the day the monarchy announced that it plans to overturn the driving ban, will be remembered as our Emancipation Day.'
p9377
aS'It is every bit as monumental for us as Aug. 18, 1920, was for American women, the date the 19th Amendment giving them the right to vote was ratified.'
p9378
aS'At last, Saudi women will have freedom of movement \xe2\x80\x94 and their say.'
p9379
aS'Saudi society will never be the same again.'
p9380
aS'From my friends living inside the kingdom, I hear a mixture of disbelief and joy.'
p9381
aS'My email inbox is overflowing with messages of wonder.'
p9382
aS'On my Facebook feed, I see my friends\xe2\x80\x99 excitement.'
p9383
aS'"Finally come true," one friend wrote.'
p9384
aS'Another dreamed bigger: "I hope all the laws would be reformed until we observe full equality between the sexes".'
p9385
aS'American women fought for their basic emancipation during the heyday of the bicycle.'
p9386
aS'The great women\xe2\x80\x99s rights pioneer Susan B. Anthony said that bicycling "has done more to emancipate women than anything else in the world".'
p9387
aS'The bicycle freed 19th-century women from their homes and from their dependence on men.'
p9388
aS'I hope that in Saudi Arabia, the car will do the same.'
p9389
aS'In the Saudi system, women are considered inferior.'
p9390
aS'No matter our age, we have  .'

aS'My mother gave birth to me on the floor of our apartment in Mecca with only my toddler sister to help her because my father was at work and no male guardian was available to take her to a hospital.'
p9393
aS'I am certain that some parts of Saudi society will vehemently oppose women driving.'
p9394
aS'In the last six years, official studies commissioned by the government have declared that women will damage their ovaries from sitting in the driver\xe2\x80\x99s seat and will give birth to children "with clinical problems".'
p9395
aS'In 2011, the year that I drove, an academic report prepared for the Saudi Legislature, the Shura, concluded that allowing women to drive would lead to societal rot, including "pornography, prostitution, homosexuality and divorce".'
p9396
aS'And just last week, a Saudi cleric, warning against women as drivers, claimed that women have only "half the brains of men," adding that the figure drops to one quarter "when they go to market".'
p9397
aS'This language may be shocking until you consider that 100 years ago, American suffragists peacefully asking for the right to vote were arrested, tortured, beaten, force-fed and locked in mental institutions.'
p9398
aS'But they persisted, and they won.'
p9399
aS'Like their American sisters, Saudi women have persisted, too.'
p9400
aS'We Saudi women have been like birds with clipped wings, full of song, but unable to take flight.'
p9401
aS'That will change.'

aS'Now we must become the driving force of our own destinies, able to make our own decisions.'
p9403

aS'We are fully capable of being our own guardians.'
p9405
aS'When I was forced to leave my country and my family, I dreamed of the day when I might return, not in an airplane, but by driving across the border and up through the desert to my home.'
p9406
aS'Today I no longer have to dream.'
p9407
aS'Next June, when the change in policy comes into effect, I plan to make that drive.'

aS'The U.S. House of Representatives on Thursday passed a $1.2 trillion bill to fund most government activities in the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1, knowing the Senate will disagree with many controversial elements and force a negotiation that could stretch into December.'
p9410
aS'The bill, passed by a 211-198 vote largely along party lines in the Republican-controlled House, provides $658.1 billion for the Department of Defense and $44.3 billion for the Department of Homeland Security, including roughly $1.6 billion for construction of physical barriers along the U.S.-Mexican border.'
p9411
aS'The $31.4 billion allotted for the Department of the Interior, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the Forest Service, the Indian Health Service and related agencies cut the EPA\xe2\x80\x99s funding by $534 million when compared to the prior fiscal year.'
p9412
aS'The funding measure also included a provision that would stop the Internal Revenue Service from implementing a provision of the 2010 Affordable Care Act, commonly known as Obamacare, that imposes a tax penalty on individuals who elect to go without health insurance.'
p9413
aS'Representative Kevin McCarthy, a member of Republican leadership, said the funding measure would make "major changes to the way Washington spends taxpayer dollars".'
p9414
aS'"Our funding legislation forces the government to do what it ought to do and to stop doing what it shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t do," McCarthy said in a statement, praising it for "strengthening our national defense, veterans\xe2\x80\x99 programs, and border security," and "cutting abusive Washington agencies like the IRS and the EPA".'
p9415
aS'Democrats warned that the bill, which bundled together 12 separate funding measures and earned just one Democratic vote, would need substantial revision in the Senate, where Republicans hold 52 of 100 seats but most legislation requires 60 votes for passage.'

p9419
aS'Brought to the United States illegally by her parents as a child, Garcia is one of six immigrants who sued the Trump administration on Monday over its decision to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, program.'
p9420
aS'Since it was authorized in 2012 by President Barack Obama, the program has provided protection from deportation and the right to work legally to nearly 800,000 young people.'
p9421
aS'Garcia\xe2\x80\x99s case, filed in San Francisco federal court, is the first to be brought by DACA recipients, known as Dreamers, since U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced earlier this month that the Obama-era policy would start winding down in March 2018, according to Garcia\xe2\x80\x99s lawyers.'
p9422
aS'It is among several lawsuits challenging the decision to end DACA, including two cases brought by state attorneys general.'
p9423
aS'The legal claims in all of the cases, including Garcia\xe2\x80\x98s, are similar: that the Trump administration did not follow proper administrative procedure in rescinding DACA, and that making enforcement promises to a group of people, only to revoke them, violates due process.'
p9424
aS'The Trump administration has said it is ending DACA because Obama overstepped his constitutional authority when he bypassed Congress and created the DACA program unilaterally.'
p9425
aS'President Donald Trump called on Congress to enact a law to protect DACA recipients and last week angered some of his fellow Republicans by negotiating with top congressional Democratic leaders on possible legislation.'

aS'The Republican attacks that accompanied the firing of FBI Director James Comey have sharply intensified in the last two weeks, with broadsides delivered on Twitter, public statements and even from the White House podium.'
p9520
aS'Comey, who in June said President Donald Trump and the White House had lied about him and the law enforcement agency he led, has been repeatedly accused of delivering false testimony, of prematurely exonerating Hillary Clinton for her use of a private email server and of improperly leaking details about his private conversations with the president.'
p9521
aS"The attacks, which come as Congress and federal investigators probe the circumstances of his dismissal, appear clearly designed to undercut the credibility of a veteran lawman whose testimony and vivid first-person accounts loom as central to special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation."
p9522
aS"Though Trump's lawyers over the summer had been mulling ways to undermine the legitimacy of Mueller's investigation, the stepped-up salvos suggest White House officials and Trump's legal team see Comey \xe2\x80\x94 who, despite enjoying broad support from within the FBI, also received bipartisan criticism for his handling of the Clinton probe \xe2\x80\x94 as a more vulnerable target for attack."
p9523
aS'Jay Sekulow, one of Trump\'s lawyers, told The Associated Press this week that he did not consider Comey to be a "credible witness" and that there were multiple reasons for Comey\'s firing.'
p9524
aS"I'm just discussing facts."
p9525
aS'"I\'m not looking at this as a legal strategy. Read Hillary Clinton\'s book," said Sekulow, referring to the newly released post-mortem of last year\'s election that harshly criticizes Comey\'s oversight of the email investigation.'
p9526
aS"But there's also no question that attempts to sully Comey's reputation, and to characterize him as a rogue and ineffective leader, are also aimed at undercutting any potential obstruction of justice allegations arising from the May 9 firing and at planting the idea that the dismissal was the culmination of legitimate performance concerns \xe2\x80\x94 not an effort to railroad the Russia probe."
p9527
aS'"I think there\'s a recognition that if there were to be an obstruction case, the credibility of Jim Comey will be a central issue \xe2\x80\x94 no different than the credibility of a central, critical witness to any other case," said Jacob Frenkel, a Washington defense lawyer who has followed the investigation.'
p9528
aS'"The best time to cast doubt on a witness\' reputation or reliability," he added, "is before any case actually hits the courtroom or Congress in a charging document".'
p9529
aS"The attacks on Comey's performance aren't surprising given the White House's labored, and evolving, efforts to explain the firing."
p9530
aS'Officials initially said Trump was acting on the recommendation of his Justice Department, which produced a scathing assessment of his handling of the Clinton investigation.'
p9531
aS'But that explanation unraveled days later when Trump said he would have fired Comey regardless of recommendation, and was further weakened when it was revealed that Trump and an aide had earlier drafted, but not sent, a letter meant to rationalize the planned dismissal.'
p9532
aS"That draft memo is in Mueller's possession."
p9533
aS'The criticism of Comey began immediately after his firing, when White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders claimed to have personally heard from many unsatisfied FBI agents about low morale at the bureau.'
p9534
aS'But it has escalated in the last two weeks.'
p9535
aS'Sen. Chuck Grassley, the Republican chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, released segments of interviews with FBI officials that show Comey had begun contemplating how to close the Clinton email investigation without charges months before Clinton and other key aides had been interviewed by agents.'

p9537
aS'The following morning, Trump tweeted, "Wow, looks like James Comey exonerated Hillary Clinton long before the investigation was over. A rigged system"!'

aS'This week, Sanders said she thought Comey should be investigated by the Justice Department for disclosing private memos to the media.'
p9539
aS'"James Comey\'s leaking of information, making questionable statements under oath, politicizing an investigation_those are real reasons for why he was fired," Sanders said.'
p9540
aS'Yet no memos were released by Comey.'
p9541
aS'Instead, a friend of Comey shared portions of the notes with reporters and has said none of the material was marked classified.'
p9542
aS'Comey was already gone by the time the existence of the memos was made public, and he has steadfastly denied that politics factored into his decision.'
p9543
aS"Trump's own relationship with Comey had been frayed for months."
p9544
aS'The president has said he was angry when Comey, in a private meeting in January, shared with him details from a dossier of salacious allegations about ties between Russia and the campaign.'
p9545
aS'Comey has said Trump later asked him for a loyalty pledge and to end an investigation into former national security adviser Michael Flynn.'
p9546
aS'The attacks have been galling to current and former FBI agents who were personally and professionally fond of Comey.'
p9547
aS'His reputation for independence was sealed by the revelation that, as deputy attorney general during the George W. Bush administration, he had threatened to resign over the renewal of a domestic surveillance program.'
p9548
aS"Though those same tendencies put him at odds with presidential administrations \xe2\x80\x94 he publicly broke with the Obama White House on race and policing, and aggravated officials by departing from standard protocol during the Clinton investigation \xe2\x80\x94 employee surveys show he maintained abiding support and respect from the FBI's rank-and-file."
p9549
aS'"For us to have to sit through the attacks on his character, his integrity, to see attempts to paint a picture that is completely the opposite of what we knew . it\'s very hard to stomach," said Frank Montoya, a retired FBI supervisor.'
p9550
aS"But that audience isn't necessarily who Sanders is trying to win over."
p9551
aS'"Those who hold Jim Comey in the highest regard for integrity and performance always will do so regardless of public relations positioning," Frenkel said.'
p9552
aS'"These efforts have nothing to do with a message to the FBI or a message to the legal community. This is likely about creating a perception for potential jurors should that ever become an issue".'

aS'Third, it is axiomatic that in a low-turnout election (such as an off-year, September special election), the candidate with the most enthusiastic followers and best existing organization has an edge over a candidate with appeal that, even if it is theoretically broader, is less intense or personal.'
p9731
aS'Operating through local churches and social media, Mr. Moore\xe2\x80\x99s network of dedicated volunteers and supporters was more formidable than anything Mr. McConnell\xe2\x80\x99s money could buy.'

aS'There are a few additional twists, but they\xe2\x80\x99re all bad \xe2\x80\x94 notably, a funding formula that would penalize states that are actually successful in reducing the number of uninsured.'
p9969
aS'Did this bill\xe2\x80\x99s sponsors \xe2\x80\x94 Lindsey Graham, Bill Cassidy, Ron Johnson and Dean Heller \xe2\x80\x94 manage to get through months of health care debate without learning anything about the issue?'
p9970
aS'Maybe.'
p9971
aS'But surely the rest of the Senate, not to mention much of the public, has wised up about false Republican promises.'
p9972
aS'A huge majority of voters, almost two to one, consider it a   that previous attempts at repealing and replacing Obamacare failed.'
p9973
aS'Yet there is a real chance that Graham-Cassidy, which is similar to but even worse than previous Republican proposals, will nonetheless become law, because not enough people are taking it seriously.'
p9974
aS'As in the presidential election, we start from a baseline of extreme tribalism, in which 48 or 49 Republican senators will vote for anything, no matter how awful, that bears their party\xe2\x80\x99s seal of approval.'
p9975
aS'To make a bill the law, its sponsors only need to win one or two more votes.'
p9976
aS'The main reason Republican leaders couldn\xe2\x80\x99t do that on previous health bills was public outrage and activism.'
p9977
aS'Letters and phone calls, demonstrators and crowds at town halls, made it clear that many Americans were aware of the stakes, and that politicians who voted to take health care away from millions would be held accountable.'
p9978
aS'Now, however, the news cycle has moved on, taking public attention with it.'
p9979
aS'Many progressives have already begun taking Obamacare\xe2\x80\x99s achievements for granted, and are moving on from protest against right-wing schemes to dreams of single-payer.'
p9980
aS'Unfortunately, that\xe2\x80\x99s exactly the kind of environment in which swing senators, no longer in the spotlight, might be bribed or bullied into voting for a truly terrible bill.'
p9981
aS'The good news is that for technical reasons of parliamentary procedure, Graham-Cassidy has to pass by the end of this month, or not at all.'
p9982
aS'The bad news is that such passage is a real possibility.'
p9983
aS'So if you care about preserving the huge gains the A.C.A. has brought, make your voice heard.'
p9984
aS'Otherwise we may wake up to another terrible morning after.'
p9985
aS'That was only one in   on Sept. 11 by ESPN host Jemele Hill in which Hill goes on to say that Trump is "the most ignorant, offensive president of my lifetime," that he hired and courted white supremacists, that "His rise is a direct result of white supremacy," that "if he were not white, he never would have been elected".'
p9986
aS'Hill insinuates that the Republican Party "has done nothing but endorse/promote white supremacy".'
p9987
aS'These tweets caused quite a stir.'
p9988
aS'The White House perpetual lie-generator and press secretary,  , said that it was a fireable offense for ESPN.'
p9989
aS'Sanders\xe2\x80\x99s statement, of course, was not without its own controversy.'
p9990
aS'As  : "The Democratic Coalition, an anti-Trump Super PAC, has filed an ethics complaint against White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders with the Office of Government Ethics for her comments calling on ESPN host Jemele Hill to be fired".'
p9991
aS'AOL continued: "The group claims federal law prohibits government employees from influencing \xe2\x80\x98a private entity\xe2\x80\x99s employment \xe2\x80\xa6 solely on the basis of partisan political affiliation. \xe2\x80\x99" Then on Friday, Trump himself weighed in, because obviously there are no more pressing matters that need his attention, oh like, say, North Korea continuing to launch missiles over Japan, for one.'
p9992
aS'People are dumping it in RECORD numbers.'
p9993
aS'Trump tweeted: "ESPN is paying a really big price for its politics (and bad programming). Apologize for untruth"!'
p9994
aS'This tweet, for me, changed the conversation.'
p9995
aS'It moved the discussion from propriety and in-house rules of conduct by a brand, to a question of veracity.'
p9996
aS'Was what Hill said untrue, as Trump\xe2\x80\x99s tweet suggests, or is Trump in fact a white supremacist who has surrounded himself with white supremacists and whose party courted white supremacists?'
p9997
aS'Two of those points can be quickly put to rest.'
p9998
aS'First, there is no question that Trump has hired someone who was at least a booster of white supremacists: Steve Bannon.'
p9999
aS'In a sinister act of double signaling, Bannon was hired as the Trump campaign\xe2\x80\x99s chief executive on the same day that Trump started   to black voters in Milwaukee.'
p10000
aS'Also, while the Republican Party clearly stands for more than white supremacy and the promotion of that intellectually fallacious concept, the party has often turned a blind eye to the racists in its midst and done far too little to extricate them.'
p10001
aS'But then the question remains: Is Trump himself a white supremacist?'
p10002
aS'This question is almost unanswerable in the absolute, but there is mounting circumstantial evidence pointing in a most disquieting direction.'
p10003
aS'First, we must submit that Trump is not particularly discerning in the administration of his insults.'
p10004
aS'As   pointed out in July, "Trump is on track to insult 650 people, places and things on Twitter by the end of his first term".'
p10005
aS'He is often reflexive with his derisions, attacking those who criticize or condemn him.'
p10006
aS'Many of Trump\xe2\x80\x99s lackeys laud his instinct to counterpunch.'
p10007
aS'When Trump attacked MSNBC host Mika Brzezinski,  , "When the president gets hit, he\xe2\x80\x99s going to hit back harder".'
p10008
aS'They paint it as strength, although it is clearly weakness.'
p10009
aS'It is a masking of fragility with aggression.'
p10010
aS'And the traditionally marginalized \xe2\x80\x94 women, racial, religious and ethnic minorities \xe2\x80\x94 are treated to a particularly personal strain of Trump\xe2\x80\x99s venom.'
p10011
aS'In Trump\xe2\x80\x99s eyes, Barack Obama wasn\xe2\x80\x99t simply a bad president, he was illegitimate and inferior, a person who couldn\xe2\x80\x99t possibly be as talented as the world thought he was.'
p10012
aS'He questioned whether Obama had actually attended his prestigious colleges and insisted that Obama\xe2\x80\x99s memoir was   for him to have written it, that it must have been written by a white man.'
p10013
aS'Is Trump patriarchal and misogynistic?'
p10014
aS'Definitely.'
p10015
aS'But, what of white supremacy?'
p10016
aS'It is clear that Trump is hero among white supremacists: He panders to them, he is slow to condemn them and when that condemnation manifests, it is often forced and tepid.'
p10017
aS'Trump never seems to be worried about offending anyone except Vladimir Putin and white supremacists.'
p10018
aS'What does that say about him?'
p10019
aS'How can you take comfort among and make common cause with white supremacists and not assimilate to their sensibilities?'
p10020
aS'I say that it can\xe2\x80\x99t be done.'
p10021
aS'If you are not completely opposed to white supremacy, you are quietly supporting it.'
p10022
aS'If you continue to draw equivalencies between white supremacists and the people who oppose them \xe2\x80\x94 as Trump did   last week \xe2\x80\x94 you have crossed the racial Rubicon and moved beyond quiet support to vocal support.'
p10023
aS'You have made an allegiance and dug a trench in the war of racial hostilities.'
p10024
aS'Hill may have pushed into the realm of hyperbole with a few of her statements \xe2\x80\x94 it was Twitter after all \xe2\x80\x94 but I judge the spirit of her assessment to be true.'
p10025
aS'Either Trump is himself a white supremacist or he is a fan and defender of white supremacists, and I quite honestly am unable to separate the two designations.'
p10026
aS'For Major League Baseball, 2017 has been a season of extremes.'
p10027
aS'The Los Angeles Dodgers went on an extraordinary tear, winning 84 percent of the time during one 67-game stretch.'

aS'Then they pulled a U-ie and lost all but one of their next 17 games.'
p10029
aS'The Cleveland Indians entered the weekend Friday night having triumphed in 22 straight games, an American League record.'
p10030
aS'Much of the baseball world\xe2\x80\x99s attention, though, is on a single player:  , who plays right field for the Miami Marlins.'
p10031
aS'He has been hitting home runs at a pace worthy of Roy Hobbs in "The Natural" \xe2\x80\x94 54 of them going into the weekend.'
p10032
aS'That has put him at the center of intriguing debates among the sport\xe2\x80\x99s devotees.'
p10033
aS'If there\xe2\x80\x99s one thing that die-hard fans love more than baseball, it\xe2\x80\x99s arguing about baseball.'
p10034
aS'The question about Mr. Stanton is what to do should he hit 62 homers, a challenging goal with only two weeks left in the regular season but one nonetheless within sight.'
p10035
aS'He would top an old record of 61 established in 1961 by Roger Maris, who surpassed the 60 that Babe Ruth hit in 1927.'
p10036
aS'Hang on, you may be saying.'
p10037
aS'Isn\xe2\x80\x99t the real record well out of reach \xe2\x80\x94 the 73 homers that Barry Bonds hit in 2001?'
p10038
aS'That is so.'
p10039
aS'But Mr. Bonds has long labored under suspicions that he sailed to his 73 on a tide of performance-enhancing drugs.'
p10040
aS'A similar taint clings to Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa, both of whom also outdid Maris in the steroid-fueled 1990s and early 2000s.'
p10041
aS'So an argument heard in some baseball-watching circles is that if Mr. Stanton hits 62, he deserves to be recognized as the real record-holder \xe2\x80\x94 a man who, like Maris, is unsullied by intimations of skulduggery.'
p10042
aS'Time now for another favorite pastime of baseball fans: whataboutery.'
p10043
aS'What about the fact that ballparks are smaller today and thus cozier for power hitters than they used to be?'
p10044
aS'Oh yeah, what about Maris hitting his 61 in a longer season than Ruth had, and at a time when pitching strength was diluted by major league expansion?'
p10045
aS'Oh yeah, what about Ruth having it easier because he never had to face great pitchers like Satchel Paige or Bob Gibson because blacks couldn\xe2\x80\x99t play in the big leagues then?'
p10046
aS'The barroom quarreling can go on and on (and often does).'
p10047
aS'To add my two cents, no one has ever doubted the integrity, and the majesty, of Hank Aaron, who held the career record of 755 home runs until Mr. Bonds slipped past him with 762.'
p10048
aS'As for Babe Ruth and his single-season 60 dingers, let\xe2\x80\x99s simply note that he was a fellow of prodigious appetites.'
p10049
aS'He hit a lot of high balls, and drank a lot of highballs.'

aS'How can you not admire someone who accomplished so much while under the influence of performance- drugs?'

aS'Steve Bannon, the former presidential confidante, was as apocalyptic as ever about China on the eve of his trip to Hong Kong.'

aS'The man who had all but declared "economic war" with China in earlier interviews  , "A hundred years from now, this is what they\xe2\x80\x99ll remember \xe2\x80\x94 what we did to confront China on its rise to world domination".'
p10053
aS'On arrival,   to a big investor conference, he seemed to have softened a bit, praising China\xe2\x80\x99s leadership and offering hopes that a trade war could be averted.'
p10054
aS'Mr. Bannon reflects a basic tension in the Trump administration: whether to challenge China (and if so, where and when) or work with it.'
p10055
aS'There is, on the one hand, huge resentment toward Beijing \xe2\x80\x94 which Mr. Bannon shares \xe2\x80\x94 among those who believe that China has grown its economy at the expense of the working and middle classes.'
p10056
aS'(The focus of his speech was instructive: "American economic nationalism and the populist revolt and Asia," the three intertwined in his mind.'
p10057
aS') And then there are those who believe that without China\xe2\x80\x99s help there can be no serious deterrent to North Korea (which   last week), no lasting stability in the South China Sea and the Asian rim as a whole.'

aS'Their economies dwarf all others, they both have nuclear weapons, they both have veto power in the United Nations Security Council.'
p10061
aS'Their appetites and ambitions shape the globe: Together they can make for a more peaceful world; as adversaries, they can make a mess of things.'
p10062
aS'To some extent, President Trump seems to understand all that.'
p10063
aS'He engaged early with President Xi Jinping, at his Mar-a-Lago resort, and has sought to  , including a recent exchange that the president described as a "very strong phone call".'
p10064
aS'Yet, at the same time, he has failed to articulate a coherent strategy toward China or to achieve significant progress on the many consequential issues.'
p10065
aS'He seems also to lump all China-related issues into one big, menacing ball \xe2\x80\x94 trade, tariffs, North Korea \xe2\x80\x94 rather than dealing with them separately, and this has added more complications.'
p10066
aS'Additionally, the administration has been slow to get China experts into senior posts at the White House and State Department; for good or ill, Mr. Bannon was one person with Mr. Trump\xe2\x80\x99s ear who took a big interest in China.'
p10067
aS'Now there is no senior person with close ties to the president to oversee China policy, which does little to foster a consistent policy or reflect well on American leadership.'
p10068
aS'Against Mr. Trump\xe2\x80\x99s impulsiveness and his espousal of an America First agenda of isolationism and protectionism, Mr. Xi projects a steady hand as he tries to remake the global economic and political order and entice nations into Beijing\xe2\x80\x99s orbit.'
p10069
aS'Chinese trade is undeniably a big draw for many countries.'
p10070
aS'So is Mr. Xi\xe2\x80\x99s promised, though perhaps quixotic, $1 trillion investment in  , an ambitious network of trading routes and development projects \xe2\x80\x94 roads, ports, pipelines and the like from China to Africa and Europe \xe2\x80\x94 that seems also to have drawn Mr. Bannon\xe2\x80\x99s admiration.'
p10071
aS'Having long operated quietly in Russia\xe2\x80\x99s shadow at the United Nations, the Chinese are also speaking out more forcefully and engaging more robustly across multiple regions, a trend that has accelerated under Mr. Trump.'
p10072
aS'Meanwhile, Mr. Trump, unlike his predecessor, Barack Obama, who worked to expand American influence in Asia, has ceded significant ground to China, especially by withdrawing from the 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership and thus allowing Beijing an opening to set trade rules in the region.'

p10075
aS'In 2005, when President George W. Bush was in office, Robert Zoellick, then a deputy secretary of state, encouraged China to become a "responsible stakeholder" and help strengthen the Western-designed postwar international system from which it benefited.'
p10076
aS'Yet today more officials and experts are putting China in the adversary category, or leaning toward doing so, not least because of Beijing\xe2\x80\x99s decision to expand its military capability and project it further into the South China Sea.'
p10077
aS'Still, to anyone who steps back from the immediate conflicts over territory and trade, there is no alternative to cooperation on major challenges, even if interests aren\xe2\x80\x99t always aligned.'

p10086

aS'The progenitor of the apocryphal tale is Irwin Hoover, known as Ike, a butler and usher who worked in the White House for 42 years, including during Taft\xe2\x80\x99s term, from 1909 to 1913.'
p10308
aS'As Hoover wrote in his 1934 memoir, Taft "would stick" in the tub when bathing and had to be helped out "each time".'
p10309
aS'Who helped him out?'
p10310
aS'We don\xe2\x80\x99t know, because Hoover only vaguely refers to assistance from somewhere, but doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mention who supplied it, or whether they numbered more than one, let alone six.'
p10311
aS'And how did he or they get Taft out?'
p10312
aS'Hoover doesn\xe2\x80\x99t say it was a particularly arduous event \xe2\x80\x94 just that he needed "help" \xe2\x80\x94 and there\xe2\x80\x99s certainly no mention of butter.'
p10313
aS'There are no other eyewitnesses.'
p10314
aS'There\xe2\x80\x99s just one secondhand account to be found in Lillian Rogers Parks\xe2\x80\x99 1961 memoir, "My 30 Years Backstairs at the White House".'
p10315
aS'But the maid and seamstress started working in the president\xe2\x80\x99s house 10 years after Taft, for whom her mother worked, had left office.'
p10316
aS'In the 104 years since Taft left the White House, the tale has only gotten taller, though no historian has ever substantiated it.'
p10317
aS'The University of Virginia\xe2\x80\x99s otherwise excellent  , with specializes in presidential scholarship, echoed the myth in its biographical entry on Taft, saying that "the nation\xe2\x80\x99s press had a field day" with the story.'
p10318
aS'Many historic newspapers are thankfully digitized, and yet no articles exist.'
p10319
aS'I looked.'
p10320
aS'I even contacted Peri E. Arnold, the professor of political science at the University of Notre Dame listed as the author of the Miller Center entry, who confirmed it was "fable," but he had not in turn alerted the center.'
p10321
aS'I did, and they removed the line.'
p10322
aS'The best gossip, of course, always contains a grain of truth.'
p10323
aS'Taft was, indeed, very fond of bathtubs.'
p10324
aS'He had an extra large one installed in the White House and on several ships, including the cruiser North Carolina, on which he sailed to Panama to oversee the construction of the canal in 1912.'
p10325
aS'There is a famous photo of that seven-foot-long tub in which four of the men who installed it are comfortably seated inside, grinning at the camera.'
p10326
aS'A mini-Tubgate was   on June 19, 1915, when "the portly ex-President," at the time in Cape May, N.J., as a guest of the Pennsylvania Bankers Association, "had stepped in the tub without realizing the consequences of the sudden rise in the water and had stepped out without noticing the resulting deluge on the floor".'
p10327
aS'Plus, Taft broke up so-called  , a porcelain price-fixing ring given, in retrospect, an unfortunate name.'
p10328
aS'And Taft was certainly our heaviest president.'
p10329
aS'Jeffrey Rosen, the author of a  , said Americans saw him as "a kind of pop culture meme".'
p10330
aS'Taft entertained audiences with colorful anecdotes about his size, like the time Secretary of War Elihu Root, having heard he\xe2\x80\x99d taken 25-mile ride on horseback, sent a telegram asking "HOW IS THE HORSE"?'
p10331
aS'In 1909, Taft delivered a speech called "He Who Conquers Himself is Greater than He Who Taketh a City," in which he viewed his weight through a constitutional lens: A healthy democracy and a healthy body are both dependent on self-restraint.'
p10332
aS'And boy, did he know it.'
p10333
aS'Taft had done his share of yo-yo dieting, seeking doctor\xe2\x80\x99s care with inconsistent success.'
p10334
aS'At his inauguration, he weighed 354 pounds, but by his death, he\xe2\x80\x99d gotten down to 280.'
p10335
aS'Presidential history is overflowing with impossibly colorful and insightful details about our nation\xe2\x80\x99s leaders, but too often what we repeat only satisfies our appetite for easy caricature, not a real understanding about who our presidents actually were.'
p10336
aS'Fortunately for Taft, history\xe2\x80\x99s a long game, and it\xe2\x80\x99s never too late to set the record straight.'
p10337
aS'So let\xe2\x80\x99s put to rest the bath story, once and for all, and focus on what may be his real tabloid legacy.'
p10338
aS'After all, Taft is credited with saving the Republican Party in 1912.'
p10339
aS'Without him, there might not be a President Donald J. Trump.'
p10340
aS'The suburbanization of America marches on.'
p10341
aS'That movement includes millennials, who, as it turns out, are not a monolithic generation of suburb-hating city dwellers.'
p10342
aS'Most of that generation represents a powerful global trend.'
p10343
aS'They may like the city, but they love the suburbs even more.'
p10344
aS'They are continuing to migrate to suburbs.'
p10345
aS'According to the latest Census Bureau statistics, 25- to 29-year-olds are about a quarter more likely to move from the city to the suburbs as vice versa; older millennials are more than twice as likely.'
p10346
aS'Their future \xe2\x80\x94 and that of the planet \xe2\x80\x94 lies on the urban peripheries.'
p10347
aS'Hurricanes Harvey and Irma made clear that, especially in suburbs, the United States desperately needs better drainage systems to handle the enormous amounts of rainfall expected from climate change.'
p10348
aS'They also made clear that new, sustainable suburbs can offer an advantage by expanding landscapes that can absorb water.'
p10349
aS'Housing affordability is a major driver of the appeal of suburbia, which has historically been, and still is, more affordable, especially for first-time home buyers.'
p10350
aS'Yet millennial suburbanites want a new kind of landscape.'
p10351
aS'They want breathing room but disdain the energy wastefulness, visual monotony and social conformity of postwar manufactured neighborhoods.'
p10352
aS'If new suburbs can hit the sweet spot that accommodates the priorities of that generation, millennial habitats will redefine everyday life for all suburbanites, which is 70 percent of Americans.'
p10353
aS'How can technology, revolutionary design and planning transform suburban living?'
p10354
aS'Climate will determine how environmental goals can be achieved in a given place: solar in the Sunbelt, say, or advanced water management in the rainy regions like the Pacific Northwest.'
p10355
aS'Suburbs of the same age or size don\xe2\x80\x99t share the same potential benefits or needs.'
p10356
aS'Here are some ideas to shape future suburbs into smart, efficient and more sustainable places to live.'
p10357
aS'Existing suburbs were developed to maximize house and lot sizes, and some are often locked into aesthetic compliance, like mowed lawns.'
p10358
aS'These communities were also built around cars.'
p10359
aS'Many residential developments offer small parks or playgrounds within walking distance, but require cars to get to bigger recreation areas.'
p10360
aS'In sustainable new suburbs, house and lot sizes are smaller \xe2\x80\x94 in part because driveways and garages are eliminated \xe2\x80\x94 paving is reduced up to 50 percent and landscapes are more flexible.'
p10361
aS'The plant-to-pavement ratio of today\xe2\x80\x99s suburb is much higher than that of cities, but the next generation of suburbs can be even better at absorbing water.'
p10362
aS'House and open community spaces are set among teardrop-shaped one-way roads, which encourage predictable, safe separation of pedestrians and moving vehicles.'
p10363
aS'New suburban developments will utilize technology like autonomous electric cars (parked at solar-powered remote lots) and smart street lighting, which minimize energy use and harmful environmental impact.'
p10364
aS'Communities will share neighborhood amenities like public access areas, drone ports for deliveries, car pull overs (a wider shoulder in the road for pickup and drop-off) rather than private driveways and open common spaces.'
p10365
aS'Businesses also like locations on urban peripheries.'
p10366
aS'That dynamic is helping to reshape suburbia\xe2\x80\x99s traffic patterns, since many cars avoid urban centers.'
p10367
aS'As cars move to renewable energy, emissions and road noise will diminish.'
p10368
aS'In the near term, we should hope to see more efficient cars and on ride sharing.'
p10369
aS'The use of drones will reduce the need for many car errands \xe2\x80\x94 and their emissions: With their unrestricted air space, suburban communities are likely to be first to receive package deliveries from the drones being tested by Amazon.'
p10370
aS'They would be either hub-based, at Amazon warehouses, within 15 to 20 miles of customers, or truck-based, as with U.P.S. or Workhorse, in which a truck stops and a drone deploys.'
p10371
aS'Small to medium packages \xe2\x80\x94 86 percent of Amazon deliveries are under five pounds \xe2\x80\x94 can be handled by current drones and deliver to covered areas at doorways or at shared car pull-offs.'
p10372
aS'In a future suburban development, a homeowner will order an autonomous car, via an app, from a remote solar-charging lot.'
p10373
aS'As a car approaches, it will "talk" to a home: Lights and other utilities are activated or shut off for greater energy efficiency.'
p10374
aS'Because these suburban homes will not have driveways or garages, front yards can be bigger, devoted to ecological functions or recreational activities.'
p10375
aS'The neighborhoods will be friendlier for pedestrians, with sidewalks and paths that connect to open spaces and communal areas.'
p10376
aS'Before we had fenced-off backyards.'
p10377
aS'In the future we\xe2\x80\x99ll have common recreation spaces or vegetable gardens.'
p10378
aS'Or they can be designed for shared landscape features like forest, vernal ponds or wetlands that help manage storm runoff and control flooding.'
p10379
aS'Climate change has resulted in heavier rainfall when storms do come, and there\xe2\x80\x99s a need to store all of this water to prevent catastrophic urban flooding.'
p10380
aS'Less pavement in suburbia means the ground absorbs more rain and snow and less storm water pours into heavily paved urban areas nearby.'
p10381
aS'Planners need to view cities, suburbs and exurbs not as discrete units but as regions, with one integrated environmental and technological system.'
p10382
aS'It\xe2\x80\x99s rare that such a profound change of vision for the future is so close to being achievable.'
p10383
aS'And the millennial generation, with their there\xe2\x80\x99s-an-app-for-that outlook, is the one that will adopt it.'
p10384
aS'They find beauty in the utilitarian, and they know just how quickly radical technologies can change everything \xe2\x80\x94 including the suburb they want to call home.'
p10385
aS'Michelle Jones served 20 years in prison for a heinous crime: murdering her 4-year-old son.'
p10386
aS'During her two decades behind bars, Ms. Jones compiled a record of accomplishment that would be remarkable even for someone who had never been locked up.'
p10387
aS'She published a scholarly   on the first prisons for women in the United States.'
p10388
aS'She wrote a play that will open in December in an Indianapolis theater.'
p10389
aS'She led a team of incarcerated women whose efforts won the Indiana Historical Society\xe2\x80\x99s prize for best research project for 2016.'
p10390
aS'Not best research project by prisoners.'
p10391
aS'Best project.'
p10392
aS'Period.'
p10393
aS'All of this helped Ms. Jones gain admission to N.Y.U.\xe2\x80\x99s doctoral program in American studies, where she started last week.'
p10394
aS'But Ms. Jones\xe2\x80\x99s stunning record wasn\xe2\x80\x99t good enough for top administrators at Harvard University, as this paper   on Thursday.'
p10395
aS'In a rare move, they overturned the history department\xe2\x80\x99s admission recommendation and rejected Ms. Jones.'
p10396
aS'Ms. Jones\xe2\x80\x99s remarkable story put me in mind of a similar one \xe2\x80\x94 that of  , the Yale Law graduate whose initial application to the Connecticut bar was recently rejected.'
p10397
aS'Mr. Betts, who was convicted of carjacking in 1996 when he was 16, went on to astonishing success after his release in 2005, including publishing three books, being admitted to a Ph.D. program and being accepted to all of the nation\xe2\x80\x99s top law schools.'
p10398
aS'Yet as he continues to pursue admission to the bar, it\xe2\x80\x99s clear that what matters most is the crime he committed as a teenager.'
p10399
aS'Cases like that of Ms. Jones and Mr. Betts come at an inflection point in the nation\xe2\x80\x99s history.'
p10400
aS'After 50 years of prison building, more and more Americans are expressing doubts about the harsh policies that have made this country the world\xe2\x80\x99s largest jailer.'
p10401
aS'At the same time, some of the people who have spent serious time in our jails have such impressive resumes that they are penetrating the world of the elite.'
p10402
aS'For so long, the world of "us" never touched the world of "them" in many corners of American society.'
p10403
aS'Because of people like Michelle Jones, that is changing.'
p10404
aS'What will the gatekeepers of privilege do when confronted with gold-star applicants who have a criminal record?'
p10405
aS'Harvard\xe2\x80\x99s answer \xe2\x80\x94 you can never outlive your crime \xe2\x80\x94 is an affront to a first-rate candidate and brings shame on those responsible.'
p10406
aS'But Harvard\xe2\x80\x99s rejection of Ms. Jones (and my university, Yale, rejected her as well, though the reasons remain unclear) is more than that.'
p10407
aS'It reveals the truth about why mass punishment persists and the lie we are telling ourselves about the possibility of redemption.'
p10408
aS'Here\xe2\x80\x99s the thing about harsh justice in America.'
p10409
aS'More and more people criticize it, but most eagerly shift the blame for who is responsible.'
p10410
aS'I saw this repeatedly in California, where I just spent a year living and teaching.'
p10411
aS'I lost count of the number of conversations I had with colleagues and friends about criminal justice in which somebody bemoaned the state of affairs in "the Trump states".'
p10412
aS'I responded by bringing up the fact that California led the prison-building movement in the 1980s and \xe2\x80\x9990s, and would share stories about a visit to San Quentin prison, located just across the water from San Francisco, where I met dozens of men serving life sentences.'
p10413
aS'Nobody from the Trump states put them there, or is keeping them there, I would say.'
p10414
aS'That\xe2\x80\x99s on California voters and their elected officials.'
p10415
aS'That\xe2\x80\x99s on you.'
p10416
aS'I suspect that the administrators and professors who helped block Ms. Jones\xe2\x80\x99s admission are a lot like my friends in Connecticut and California.'
p10417
aS'They consider themselves liberal, and they think mass incarceration is a problem.'
p10418
aS'Somebody\xe2\x80\x99s else\xe2\x80\x99s problem.'
p10419
aS'Blame the judges, prosecutors, legislators, police, probation officers, prison guards.'
p10420
aS'Just not us.'
p10421
aS'But rejecting an overwhelmingly qualified candidate like Michelle Jones for no reason other than her criminal record sends a clear message from the bastion of liberalism on the banks of the Charles: If something is to be done to make America more just and merciful, somebody else is supposed to do it.'
p10422
aS'It also exposes the way that our unforgiving system of justice has touched all of our institutions.'
p10423
aS'In court, judges tell people that their conviction carries a sentence of years, or probation.'
p10424
aS'The truth is far more terrible.'
p10425
aS'People convicted of crimes often become social outcasts for life, finding it difficult or impossible to rent an apartment, get a job, adopt children, access public benefits, serve on juries or vote.'
p10426
aS'As eager as I am to champion Ms. Jones\xe2\x80\x99s cause, I do so with one crucial caveat.'
p10427
aS'Michelle Jones and Reginald Dwayne Betts capture our attention because of their extraordinary accomplishments.'
p10428
aS'As compelling as their stories are, we cannot let these exceptional people become the standard by which we judge somebody returning from prison.'
p10429
aS'You shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t need to win awards from a state historical society to gain admission to a Ph.D. program, and admission to the bar shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be reserved for those who write three books and obtain multiple degrees.'
p10430
aS'Mass incarceration and its never-ending human toll will be with us until we come to see that no crime justifies permanent civic death.'
p10431
aS'N.Y.U.\xe2\x80\x99s acceptance of Michelle Jones is an example of an institution leading the way toward a more forgiving nation.'
p10432
aS'Harvard\xe2\x80\x99s rejection of her shows just how far we still have to go.'
p10433
aS'These days, the news is full of sensational stories of violent campus mobs shutting down conservative speakers and freaked-out college administrators treating rioters with kid gloves.'
p10434
aS'Such stories offer excellent fodder for critics who are eager to condemn university culture.'
p10435
aS'But I believe they distract from a deeper, subtler intellectual problem on the modern campus: the profound alienation of professors who don\xe2\x80\x99t hold the mainstream political views and are treated as outsiders as a result.'
p10436
aS'This is the argument of an important book titled "Passing on the Right: Conservative Professors in the Progressive University".'
p10437
aS'Written by the political scientists Jon A. Shields and Joshua M. Dunn Sr., it gives a glimpse into the lonely lives of ideological strangers on the modern campus.'
p10438
aS'While conservatives represent America\xe2\x80\x99s largest ideological group, at 36 percent of the population, they constitute less than 10 percent of faculty in the social sciences and humanities \xe2\x80\x94 and a small fraction of that at elite private schools.'
p10439
aS'Many report feeling like oddballs who never quite fit in.'
p10440
aS'Generally, these professors fear they have little hope for advancement to leadership roles.'
p10441
aS'Research backs up this fear, suggesting that intellectual conformity is still a key driver of personal success in academic communities.'
p10442
aS'In a study published in 2012 in the Journal of Experimental Social Psychology, researchers asked students to evaluate candidates vying to represent them with the faculty.'
p10443
aS'In some cases, the candidate identified him- or herself as a "typical student at this college"; other subjects were given a candidate who was "a relatively untypical student at this college".'
p10444
aS'Even though both pledged to represent the students faithfully, in the same language, the untypical student consistently received significantly less support.'
p10445
aS'Some might argue that it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter \xe2\x80\x94 or is even a good thing \xe2\x80\x94 that conservatives on campus are marginalized.'
p10446
aS'After all, there are many organizations in which philosophical differences are legitimately disqualifying.'
p10447
aS'No one believes that there is anything strange about a Christian church seeking as clergy members only those who share the congregation\xe2\x80\x99s faith and theology.'
p10448
aS'Buddhists may be wonderful people, but they still need not apply for the job.'
p10449
aS'But such discrimination is legitimate only when it pertains to the core mission of an organization.'
p10450
aS'It would be less sensible and acceptable for a congregation to reject the best-qualified theologian and preacher because of how he or she voted in a presidential election.'
p10451
aS'That church would be prioritizing ephemeral political battles ahead of its deepest spiritual concerns.'
p10452
aS'That\xe2\x80\x99s a pretty bad trade.'
p10453
aS'Similarly, academia is right to rank candidates based on their expertise and intellectual commitment.'
p10454
aS'But should professors\xe2\x80\x99 political philosophies factor into how welcome they are or the likelihood of their leading departments and institutions?'
p10455
aS'Only if the fundamental goal of the university is more political than scholarly.'
p10456
aS'So which is the primary goal of universities today?'
p10457
aS'They are in the process of deciding.'
p10458
aS'If they decide the answer is scholarship, they must work harder to form communities that do not just tolerate conservatives but actively embrace ideological diversity.'
p10459
aS'They must be willing to see conservative faculty members not as interlopers to be tolerated but as valued colleagues, worthy of promotion and appointments to leadership roles when merited.'
p10460
aS'Fortunately, this problem is not insoluble.'
p10461
aS'It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t that long ago that women were similarly isolated in academia, that it was unusual in many departments to have a female professor and practically unthinkable that a woman be a university president.'
p10462
aS'To be sure, there is still gender discrimination, but a huge amount of headway has been made in integrating departments and elevating women to positions of academic leadership.'
p10463
aS'Why?'
p10464
aS'Because the community has come to see that gender discrimination is inconsistent with a good university\xe2\x80\x99s mission.'
p10465
aS'That\xe2\x80\x99s true progress.'
p10466
aS'There are nascent efforts underway to do the same with ideology.'
p10467
aS'Several top-tier private universities \xe2\x80\x94 notably Princeton, Harvard, Stanford and Chicago \xe2\x80\x94 have made important commitments to protect intellectual diversity on campus.'
p10468
aS'And a new coalition of academics called Heterodox Academy, directed by the New York University psychologist Jonathan Haidt, has formed to foster this movement.'
p10469
aS'Notably, more than 40 percent of the members of Heterodox Academy are liberals or centrists.'
p10470
aS'And this brings me to a point I want to make to progressive academics: It is up to you to make campuses more open to debate and the unconstrained pursuit of truth.'
p10471
aS'This is partly because liberals are in an overwhelming majority on campus.'
p10472
aS'But more important, the task fits perfectly the progressive movement\xe2\x80\x99s ethical patrimony.'
p10473
aS'American liberalism has always insisted it is the duty of the majority to fight for the minority, whether or not it suits one\xe2\x80\x99s own private interests.'
p10474
aS'Welcoming the stranger is arguably the greatest moral tradition that liberals have.'
p10475
aS'As we start a new school year, there is a golden opportunity to demonstrate this.'
p10476
aS'The new energy abundance in the United States has given President Trump a historic opportunity not just to expand the country\xe2\x80\x99s economy at home, but also to expand its leadership globally.'
p10477
aS'To maximize this opportunity, he should think about energy as more than a driver of economic growth, overcome the powerful political forces favoring isolationism and retrenchment, and rein in his tendency to alienate countries that should be energy allies of the United States.'
p10478
aS'The embrace of new technologies to extract oil and natural gas at an unprecedented rate has transformed one of America\xe2\x80\x99s enduring vulnerabilities into a strategic asset.'
p10479
aS'Thanks largely to fracking \xe2\x80\x94 hydraulic fracturing of rock \xe2\x80\x94 the United States is now the largest producer of oil and gas combined in the world.'
p10480
aS'America consumes large quantities of energy, so this expanded production has not yet made the country energy independent.'
p10481
aS'But it has greatly decreased its dependence on foreign energy: About a decade ago, the United States imported nearly two-thirds of the oil it consumed; that percentage is now closer to one-fifth.'
p10482
aS'America is now the largest exporter of refined petroleum products and, in the past year, has also become an exporter of crude oil and liquefied natural gas.'
p10483
aS'The benefits of this surge in production go well beyond cheaper gasoline, an improved trade balance and a stronger economy.'
p10484
aS'The boom has also improved the country\xe2\x80\x99s sources of soft power, in part by underscoring America\xe2\x80\x99s enduring edge in innovation and ingenuity.'
p10485
aS'The new output has forced changes in the structure of energy markets in ways that are favorable to the United States.'
p10486
aS'American producers of oil from shale rock have introduced a new business model to the scene: Small investments in exploration and production can bring oil to the market quickly.'
p10487
aS'This weakens OPEC, by making it more difficult for its production cuts to result in sustained increases in oil prices.'
p10488
aS'For the first time in more than a century, the market determines the price of oil with much less influence from any cartel, commission or band of big oil companies.'
p10489
aS'New supplies of natural gas \xe2\x80\x94 and ever cheaper technologies for liquefying it and transporting it \xe2\x80\x94 have helped integrate formerly fractured natural gas markets and made them more efficient.'
p10490
aS'These changes have empowered the consumer of natural gas over the producer \xe2\x80\x94 a big reversal from recent years.'
p10491
aS'The energy boom has also weakened many of America\xe2\x80\x99s competitors, particularly Russia, by both decreasing its revenues and reducing its ability to use its energy resources as a political cudgel.'
p10492
aS'The boom also expands opportunities for the United States to forge new partnerships.'
p10493
aS'For instance, given China\xe2\x80\x99s growing dependence, and America\xe2\x80\x99s waning reliance, on Middle Eastern oil, Beijing may be more likely to work with the United States to stabilize that part of the world.'
p10494
aS'Such changes put America in a stronger position to reinforce the international order.'
p10495
aS'Domestically, Mr. Trump has made energy a centerpiece of his efforts to strengthen our economy and create jobs, but he needs to do more than loosen restrictions on oil and gas production: Many non-energy policies of the Trump administration undermine the energy boom and all its potential advantages.'
p10496
aS'President Trump\xe2\x80\x99s protectionist impulses, for instance, do not square neatly with a booming energy sector.'

aS'Pulling out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, renegotiating Nafta under the threat of withdrawal and the questioning of the free-trade agreement with South Korea weaken the strong links between trade, global growth and rising energy demand; flagging global energy demand will hurt prospects for American exports of oil and gas.'
p10498
aS'On climate, Mr. Trump\xe2\x80\x99s pledge to withdraw the United States from the Paris agreement could also hurt the American energy boom.'
p10499
aS'Natural gas stands to gain as the world takes strides to tackle climate change: As countries transition to more sustainable energy, they often move away from coal to natural gas.'
p10500
aS'American natural gas exports could benefit from this transition \xe2\x80\x94 but not if countries like China and India also weaken their commitment to tackling climate change and drag their heels in curbing coal consumption.'
p10501
aS'Similarly, Mr. Trump\xe2\x80\x99s talk of retrenchment overseas has made friends and foes nervous about America\xe2\x80\x99s willingness to continue to use its vast sea power to maintain open shipping lanes.'
p10502
aS'Over half of the world\xe2\x80\x99s oil supply and a growing percentage of the natural gas it consumes is transported through these waterways.'
p10503
aS'The aggressive orientation of the Trump administration toward Mexico is also a potential problem for America\xe2\x80\x99s energy sector and the pursuit of energy security.'
p10504
aS'Mexico is by far the largest foreign consumer of American natural gas \xe2\x80\x94 a trend that will increase with recent Mexican electricity reforms.'
p10505
aS'Yet President Trump\xe2\x80\x99s talk about a border wall has spurred a revival in the presidential candidacy of Mexico\xe2\x80\x99s own populist,  , who is committed to reversing these and other energy reforms.'
p10506
aS'That would not only shrink the largest market for American natural gas but would also dull prospects of the United States, Canada and Mexico of reaching North American energy independence.'
p10507
aS'The Trump administration clearly recognizes that America\xe2\x80\x99s energy position is a huge asset to it.'
p10508
aS'But if it wants to fully embrace the opportunity at hand, it needs to integrate its welcome passion for America\xe2\x80\x99s energy revolution into its broader thinking on foreign policy \xe2\x80\x94 and make sure that it is not undercutting the strategic value of the boom with its non-energy policies.'

aS'I visited a summer camp in western Russia in July 2015.'

aS'Joseph Stalin, the Soviet leader who killed millions of Soviet citizens, was remembered fondly.'

p10517
aS'But my own country has memory problems, too.'
p10518
aS'Take the Civil War.'
p10519
aS'Historians tell us it was fought over slavery.'
p10520
aS'But an entirely different version unspooled last month at an Applebee\xe2\x80\x99s in Delaware.'
p10521
aS'"It\xe2\x80\x99s too simplified to say the war was over slavery," said Jeffrey Plummer, head of a local chapter of the Sons of the Confederate Veterans.'

aS'"That\xe2\x80\x99s what\xe2\x80\x99s been taught in the schools, but there\xe2\x80\x99s more to it".'

p10524
aS'Think of Turkey and its blank spot where the Armenian genocide should be.'
p10525
aS'Or Japan with its squeamishness about its aggression and mass murder in China.'
p10526
aS'It starts as a basic human impulse to take the sting out of defeat or to avoid admitting some atrocity.'
p10527
aS'But it\xe2\x80\x99s also a way to help cope with a difficult present.'
p10528
aS'And like a growth on a tree ring, it can keep the past off-kilter until some future generation is brave enough to right it.'
p10529
aS'"In most countries you are more likely to get evasion and nationalistic versions of history than tough grappling with the darker parts of your past, and the U.S. is no exception," said Gary Bass, a professor of politics and international affairs at Princeton.'

aS'In the United States, the Civil War remains "the most divisive and unresolved experience Americans have ever had," according to David Blight, a historian at Yale.'
p10531
aS'"The Civil War is like a sleeping dragon. If you poke it hard enough, it will raise its head and breathe fire".'
p10532
aS'That is, in part, because the loser was allowed its own interpretation.'
p10533
aS'The South, facing catastrophic loss of life and mass destruction on a European scale, wrote its own history of the war.'
p10534
aS'It cast itself as an underdog overwhelmed by the North\xe2\x80\x99s superior numbers, but whose cause \xe2\x80\x94 a noble fight for states\xe2\x80\x99 rights \xe2\x80\x94 was just.'
p10535

aS'"The whole notion of honoring the Confederacy and the sacrifice that your family made became part of what we taught in the schools," said Charles Dew, a Williams College historian whose book "Apostles of Disunion" describes the white supremacist arguments that underpinned the South\xe2\x80\x99s case for leaving the Union.'
p10539
aS'To correct the record, Mr. Dew gave talks about his book in the early 2000s, as part of the National Park Service\xe2\x80\x99s efforts to clarify the causes of the war.'
p10540
aS'Some audiences pushed back, saying, "My family did not own slaves, so how could they have been fighting for slavery"?'
p10541
aS'"I\xe2\x80\x99m not trying to denigrate your ancestors," Mr. Dew said he told those people.'

aS'Germany is the exception.'
p10551
aS'It took a generation, but German society faced its Nazi past and has emerged as an exemplary democratic culture.'

aS'"The German cause had no equivalent".'
p10557
aS'But while top Nazis were put on trial right after the war, with the world watching, mainstream German society did not fully grapple with the crimes until the 1960s.'
p10558
aS'There was a political shift to the left that encouraged young Germans who posed hard questions about their parents\xe2\x80\x99 past.'
p10559
aS'Even today, there are no major memorials to the perhaps half a million Germans who died in Allied bombing campaigns in Hamburg, Dresden and other cities, as that would be seen an assertion of equivalence.'

aS'Leftists then had a strong voice in the media and universities, encouraged by liberals in the American occupation, and the history being taught was starting to grapple with Japan\xe2\x80\x99s wartime atrocities against other Asian peoples.'
p10562
aS'But that early reckoning got bogged down in politics: The United States, together with Japanese liberals, decided the problem was Japanese militarism and gave the country a pacifist Constitution.'
p10563
aS'That alienated the right, causing a rift that persists to this day.'
p10564

p10566
aS'It is a moment for public education like no other, but with risks.'
p10567
aS'When history\xe2\x80\x99s losers get to define the story, it can create rifts \xe2\x80\x94 with allies, with adversaries or even with our fellow citizens.'

aS'After the plane landed, a bus took us to a ferry, and beneath it we felt the sea.'
p10575
aS'We were tired, hungry, in pain, and in fear about it all.'
p10576
aS'We were gagged, blindfolded and shackled.'
p10577
aS'We were dragged from the ferry to our cages.'
p10578
aS'When we arrived at our cages, we whispered to one another, "There is a sea around".'
p10579
aS'We could feel it despite all of the pain, confusion and fear.'
p10580
aS'All we were waiting for at the beginning was the sea.'
p10581
aS'Few detainees had seen the sea before coming to Guant\xc3\xa1namo.'
p10582
aS'All that the Afghans knew was that it was a lot of water that kills and eats people.'
p10583
aS'They started asking about the sea.'
p10584
aS'People who knew what the sea was, mostly people like me, from Arab countries, tried to explain it to the Afghans, but that made them even more afraid.'
p10585
aS'An Afghan pointed to a cargo plane, and said, "The sea is big like this"?'
p10586
aS'Bigger, he was told.'
p10587
aS'"Ships can carry many planes that size," another detainee said.'
p10588
aS'The Afghans told other detainees that the American interrogators threatened them, saying, "When we finish with you here, you will be taken to the sea, and you all will be thrown there".'
p10589
aS'It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a good beginning with the sea.'
p10590
aS'When we arrived, the first thing we wanted to know was our location.'
p10591
aS'As Muslims, we pray five times a day, and we must face the Holy Kaaba in Mecca.'
p10592
aS'The direction toward Mecca was impossible to determine when we first got to Guant\xc3\xa1namo.'
p10593
aS'Detainees started to consider the facts available: the weather, the birds, the sea.'
p10594
aS'Then, anything that would tell us about our location.'
p10595
aS'Even dreams.'
p10596
aS'One detainee said, "Based on my dream, we are in Oman".'
p10597
aS'Some guessed we were in India because the pipes that held up our cells\xe2\x80\x99 fences had "Made in India" written on them.'
p10598
aS'Finally, after many months, some detainees who were arrested after Guant\xc3\xa1namo was known about were brought in.'
p10599
aS'They told us we are in Cuba, in Guant\xc3\xa1namo.'
p10600
aS'Some of us might have heard of Cuba, but never Guant\xc3\xa1namo.'
p10601
aS'Some detainees wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t believe it.'
p10602
aS'In the beginning, it was hard for us to pronounce that name, or even memorize it.'
p10603
aS'All we knew was there was the sea.'
p10604
aS'Some of the camps in Guant\xc3\xa1namo were closer to the sea than others.'
p10605
aS'After a few months, we were moved from Camp X-Ray to Camp Delta, which was closer to the sea, but we weren\xe2\x80\x99t allowed to see it.'
p10606
aS'The many fences around us were covered with green tarp to block us from seeing the sea.'
p10607
aS'Once, I tried to tear off the tarp, but guards saw me and I was sent to isolation.'
p10608
aS'We tried many times to tear off that tarp.'
p10609
aS'When we did, we saw that there were more walls of fences and tarps, so it was useless.'
p10610
aS'People will do anything to take their minds away from hell.'
p10611
aS'To remind themselves that a world beyond the hell of Guant\xc3\xa1namo still existed, we wanted to show the Afghans the sea.'
p10612
aS'No matter how we described the sea for them, we knew they must see it for themselves.'
p10613
aS'We got some magazines to show them what it looked like.'
p10614
aS'"A lot of water," they said.'
p10615
aS'"How can it carry those ships"?'
p10616
aS'We explained to them about earth and the proportion of the land to the seas, the rivers, the oceans, how ships sail on water and what kind of ships.'
p10617
aS'Years passed, and we missed everything in our lives.'
p10618
aS'It was hard not seeing the sea, despite its being only a few hundred feet away from us.'
p10619
aS'At the recreation area, if we lay on our stomach, we could get glimpses of the sea through small openings below the tarp.'
p10620
aS'When the guards found out, they blocked the openings.'
p10621
aS'In some cells, in some blocks, we could stand on the windows at the back of our cells to see the sea, but that was risky, because the guards punished us every time they saw us standing and looking out.'
p10622
aS'Whenever any of us wanted to look at the sea, we needed to ask one of the other detainees to watch for the guards and warn us if they came around the block.'
p10623
aS'It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t long before the administration made higher covers, blocking us from seeing the sea.'
p10624
aS'When we asked why, we were told it was for security and safety.'
p10625
aS'We couldn\xe2\x80\x99t see more than 30 feet beyond our cells at best \xe2\x80\x94 walls, fences, green tarps covering everything.'
p10626
aS'I remember how those who couldn\xe2\x80\x99t see the sea kept asking the others to tell them what they saw.'
p10627
aS'But something happened in 2014 that let most of us, finally, see the sea.'
p10628
aS'News that a hurricane was headed toward Cuba caused camp administration to take down the green tarps that blocked us from seeing the sea.'
p10629
aS'The detainees looked so happy when the guards started taking down the covers.'
p10630
aS'We all faced one direction: toward the sea.'
p10631
aS'It felt like a little freedom, to look at it.'
p10632
aS'I heard an Afghan guy shout, "Allahu akbar"!'
p10633
aS'at the sight, thanking God for the wonder of the sea, repeating that many times, calling out to his friends.'
p10634
aS'The tarps remained down for a few days, and the detainees started making art about the sea.'
p10635
aS'Some wrote poems about it.'
p10636
aS'And everyone who could draw drew the sea.'
p10637
aS'I could see different meanings in each drawing, color and shape.'
p10638
aS'I could see the detainees put their dreams, feelings, hopes and lives in them.'
p10639
aS'I could see some of these drawings were mixtures of hope and pain.'
p10640
aS'That the sea means freedom no one can control or own, freedom for everyone.'
p10641
aS'Each of us found a way to escape to the sea.'
p10642
aS'Those who could see the sea spent most of their time watching, listening and looking at that big blue color, which cools our souls.'
p10643
aS'The sea was a little rough, because of the windy weather.'
p10644
aS'Huge waves that rose high and hit the land.'
p10645
aS'Looking at a sea like that was scary, but it was what we got, and it felt good.'
p10646
aS'Afghans started calling out to one another and expressing their feelings about what they saw, and turned to us with many questions about that beast.'
p10647
aS'Those days without the tarps were like a vacation.'
p10648
aS'On the last day the sea looked refreshed, calm and lovely.'
p10649
aS'A huge ship sailed close by.'
p10650
aS'Detainees called out to one another to look at the ship.'
p10651
aS'We kept looking at it like something magic would happen and all of us would be freed.'
p10652
aS'But the ship just disappeared.'
p10653
aS'The next day the workers returned and blocked our sight.'
p10654
aS'Kara Walker has had enough.'
p10655
aS'Since her 1994 New York debut, at just 24 years old, at the Drawing Center, she and her artworks have been hailed as " " " " " " and " ".'
p10656
aS'She has won a MacArthur fellowship, was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Letters and has been widely praised as among the most important black artists working today.'
p10657
aS'No pressure or anything.'
p10658
aS'Ms. Walker is, as she writes in the artist statement for her new show at   in New York, "tired of \xe2\x80\x98having a voice\xe2\x80\x99 or worse, \xe2\x80\x98being a role model. \xe2\x80\x99 " She is fed up with "being a featured member of my racial group and/or gender niche".'
p10659
aS'She also notes that her new work is not "activist" and we shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t expect answers from her: "I roll my eyes, fold my arms and wait".'
p10660
aS'Well, this is what Ms. Walker rolling her eyes and folding her arms looks like: a 151-by-191-inch work at the show, in sumi ink and collage, titled "Christ\xe2\x80\x99s Entry Into Journalism," which combines the imagined and the real as well as the past and present.'

aS'While Ms. Walker\xe2\x80\x99s work has always reflected the realities of black America, it has typically focused on the past, particularly the slavery of African-Americans.'
p10675
aS'Never has she so blatantly illustrated the modern.'
p10676
aS'That is why the dissonance between her canvases and her statement has rubbed many people the wrong way.'

aS'Meryl Streep was greeted with hosannas for her outspoken criticism of the president; Taylor Swift\xe2\x80\x99s silence has been condemned.'
p10683
aS'Ms. Walker gets all this \xe2\x80\x94 perhaps better than most, given that her work has long been criticized by prominent artists, black and white, who say it is reductive.'
p10684
aS'Her finger-wagging critics are missing the point when they go after her artist statement, which is nothing less than a big middle finger to our current culture of flame wars and empty words.'
p10685
aS'Her statement is another way of saying: Ignore the hot air.'
p10686
aS'Open your eyes and look at the work.'
p10687

p11192
aS'This longtime but informal Senate practice allows a senator to block the nomination of a judge from his or her home state by refusing to sign off on a blue-colored form.'
p11193
aS'The idea was to give senators, who are presumed to be more familiar with the lawyers and judges in their own states, a meaningful say in the choosing of those judges.'

aS'They expected the blue-slip policy "to be observed, even-handedly and regardless of party affiliation".'
p11200
aS'Lucky for them, it was.'
p11201
aS'Senator Patrick Leahy, the veteran Vermont Democrat and chairman of the Judiciary Committee at the time, applied the policy without exception, meaning that a single withheld blue slip would torpedo a judicial nomination.'

p11203
aS'One senator blocked a nominee because   the Constitution did not protect an individual right to bear arms \xe2\x80\x94 an accurate description of the uncertainty about the law at the time.'

p11214
aS'Unlike their Republican counterparts, however, these Democrats provided a clear explanation for their opposition: The White House, they said, made no meaningful effort to consult with them before making nominations.'
p11215
aS'Mr. Wyden and Mr. Merkley said Mr. Trump had completely bypassed Oregon\xe2\x80\x99s well-established bipartisan selection committee.'
p11216

p11217
aS'The Constitution gives the president the power to choose federal judges, but only with the "advice and consent" of the Senate.'
p11218
aS'In an earlier era of relative comity and good faith, the blue-slip tradition may have helped to ensure that advice was considered.'
p11219

p11220

aS'Mr. Obama made concessions to Republican senators in states like Oklahoma and Utah, and he tried for years to negotiate with others, often to no avail.'
p11223
aS'In contrast, Mr. Trump, not even eight months into his presidency, has farmed out the selection of judges to conservative advocacy groups like the Heritage Foundation and the Federalist Society, which have spent decades plotting for a right-wing takeover of the federal courts.'
p11224
aS'The push toward ever-more extreme judges will only further politicize the third branch.'
p11225
aS'Still, the blue slip is no longer the answer.'
p11226
aS'As  , senators who oppose a nominee can state their objections on the Senate floor and try to persuade their colleagues \xe2\x80\x94 something Mitch McConnell was too cowardly to do  , when he refused to allow even a hearing for Merrick Garland, Mr. Obama\xe2\x80\x99s pick for the Supreme Court vacancy.'
p11227
aS'For the next few years, at least, Democrats will have to grit their teeth and watch as hard-right judges begin to restock the federal bench.'

p11236
aS'Since Mr. Mnuchin is fifth in line of succession should anything happen to the president, this excuse was at least a tad more credible than the one offered for a ride he took with his wife, Louise Linton, last month that is also under official review.'
p11237
aS'That trip was to Kentucky, where the couple could view the solar eclipse in the path of totality.'
p11238
aS'The justification then was that Mr. Mnuchin wanted to speak with Kentuckians about tax reform and he needed to check on the gold at Fort Knox, which is presumably as safe and sound after Mr. Mnuchin\xe2\x80\x99s inspection as it was when he got there.'

aS'There are other things the Constitution wasn\xe2\x80\x99t written for, of course.'
p11470
aS'The founders didn\xe2\x80\x99t foresee America becoming a global superpower.'
p11471
aS'They didn\xe2\x80\x99t plan for the internet or nuclear weapons.'
p11472
aS'And they certainly couldn\xe2\x80\x99t have imagined a former reality television star president.'
p11473
aS'Commentators wring their hands over all of these transformations \xe2\x80\x94 though these days, they tend to focus on whether this country\xe2\x80\x99s founding document can survive the current president.'
p11474
aS'But there is a different, and far more stubborn, risk that our country faces \xe2\x80\x94 and which, arguably, led to the TV star turned president in the first place.'
p11475
aS'Our Constitution was not built for a country with so much wealth concentrated at the very top nor for the threats that invariably accompany it: oligarchs and populist demagogues.'
p11476
aS'From the ancient Greeks to the American founders, statesmen and political philosophers were obsessed with the problem of economic inequality.'
p11477
aS'Unequal societies were subject to constant strife \xe2\x80\x94 even revolution.'
p11478
aS'The rich would tyrannize the poor, and the poor would revolt against the rich.'
p11479
aS'The solution was to build economic class right into the structure of government.'
p11480
aS'In England, for example, the structure of government balanced lords and commoners.'
p11481
aS'In ancient Rome, there was the patrician Senate for the wealthy, and the Tribune of the Plebeians for everyone else.'
p11482
aS'We can think of these as class-warfare constitutions: Each class has a share in governing, and a check on the other.'
p11483
aS'Those checks prevent oligarchy on the one hand and a tyranny founded on populist demagogy on the other.'
p11484
aS'What is surprising about the design of our Constitution is that it isn\xe2\x80\x99t a class warfare constitution.'
p11485
aS'Our Constitution doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mandate that only the wealthy can become senators, and we don\xe2\x80\x99t have a tribune of the plebs.'
p11486
aS'Our founding charter doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have structural checks and balances between economic classes: not between rich and poor, and certainly not between corporate interests and ordinary workers.'
p11487
aS'This was a radical change in the history of constitutional government.'
p11488
aS'And it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t an oversight.'
p11489
aS'The founding generation knew how to write class-warfare constitutions \xe2\x80\x94 they even debated such proposals during the summer of 1787.'
p11490
aS'But they ultimately chose a framework for government that didn\xe2\x80\x99t pit class against class.'
p11491
aS'Part of the reason was practical.'
p11492
aS'from the secret debates at the Philadelphia Convention show that the delegates had a hard time agreeing on how they would design such a class-based system.'
p11493
aS'But part of the reason was political: They knew the American people wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t agree to that kind of government.'
p11494
aS'At the time, many Americans believed the new nation would not be afflicted by the problems that accompanied economic inequality because there simply wasn\xe2\x80\x99t much inequality within the political community of white men.'
p11495
aS'Today we tend to emphasize how undemocratic the founding era was when judged by our values \xe2\x80\x94 its exclusion of women, enslavement of African-Americans, violence against Native Americans.'
p11496
aS'But in doing so, we risk missing something important: Many in the founding generation believed America was exceptional because of the extraordinary degree of economic equality within the political community as they defined it.'
p11497
aS'Unlike Europe, America wasn\xe2\x80\x99t bogged down by the legacy of feudalism, nor did it have a hereditary aristocracy.'
p11498
aS'Noah Webster, best known for his dictionary, commented that there were "small inequalities of property," a fact that distinguished America from Europe and the rest of the world.'
p11499
aS'Equality of property, he believed, was crucial for sustaining a republic.'
p11500
aS'During the Constitutional Convention, South Carolinan Charles Pinckney said America had "a greater equality than is to be found among the people of any other country".'
p11501
aS'As long as the new nation could expand west, he thought, it would be possible to have a citizenry of independent yeoman farmers.'
p11502
aS'In a community with economic equality, there was simply no need for constitutional structures to manage the clash between the wealthy and everyone else.'
p11503
aS'The problem, of course, is that economic inequality has been on the rise for at least the last generation.'
p11504
aS'In 1976 the richest 1 percent of Americans took home about 8.5 percent of our national income.'
p11505
aS'Today they take home more than 20 percent.'
p11506
aS'In major sectors of the economy \xe2\x80\x94 banking, airlines, agriculture, pharmaceuticals, telecommunications \xe2\x80\x94 economic power is increasingly concentrated in a small number of companies.'
p11507
aS'While much of the debate has been on the moral or economic consequences of economic inequality, the more fundamental problem is that our constitutional system might not survive in an unequal economy.'
p11508
aS'Campaign contributions, lobbying, the revolving door of industry insiders working in government, interest group influence over regulators and even think tanks \xe2\x80\x94 all of these features of our current political system skew policy making to favor the wealthy and entrenched economic interests.'
p11509
aS'"The rich will strive to establish their dominion and enslave the rest," Gouverneur Morris observed in 1787.'
p11510
aS'"They always did. They always will".'
p11511
aS'An oligarchy \xe2\x80\x94 not a republic \xe2\x80\x94 is the inevitable result.'
p11512
aS'As a republic descends into an oligarchy, the people revolt.'
p11513
aS'Populist revolts are rarely anarchic; they require leadership.'
p11514
aS'Morris predicted that the rich would take advantage of the people\xe2\x80\x99s "passions" and "make these the instruments for oppressing them".'
p11515
aS'The future Broadway sensation Alexander Hamilton put it more clearly: "Of those men who have overturned the liberties of republics, the greatest number have begun their career by paying an obsequious court to the people: commencing demagogues, and ending tyrants".'
p11516
aS'Starting more than a century ago, amid the first Gilded Age, Americans confronted rising inequality, rapid industrial change, a communications and transportation revolution and the emergence of monopolies.'
p11517
aS'Populists and progressives responded by pushing for reforms that would tame the great concentrations of wealth and power that were corrupting government.'
p11518
aS'On the economic side, they invented antitrust laws and public utilities regulation, established an income tax, and fought for minimum wages.'
p11519
aS'On the political side, they passed campaign finance regulations and amended the Constitution so the people would get to elect senators directly.'
p11520
aS'They did these things because they knew that our republican form of government could not survive in an economically unequal society.'
p11521
aS'As Theodore Roosevelt wrote, "There can be no real political democracy unless there is something approaching an economic democracy".'
p11522
aS'For all its resilience and longevity, our Constitution doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have structural checks built into it to prevent oligarchy or populist demagogues.'
p11523
aS'It was written on the assumption that America would remain relatively equal economically.'
p11524
aS'Even the father of the Constitution understood this.'
p11525
aS'Toward the end of his life, Madison worried that the number of Americans who had only the "bare necessities of life" would one day increase.'
p11526
aS'When it did, he , the institutions and laws of the country would need to be adapted, and that task would require "all the wisdom of the wisest patriots".'
p11527
aS'With economic inequality rising and the middle class collapsing, the deep question we must ask today is whether our generation has wise patriots who, like the progressives a century ago, will adapt the institutions and laws of our country \xe2\x80\x94 and save our republic.'
p11528
aS'If you look closely at Brown v.'
p11529
aS'Board of Education, the landmark 1954 school desegregation decision, you\xe2\x80\x99ll see that Brown wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a single case.'
p11530
aS'It was five cases consolidated into one.'
p11531
aS'Briggs v.'
p11532
aS'Elliott, the first of them, took place in my home state, South Carolina.'
p11533
aS'Briggs came about after the Rev.'
p11534
aS'Joseph De Laine organized a group of black parents in Clarendon County to petition for equal educational facilities.'
p11535
aS'The man who stood fast against that request \xe2\x80\x94 the Elliott of Briggs v.'
p11536
aS'Elliott \xe2\x80\x94 was the chairman of the school board, Roderick Miles Elliott.'
p11537
aS'Or as he was known in my family, Uncle Roddy.'
p11538
aS'Although I grew up in South Carolina in the 1960s and \xe2\x80\x9970s, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t learn about Briggs v.'
p11539
aS'Elliott until I was an adult.'
p11540
aS'My father, Uncle Roddy\xe2\x80\x99s nephew, often talked about how shamefully black people were treated in Clarendon County, but he was deeply uncomfortable with the part our family had played.'
p11541
aS'Like most Southerners, he was skilled at avoiding unpleasant conversations, and in the case of Briggs, events conspired to help him.'
p11542
aS'For reasons that remain murky, the Supreme Court case came to be called Brown rather than Briggs, even though Briggs preceded Brown both alphabetically and temporally.'
p11543
aS'So it was Brown v.'
p11544
aS'Board of Education that was memorialized in the history textbooks, and our family name was spared association in the public mind with a racist cause.'
p11545
aS'I won\xe2\x80\x99t pretend I\xe2\x80\x99m not grateful.'
p11546
aS'But the fact that Brown has overshadowed Briggs has also meant that Mr. De Laine, the man who did more than anyone else to bring about school desegregation in South Carolina, has been too often forgotten.'
p11547
aS'This month, with the blessing of his surviving children, Joseph De Laine Jr. and Ophelia De Laine Gona, my cousin Joe Elliott \xe2\x80\x94 Uncle Roddy\xe2\x80\x99s grandson \xe2\x80\x94 submitted a   to the South Carolina legislature on behalf of 21 descendants and relatives of Roderick Miles Elliott (including me), asking the legislature to honor Mr. De Laine with a statue on the grounds of the State House in Columbia.'
p11548
aS'In a just world, the name of Joseph De Laine would already be familiar to South Carolinians.'
p11549
aS'Mr. De Laine was a minister in the African Methodist Episcopal Church and a teacher in the Clarendon County public schools, where his wife, Mattie, also taught.'
p11550
aS'Black schools in Clarendon County in the 1940s were in abysmal condition \xe2\x80\x94 dilapidated, poorly heated and woefully understaffed.'
p11551
aS'Children had to walk miles to attend school, because the school board, led by Uncle Roddy, refused to provide a bus.'
p11552
aS'It provided 30 buses for white children.'
p11553
aS'Mr. De Laine began organizing the parents of Clarendon County in 1947 and kept at it for the next seven years.'
p11554
aS'When the Supreme Court finally vindicated his cause in 1954, it used the dissenting opinion in Briggs as the legal backbone for its decision.'
p11555
aS'In South Carolina, however, Mr. De Laine\xe2\x80\x99s courage and tenacity were punished.'
p11556
aS'Both he and his wife lost their teaching jobs.'
p11557
aS'When an arsonist set fire to the De Laine home, which stood 60 feet outside the city limits of Summerton, S.C., the all-white firefighting squad in Summerton stood by and watched it burn to the ground.'
p11558
aS'Later, Mr. De Laine\xe2\x80\x99s church in Lake City was burned to the ground as well.'
p11559
aS'He was eventually forced to leave the state in 1955 after defending his home against a group of armed attackers.'
p11560
aS'Mr. De Laine died in Charlotte, N.C, in 1974.'
p11561
aS'Congress awarded Mr. De Laine a Gold Medal in 2004 (along with the Briggs petitioners Levi Pearson and Harry and Eliza Briggs), but a comparable gesture of recognition has never been made in South Carolina.'
p11562
aS'The state has no monuments to Mr. De Laine, and apart from a small interstate interchange near Summerton, no roads, bridges or public buildings bear his name.'
p11563
aS'Asking South Carolina to honor Mr. De Laine might seem quixotic.'
p11564
aS'It took decades of protest and the 2015 mass murder at Emanuel A.M.E. Church in Charleston before the Confederate flag came down from the South Carolina State House.'
p11565
aS'Sixty-three years after Brown, schools in Summerton remain de facto segregated, thanks in part to a private academy favored by many white families.'
p11566
aS'Change never comes easily in South Carolina, a state populated by stubborn iconoclasts who can be single-minded in the pursuit of hopeless causes.'
p11567
aS'To which I say: This is exactly why we should honor Mr. De Laine.'
p11568
aS'He showed us how to put that single-mindedness to work for the cause of righteousness.'
p11569
aS'School desegregation is often seen as a tool for justice, and rightly so.'
p11570
aS'But it is an equally powerful tool for friendship, love and solidarity.'
p11571
aS'Most of my generation of South Carolinians had the privilege of attending the integrated schools that Uncle Roddy fought against.'
p11572
aS'As a result, many of us have formed lasting relationships across racial lines in ways that would have been unimaginable to our Southern grandparents, both black and white.'
p11573
aS'If we can somehow make our way together through these dark times, it will be in no small part because of the vision of Joseph De Laine.'
p11574
aS'San Francisco \xe2\x80\x94 Just five years ago, I sued Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, the venture capital firm in Silicon Valley where I had worked since 2005, for bias and gender discrimination.'
p11575
aS'The lawsuit, which I lost, led to the venture capital world closing ranks against me.'
p11576
aS'I had trouble finding work.'
p11577
aS'People were afraid to support me publicly.'
p11578
aS'I was called a fraud, and greedy, and was accused of being in a fake marriage.'
p11579
aS'Now, over the past year, at least a dozen women have publicly shared their stories of being discriminated against and harassed in tech by their managers, by investors or by board members.'
p11580
aS'Privately, I have heard dozens more.'
p11581
aS'What I also hear, over and over again, is the question, "Has anything changed"?'
p11582
aS'The huge change is that people now acknowledge the problem.'
p11583
aS'Women telling their stories are believed, for the most part, by the public and by the press.'
p11584
aS'In February, with a clear and   about her time at Uber, Susan Fowler blew open the doors on bad behavior in tech.'
p11585
aS'She made deliberate choices that made her an unassailable commentator: no litigation, no P.R. firm and detailed descriptions of each incident left no room for a smear campaign or any question of impropriety.'
p11586
aS'Her clear and precise retelling of the harassment and retaliation she said she suffered \xe2\x80\x94 and the failures of management to fix it \xe2\x80\x94 are now widely known.'
p11587
aS'Before her post, others who spoke up publicly and privately about their experiences of harassment were at best ignored.'
p11588
aS'Some of those people \xe2\x80\x94 whose names are unfortunately not well known \xe2\x80\x94 include Adria Richards, Am\xc3\xa9lie Lamont, Gesche Haas, Julie Ann Horvath, Kathryn Minshew and Kelly Ellis.'
p11589
aS'Most were disrespected and harassed online, and many found it hard, as I did, to find work after public shaming.'
p11590
aS'We saw Gamergate attack female game developers and their supporters.'
p11591
aS'But they all paved the way for Ms. Fowler to be heard and believed, and for subsequent stories about sexist tech culture to be accepted at face value.'
p11592
aS'What followed Ms. Fowler\xe2\x80\x99s post was a first: a public overhaul of Uber; two investigations; a   from Eric Holder, the former attorney general, with recommendations for improvement; the forced departures of at least 20 employees linked to the findings, including some executives; and the board\xe2\x80\x99s stating its intent to follow the report\xe2\x80\x99s recommendations.'
p11593
aS'Many details were leaked or dug up \xe2\x80\x94 board conversations, a full audio recording of a conversation the former chief executive Travis Kalanick had with Uber\xe2\x80\x99s female engineers.'
p11594
aS'More women stepped up to report harassment in tech by venture capital investors and board members.'
p11595
aS'Apologies have been free-flowing.'
p11596
aS'Venture capitalists have made their mea culpas and the leaders of some well-known firms have resigned.'
p11597
aS'One partner at Greylock even wrote a " " for the industry \xe2\x80\x94 and Greylock\xe2\x80\x99s C.O.O. was asked to resign shortly thereafter.'
p11598
aS'Even Mr. Kalanick gave a tearful apology \xe2\x80\x94 around the same time his team\xe2\x80\x99s listening session with female engineers fell flat.'
p11599
aS'We\xe2\x80\x99re hearing about companies writing codes of conduct covering anti-harassment that they want their investors and board members to sign.'
p11600
aS'On its face, it all sounds like meaningful change, right?'
p11601
aS'Or at least it sounds a lot better than the very recent public shaming of women who came forward and the sweeping of bad behavior under the rug.'
p11602
aS'But let\xe2\x80\x99s not be blinded by optimism or biased by what we want to see: Certain actions, and lack of action, could keep us in this unfair loop indefinitely.'
p11603
aS'Public apologies and one-off actions are superficial ways to react to criticism or put on a happy face, but they often cover up company culture failures that are hard to fix, especially if no one is seriously trying.'
p11604
aS'Many continue to describe Uber and the outed venture capitalists as a few bad apples, not indicative of the entire industry \xe2\x80\x94 forgetting that the whole saying is actually "One bad apple spoils the bunch".'
p11605
aS'Their behavior is part of much broader and deeper culture problems that permeate all tech \xe2\x80\x94 which ignored, encouraged and sometimes rewarded bad behavior \xe2\x80\x94 at different levels.'

p11614
aS'They continue to pay only lip service to diversity and inclusion, favoring tepid diversity initiatives over real solutions.'
p11615
aS'It\xe2\x80\x99s all superficial until we see leaders actually changing company cultures by making hard decisions, leading uncomfortable conversations \xe2\x80\x94 and firing those who are unwilling to include everyone.'
p11616
aS'So how do we clear biases and power imbalances in tech so that everyone has a fair opportunity to succeed?'
p11617
aS'We need C.E.O.s to hold themselves and their teams accountable for true diversity and inclusion.'
p11618
aS'That means all people from all groups, not just women.'
p11619
aS'That means understanding intersectionality \xe2\x80\x94 that employees can face multiple biases based on identity.'
p11620
aS'That means all activities across the company, not just hiring.'
p11621
aS'Practically, it means measuring progress, holding people accountable for results by setting goals and basing their compensation on hitting those goals.'
p11622
aS'C.E.O.s lead the transformation from the top, and they need individual employees to focus efforts on change as well: Speak up, help others speak up, build bridges to those who are interested in changing and learning.'

aS'THE decision by the Trump administration to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program and to defer instead to Congress for a solution to the problem threw a wild card onto a congressional agenda that was already packed.'
p11628
aS'But far more important, it thrust the lives of roughly 800,000 of our friends and neighbors into instant uncertainty.'
p11629
aS'Washington being Washington, the administration\xe2\x80\x99s decision and its confusing aftermath produced heated and generally unhelpful rhetoric from the extremes of both political parties.'
p11630
aS'Having served as the Republican majority leader in the House of Representatives during the last major immigration debate, I understand the implications of this all too well.'
p11631
aS'In 2013, a year after the Obama administration established the DACA program, I announced that I was working on legislation to provide a more stable way forward for these so-called Dreamers: young people who had been brought into this country illegally as children and who knew no other home.'
p11632
aS'As we continued to gather support for the legislation and the 2014 election neared, protesters from both sides of the debate descended on Richmond, Va., my hometown, for dueling rallies.'
p11633
aS'Those from the left attacked me for blocking comprehensive reform because of my focus on Dreamers, while my friends on the right claimed I was promoting an amnesty.'
p11634
aS'I have long believed that America is a country of laws and that border security is paramount.'
p11635
aS'I also firmly believe that the principles of our founding dictate that children should not be punished for the illegal acts of their parents.'
p11636
aS'The Dreamers were not responsible for their situation, and as a compassionate nation and people we owed them our help: a legal process that could address their status effectively and permanently.'
p11637
aS'But Congress was gridlocked and my proposal went nowhere.'
p11638
aS'Fast forward to today.'
p11639
aS'The Trump administration has stated that the DACA program will end in six months unless Congress acts.'
p11640
aS'What will Congress do?'
p11641
aS'As President Barack Obama himself acknowledged, DACA is an imperfect and temporary solution.'
p11642
aS'Every two years Dreamers must renew their deferment from deportation and their work permit.'
p11643
aS'And while DACA makes it possible for them to enroll in college, they remain barred from receiving federal financial aid.'
p11644
aS'Even under DACA, the Dreamers never fully and legally integrate into our country.'
p11645
aS'Only Congress can fix this mess.'
p11646
aS'It should do so by providing a path for law-abiding Dreamers to obtain a green card and ultimately, full citizenship.'
p11647
aS'In exchange for a much improved program for Dreamers, Congress should significantly increase America\xe2\x80\x99s border security by funding additional personnel, technology and physical resources at our border.'
p11648
aS'While President Trump\xe2\x80\x99s "wall" has gotten all the political attention, much of the border can be secured more quickly and efficiently by other means.'
p11649
aS'In addition, Congress should require the institution of a comprehensive biometric entry-exit system to prevent visa overstays.'
p11650
aS'For Republicans, these measures are a critical first step before tackling broader immigration changes.'
p11651
aS'Of course, this is the sort of deal that the extreme wings of both parties will oppose, but it is exactly the type of sensible compromise the nation needs.'
p11652
aS'Over the past couple of days, we have heard that President Trump and some members of Congress are on the verge of such a compromise, only to later learn that there may not be a deal after all.'
p11653
aS'It\xe2\x80\x99s hard to say exactly what is happening, but it seems safe to say that the president, congressional Democrats and congressional Republicans all have different ideas of what constitutes "protecting the Dreamers" and "securing the border".'
p11654
aS'Watching this unfold, I was reminded of those dueling protests in my district three years ago, when I shook my head wondering how one group of people could call my proposal amnesty for illegal immigrants while another described the very same proposal as a step backward for illegal immigrants.'
p11655
aS'I fear we are on the verge of the same thing happening again.'
p11656
aS'Each day that passes without a deal increases the likelihood that Washington will ultimately do what it usually does: keep the status quo.'
p11657
aS'At best, this would entail Congress authorizing the current DACA program with the same two-year renewals and uncertainty for Dreamers.'
p11658
aS'In the meantime, Democrats and Republicans would continue to fight over border security with little or no progress to show for it.'
p11659
aS'While keeping the status quo would protect the Dreamers from immediate deportation, it would represent a missed opportunity of tremendous proportions for them, for border security and for broader immigration reform.'
p11660
aS'It is well past time for Republicans to stand up to those on the right who are quick to denounce any sensible solution as amnesty and for Democrats to stand up to those on the left who rail against any meaningful steps toward border security and immigration enforcement.'
p11661
aS'The fate of the Dreamers presents a unique opportunity for both parties to do just that.'
p11662
aS'If they do, we may well look back on this as the beginning of the end of the immigration wars.'
p11663
aS'Donald Trump almost never laughs.'
p11664

aS'It would be easy to dismiss this as a personality quirk.'
p11667
aS'Some people are just hard laughs.'
p11668
aS'Perhaps Mr. Trump is simply the hardest laugh of all.'
p11669
aS'But the president\xe2\x80\x99s laughter, or lack thereof, is a window into the way he views the world\xe2\x80\x99s most difficult job.'
p11670
aS'For the first time in recent memory, we have a commander in chief without a sense of humor \xe2\x80\x94 and America is paying the price.'
p11671
aS'For most presidents, humor is a tool for building bridges, especially with voters who may not be persuaded by their policy goals.'
p11672
aS'When I wrote speeches for President Barack Obama, we would often open with a throwaway line, something about sports, the weather or the best barbecue joint in town.'
p11673
aS'These were not exactly comedy gold.'
p11674
aS'Still, they served a purpose.'
p11675

p11676
aS'The presidential equivalent of dad jokes \xe2\x80\x94 safe, well-placed quips that crowds are well primed to laugh at \xe2\x80\x94 are a bipartisan Oval Office tradition.'
p11677
aS'Presidents George W. Bush, Bill Clinton and especially Ronald Reagan knew how to use laugh lines to win over skeptics.'
p11678
aS'On his way into the operating room after a 1981 assassination attempt, Mr. Reagan famously declared to his doctors, "Please tell me you\xe2\x80\x99re all Republicans".'
p11679
aS'The head surgeon, a Democrat, replied, "We\xe2\x80\x99re all Republicans today".'
p11680
aS'Even at that moment, the president deftly cleared a patch of common ground.'
p11681
aS'Mr. Trump, to put it mildly, lacks this ability.'
p11682
aS'With no talent for gracious one-liners, he finds himself ill at ease in front of all but the most adoring audiences.'
p11683
aS'This is not to say that he is without charisma.'
p11684
aS'The difference lies in the way his charisma is deployed.'
p11685
aS'Surrounded by followers at rallies, he uses his well-honed sense of timing as a cudgel.'
p11686
aS'He jeers.'
p11687
aS'He mocks.'
p11688
aS'His goal is to insult, rather than to entertain.'
p11689
aS'It should come as no surprise, then, that Mr. Trump governs the way he delivers a punch line: consolidating support among the hard core while alienating everybody else.'
p11690
aS'It\xe2\x80\x99s not only in front of a crowd that laughter matters.'
p11691
aS'Whether in public or in private, politicians use humor to identify, and ultimately to uphold, unwritten norms.'
p11692
aS'This is best explained using what the University of Colorado, Boulder\xe2\x80\x99s Peter McGraw, founder of the Humor Research Lab, has called "benign violation theory".'
p11693
aS'We laugh when something breaks one of life\xe2\x80\x99s many rules.'
p11694
aS'This is why, at the White House Correspondents\xe2\x80\x99 dinner, President Obama could chastise Republicans for failing to reach beyond their base ("Call me self-centered, but I can think of one minority they could start with"), or pretend to lose his cool over climate change deniers as "Luther, my anger translator" tried and failed to calm him down.'
p11695
aS'By stepping up to the line without crossing it, a commander in chief tacitly acknowledges that a line exists.'
p11696
aS'President Trump does not possess the sense of nuance a well-told joke requires.'
p11697
aS'He does not seem to know when he is pushing the envelope.'
p11698
aS'Even worse, he does not appear to realize that there   an envelope.'
p11699
aS'It\xe2\x80\x99s one thing, for example, to do an end-run around Washington reporters by appearing on "Between Two Ferns" to promote your health care bill.'
p11700
aS'It\xe2\x80\x99s another thing entirely to mock a disabled journalist or to suggest that Megyn Kelly asked a tough question because she had "blood coming out of her wherever".'
p11701
aS'This refusal to recognize the unwritten rules that govern us, so evident during Mr. Trump\xe2\x80\x99s failed attempts at humor, is a central feature of his presidential tenure thus far.'
p11702
aS'If a leader does not understand the idea of benign violations, blatant violations inevitably occur.'
p11703
aS'Humor helps us recognize, and cope with, life\xe2\x80\x99s absurdities.'
p11704
aS'While I certainly never asked him directly, I got the sense Mr. Obama appreciated that the modern American presidency is in many ways a fundamentally bizarre proposition.'
p11705
aS'Commanders in chief must accept the responsibilities that come with holding the fate of the world at their fingertips, while simultaneously admitting that they are only human.'
p11706
aS'Presidents can either laugh at the strangeness of their circumstances or be consumed by them.'
p11707
aS'Without the qualities that laughter both demonstrates and fosters \xe2\x80\x94 a willingness to find common ground, the respect for agreed-upon norms and the awareness that we are all only human \xe2\x80\x94 Mr. Trump\xe2\x80\x99s attitude toward the presidency is defined by the one characteristic that remains: a lust for power.'
p11708
aS'And this is perhaps the most troubling thing about what passes for a sense of humor with Mr. Trump.'
p11709
aS'Thanks to the power of the internet, there is proof that our president has indeed laughed at least once.'
p11710
aS'This was during a campaign rally in January, when Mr. Trump\xe2\x80\x99s speech was interrupted by a barking dog.'
p11711
aS'"It\xe2\x80\x99s Hillary"!'
p11712
aS'an audience member shouted.'
p11713
aS'And the candidate tilted his head back, opened his mouth wide and laughed without reservation, quite possibly for the first time in his political life.'
p11714
aS'This documented incidence of Trump laughter is as illuminating as all the grim smiles that preceded it.'
p11715
aS'For they reveal a president who is constantly, endlessly preoccupied with status.'
p11716
aS'A craving for power isn\xe2\x80\x99t unique to the politician currently holding the Oval Office \xe2\x80\x94 on the contrary, it is more or less a requirement for entry into the field.'
p11717
aS'But a craving   for power is.'
p11718
aS'It is not too late to undo the damage our humorless president is causing to American democracy.'
p11719
aS'Democrats (and some Republicans, these days) are already thinking about who might replace him in 2020.'
p11720
aS'And if there is one thing all Americans should be able to agree on, it is this: Whomever we nominate to replace President Trump, it is time to put an easy laugh back on top of the ticket.'
p11721
aS'When I was 21, I went into the office of a producer of the television show I was starring in to discuss a big problem.'
p11722
aS'By this point I had been acting for more than a decade, and the show was very successful and beloved.'
p11723
aS'Still, I was nervous about facing the firing squad of Emmys that sat behind him and saying what I had to say.'
p11724
aS'A crew member had kept showing up to my apartment after work unannounced, going into my trailer while I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t in it, and staring daggers at me from across the set.'
p11725

p11726
aS'He was very sweet and kind in the beginning.'
p11727
aS'We flirted a bit on set.'
p11728
aS'But I was in a relationship.'
p11729
aS'And liking someone certainly didn\xe2\x80\x99t merit the kind of behavior he was exhibiting, which was making me feel unsafe.'
p11730
aS'My hands were freezing and I balled my wardrobe skirt up around my fists as I spoke.'
p11731
aS'It was all caught in my throat \xe2\x80\x94 my embarrassment that it had gotten to this point.'
p11732
aS'The producer listened.'
p11733
aS'Then he said, "Well, there are two sides to every story".'
p11734
aS'For women in America who come forward with stories of harassment, abuse and sexual assault, there are not two sides to every story, however noble that principle might seem.'
p11735
aS'Women do not get to have a side.'
p11736
aS'They get to have an interrogation.'
p11737
aS'Too often, they are questioned mercilessly about whether their side is legitimate.'
p11738

aS'That happened this past week when a conversation about my friend Armie Hammer\xe2\x80\x99s forthcoming film \xe2\x80\x94 in which a 24-year-old and 17-year-old have a relationship \xe2\x80\x94 escalated, as things can on Twitter, I guess, into a discussion with the actor James Woods about what is appropriate behavior in terms of an adult dating someone underage.'
p11758
aS'Mr. Woods spoke critically, if flippantly, of the story depicted in the film.'

aS'In August 1965, a resolute President Lyndon Johnson said: "America wins the wars that she undertakes. Make no mistake about it".'
p11789
aS'But the strategy on which he committed America to its ill-fated intervention in Vietnam that year did not aim at winning, but at not losing.'
p11790
aS'McGeorge Bundy, Johnson\xe2\x80\x99s national security adviser, later admitted as much to a biographer, saying that he had personally approved a strategy that used just enough military pressure to achieve a battlefield stalemate, which "would eventually compel the Vietnamese Communists to compromise their objectives," forcing them to the negotiating table or to a Korea-style armistice.'
p11791
aS'Bundy added that his strategy rested, in hindsight, on "little more than an unexamined assumption".'
p11792
aS'The same might be said of President Trump\xe2\x80\x99s newest policy on Afghanistan.'
p11793
aS'Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said that the strategy, which commits a few thousand more troops, was "intended to put pressure on the Taliban".'
p11794
aS'The idea, he said, was "to have the Taliban understand, you will not win a battlefield victory \xe2\x80\x94 we may not win one, but neither will you \xe2\x80\x94 so at some point, we have to come to the negotiating table and find a way to bring this to an end".'
p11795
aS'There are two great lessons of Vietnam that the Trump administration might bear in mind before attempting to reprise the stalemate strategy that so conspicuously failed in the earlier conflict.'
p11796
aS'The first was formulated by a rueful Bundy, many years after the end of the Vietnam War: "We ought not to ever be in a position where we are deciding, or undertaking to decide, or even trying to influence the internal power structure" of another country, he told his biographer, Gordon M. Goldstein.'
p11797
aS'George Kennan, the historian and former diplomat, came to the same conclusion long before Bundy.'
p11798
aS'In the Fulbright hearings on Vietnam in February 1966, he stated, "Our country should not be asked, and should not ask of itself, to shoulder the main burden of determining the political realities in any other country".'
p11799
aS'Did President Trump learn that lesson?'
p11800
aS'We are not nation-building again.'
p11801
aS'In his Aug. 21 speech announcing the policy, he said: "We are a partner and a friend, but we will not dictate to the Afghan people how to live or how to govern their own complex society. We are killing terrorists".'
p11802
aS'But actions matter more than words, and a strategy based on an indefinite stalemate requires precisely what Mr. Trump says he rejects: propping up an Afghan government that cannot survive unaided for a prolonged period of time.'
p11803
aS'And in fact, nation-building is exactly what America is doing in Afghanistan, as the foreign policy expert   to the country.'
p11804
aS'Only instead of "nation-building," he heard commanders use terms like "capacity-building," "enabling" and "working by, through and with".'
p11805
aS'One could hark back to the hopeful reports of democracy-building in Vietnam in 1967, as President Nguyen Van Thieu began consolidating his military-based rule with a flawed election, carried out mainly at the insistence of the United States.'
p11806
aS'This brings us to the second lesson of Vietnam, articulated by Henry Kissinger at the end of 1968 in a famous Foreign Affairs essay: A denial strategy cannot in itself produce victory, especially in a conflict involving insurgents.'
p11807
aS'"We fought a military war; our opponents fought a political one," he wrote.'
p11808
aS'In the process we lost sight of one of the cardinal maxims of guerrilla war: The guerrilla wins if he does not lose.'
p11809
aS'"We sought physical attrition; our opponents aimed for our psychological exhaustion. The conventional army loses if it does not win".'
p11810
aS'Many years later, Mr. Kissinger, who became Richard Nixon\xe2\x80\x99s national security adviser, connected this conclusion with an additional point: America\xe2\x80\x99s inability to "win" in Vietnam by producing a decisive outcome rendered the stalemate strategy of "not losing" ineffective.'
p11811
aS'He no doubt took pleasure in ascribing the fallacy to his rival and predecessor, Bundy.'
p11812
aS'"Stalemate violates the maxim that the guerrilla wins if he does not lose," Mr. Kissinger told Newsweek in 2008.'
p11813
aS'"Hanoi\xe2\x80\x99s leaders had fought a decade against France and battled the United States for a similar length of time, not to achieve a political compromise, but to prevail".'
p11814
aS'In other words, a stalemate strategy against an ideologically motivated, insurgent-driven enemy is doomed to fail.'
p11815
aS'There\xe2\x80\x99s a corollary: Stalemate strategies that don\xe2\x80\x99t show rapid progress will soon eat away at public and domestic political support.'
p11816
aS'Indeed, by 1967 the news media and a growing number of politicians were debating whether or not the Vietnam War was stalemated \xe2\x80\x94 overlooking, or disregarding, the fact that this was precisely the Johnson administration\xe2\x80\x99s goal.'
p11817
aS'Nor was it simply a matter of bad communication: Stalemate might have made sense to Bundy, but no one in the White House or Pentagon thought it made for good P.R. And so even as the White House and the Pentagon pursued a stalemate strategy in Vietnam, at home they insisted that progress toward a conventional victory was close at hand.'
p11818
aS'Gen. William Westmoreland, who oversaw the American war effort from Saigon, was brought back to Washington twice in 1967 to reassure Congress and the American people.'
p11819
aS'But his promotional efforts served only to amplify the shock of the Tet offensive in early 1968, which led Walter Cronkite, after a visit to Vietnam during the fighting, to announce, "To say that we are mired in stalemate seems the only realistic, if unsatisfactory conclusion".'
p11820
aS'This same disconnect in strategy, rhetoric and reality confronts us today.'
p11821
aS'If stalemate and nation-building are the goals in Afghanistan, but the American public is led to expect a victory, then it is only a matter of time before the entire edifice collapses.'
p11822
aS'And when it does, we might face the same conclusion that Cronkite drew after touring Vietnam: "It is increasingly clear to this reporter that the only rational way out then will be to negotiate, not as victors, but as an honorable people who lived up to their pledge to defend democracy, and did the best they could".'

"This will be the largest audience to witness an Emmys period," he announced in faux seriousness, "both in person and around the world".

And Ahmed became the first Asian man to win an acting Emmy for his role in "The Night Of," for which he won best actor in a limited series or movie. A \'9 TO 5\' REUNION BECOMES A TRUMP ROAST Perhaps the most biting Trump commentary came, unexpectedly, from the crowd-pleasing reunion of Dolly Parton, Fonda and Tomlin, stars of the 1980 hit movie "9 to 5". Fonda declared that back then, the women refused "to be controlled by a sexist, egotistical, lying, hypocritical bigot" (their boss in the film. ) To which Tomlin quickly added, to huge cheers: "In 2017 we STILL refuse to be controlled by a sexist, egotistical, lying hypocritical bigot". Parton, for her part, chose to joke about her hope of getting a "Grace & Frankie" vibrator in her swag bag.

"Bring women to the front of their own stories," Witherspoon said. "More great roles for women, please"! )  The winning shows in the other two major categories also featured women\'s stories: "The Handmaid\'s Tale," and "Veep".

aS'What Rodgers wants us to do I\'m going to do," Howell said. "I\'m in support of peaceful protest". Teresa Beardsley, a Bears fan from Frankfort, Ind., said she would stand with her hand over her heart "because that\xe2\x80\x99s who I am". Kendricks said the team saw signs in the stands against the Bengals that told protesting players to leave the organization".'

p12615
aS'This was extremely frustrating and at times upsetting.'

aS'At those times I had to think of the purpose of the whole project rather than what would feel good right then and there.'
p12617
aS'Part of the problem with challenging these people\xe2\x80\x99s views is that often they are not arrived at logically, so it is hard to reason them out of them.'
p12618
aS'Their worldview is deeply conspiratorial, so straight facts often won\xe2\x80\x99t work.'
p12619
aS'Some of them reach their views because of fear or anger, so we need to find a way to speak to them on an emotional level, not merely a rational and factual level.'
p12620
aS'However, by the time people get that far into these movements, it is extremely hard to change their minds.'
p12621

aS'I\xe2\x80\x99m not an expert on the Islamic State so I can\xe2\x80\x99t comment on it specifically.'
p12623
aS'In one sense, of course, it is a fundamentally different type of threat driven by its own set of complex causes and we don\xe2\x80\x99t want to oversimplify either phenomenon.'
p12624
aS'However, there are some obvious parallels especially in regard to young men being driven by anger or fear to join extreme movements.'

aS'The funding of the alt-right is a fascinating question.'
p12627
aS'Some are clearly independently wealthy, like  , and I\xe2\x80\x99m sure there are rich people providing help in different ways.'
p12628
aS'However, much of the movement is crowdfunded.'
p12629
aS'They have crowdfunding sites like Hatreon where they get money for projects or individual events.'
p12630
aS'Recently, for example, a group of European "Identitarians" linked to the alt-right raised more than $200,000 to charter a ship to hamper the efforts of organizations working with migrants trying to cross the Mediterranean to Europe.'
p12631
aS'This money was raised around the world via crowdfunding.'
p12632
aS'In one way, this shows the scale of the alt-right.'
p12633
aS'I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid I fundamentally reject the premise of this question on several fronts.'
p12634
aS'First, it\xe2\x80\x99s based on the premise that ethnic groups have an "entitlement" to certain pieces of land.'
p12635
aS'Ethnic groups have moved around the globe for millenniums so when exactly did this become static and certain ethnic groups became "entitled" to certain bits of the planet?'
p12636
aS'Second, you state that Europeans "face a moral obligation to turn themselves into ethnic minorities".'
p12637
aS'Where is this the case?'
p12638
aS'This is the sort of spurious demographic nonsense the alt-right uses all the time.'
p12639
aS':  If people have fears and concerns it is important we listen to them, as simply ignoring them will compound the problem.'
p12640
aS'However, we must also be extremely firm toward those who seek to manipulate and use those concerns and fears to advance prejudiced political agendas.'
p12641
aS'This is what much of the alt-right does.'
p12642
aS':  This is such an important point and it is often hugely overlooked.'
p12643
aS'The Hope Not Hate report looks at the importance of anti-feminism, gender and masculinity to the alt-right.'
p12644
aS'It is central to the worldview of the alt-right.'
p12645
aS'The international alt-right has, at its core, the explicit rejection of equality and the pursuit of identity and status for white men who feel aggrieved.'
p12646
aS'As you suggest, one part is racism and the belief that white people overall are threatened by multiculturalism.'
p12647
aS'But more specifically   are those they consider repressed.'
p12648
aS'The alt-right believes the world should be ordered into strict hierarchies.'
p12649
aS'That includes the belief that strict traditional gender roles are natural.'
p12650
aS'Therefore, they fight against what they think is the emasculating effect of feminism.'
p12651
aS'The alternative right is, to a large part, an online movement and much of it is organized on online forums \xe2\x80\x94 already male-dominated spaces.'
p12652
aS'There, misogyny can function as a pep talk that helps empower men who feel disempowered.'
p12653
aS'See Jack Donovan, who advocates the retreat of men into ethnic tribal "brotherhoods".'
p12654
aS'Online or offline, the sense of camaraderie fostered in male spaces allows men to validate one another as men; it\xe2\x80\x99s an incredibly powerful feeling for those who would otherwise be isolated.'
p12655
aS'This is an important question and one that many have asked.'
p12656
aS'The reason that Hope Not Hate uses undercover research and asks people like me to spend long periods inside far-right movements is not to just catch racist people saying racist things.'
p12657
aS'Of course, in some cases far-right people and organizations cloak their true extremism and portray a more moderate image to the world to try to avoid criticism and gain new supporters.'
p12658
aS'Going undercover allows us to expose this.'
p12659
aS'However, more important is understanding how a far-right movement operates, organizes and functions.'
p12660
aS'This is invaluable for finding the most effective strategies for opposing and undermining them.'
p12661
aS'I spent hundreds of hours with these people and came away with a real understanding of what drives their activism, the tactics they seek to use, and what they were planning to do.'
p12662
aS'This allows Hope Not Hate to always be one step ahead, and to plan responses and opposition earlier than anyone else.'
p12663
aS'Terminology is a constant discussion when you\xe2\x80\x99re looking at the far right.'
p12664
aS'It\xe2\x80\x99s really important not to just call everyone a Nazi.'
p12665
aS'You can\xe2\x80\x99t defeat what you don\xe2\x80\x99t understand, and just writing off everyone you disagree with as a Nazi shows a lack of analysis.'
p12666
aS'Of course, if someone is a Nazi, then call him a Nazi.'
p12667
aS'I fully understand why people want to avoid the term alt-right, and there is no doubt that some have adopted it with a view to sanitizing their image.'
p12668
aS'This is why it is important not to be inaccurate and allow the far right to self-label.'
p12669
aS'However, while "alt-right" is a very broad and imperfect term, and there are large areas of crossover with the traditional far right and neo-Nazis, there are also differences, especially around the culture of the movement and its means of operating.'
p12670
aS'It remains a useful and necessary term.'
p12671
aS'I went to my first Kansas City Chiefs football game in December 2010, six months after my father, Army Col. John McHugh,   by a suicide bomber in Kabul, Afghanistan.'
p12672

aS'yelled a woman behind us who sported red-and-yellow face paint and seemed drunk herself.'
p12679
aS'Once the band finally reached the end of the song, instead of singing "home of the brave," the entire stadium screamed "home of the Chiefs"!'
p12680
aS'They had replaced "brave" \xe2\x80\x94 a word that, to me, represented my father, a man who spent 24 years in the military and gave his life for the country \xe2\x80\x94 with a mascot.'
p12681
aS'My blood boiled.'
p12682
aS'"They do it at every game," my boyfriend at the time whispered to me.'

p12686
aS'At my first Wildcat football game in Bill Snyder Family Stadium, as I barely held myself together during the national anthem, the purple clad K-State fans shouted "Chiefs" in place of "brave".'

aS'Again, my blood boiled.'
p12689
aS'When it comes to "disrespecting the national anthem," people have been doing it for a long time.'
p12690
aS'They do it because they\xe2\x80\x99re drunk or because it\xe2\x80\x99s tradition or because they just spent $200 on tickets and they are pumped to be in a stadium alongside tens of thousands of other fans.'
p12691
aS'I worked in both professional and collegiate athletics for five years, and in both venues, I never felt like "The Star-Spangled Banner" got the respect it deserved.'
p12692
aS'To the average fan, I observed, it was just something to get through before the main event.'
p12693
aS'So, I\xe2\x80\x99m surprised at the number of white people on my Facebook feed who are offended because black football players are kneeling for the national anthem.'
p12694
aS'As a Gold Star daughter \xe2\x80\x94 and, to be clear, I am not speaking for all Gold Star families \xe2\x80\x94 I\xe2\x80\x99m not offended by what is happening in the N.F.L. right now.'
p12695
aS'At least these players are "disrespecting" the national anthem for a cause.'
p12696
aS'Not once during these peaceful protests have I gotten the sense that the players\xe2\x80\x99 intention is to disrespect the military.'
p12697

p12698
aS'Rather, they were exercising the exact freedoms my father gave his life for.'
p12699
aS'Protests are not supposed to be comfortable.'
p12700
aS'They are supposed to incite change \xe2\x80\x94 and what these players are doing is working.'

p12702
aS'Whether it offends you or not, this is what a successful protest looks like.'
p12703
aS'Someone I know on Facebook wrote this: Sure these "spoiled babies" (words I pulled from a different Facebook post) could do other things to make statements, like donate money to causes or maybe make a statement in a news conference.'
p12704
aS'(By the way, they\xe2\x80\x99ve been doing these things for a long time already.'

p12770
aS'Such measures would satisfy pressure on the Iraqi federal government from its Arab and non-Kurdish communities to check Kurdish expansionism and also help pacify Turkish and Iranian worries about instability.'

aS'But they will not answer the longer-term questions about Iraqi Kurdish aspirations for independence or the fate of Kirkuk.'
p12772

p12853
aS'Thinking that would make for an easy conversation starter, I messaged him.'
p12854
aS'A few minutes later, he replied, but instead of responding to my reptilian inquiry, he asked, "Are you in a wheelchair"?'

aS'I kept my answer simple and told him that yes, I do use a wheelchair, but I was much more interested in the back story of the iguana.'
p12856
aS'Unfortunately, he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t interested at all, messaging back only to say: "Sorry. The wheelchair\xe2\x80\x99s a deal-breaker for me".'
p12857
aS'His blunt reply stung, but the feeling was nothing new.'
p12858
aS'Because I was born with my disability \xe2\x80\x94 Larsen syndrome, a genetic joint and muscle disorder \xe2\x80\x94 I\xe2\x80\x99d already gathered a pile of romantic rejections seemingly big enough to fill an Olympic swimming pool by the time I downloaded Tinder.'
p12859
aS'This particular rejection, however, unleashed a wave of panic within me.'

p12862
aS'When I found myself newly single, I turned to online dating in the hopes of easing my fears that no one else would ever accept me as I am, that lightning doesn\xe2\x80\x99t strike twice.'
p12863
aS'Not one to be deterred, I persevered, downloading every possible dating app and creating accounts on various dating sites.'
p12864
aS'But I became skittish about revealing my disability, because in an already shallow dating culture, I believed my wheelchair would cause most men to write me off without a second thought.'
p12865
aS'So I decided to hide my disability completely.'
p12866
aS'I cropped my wheelchair out of my photos.'
p12867
aS'I eliminated any mention of it in my profiles.'
p12868
aS'In this virtual world, I could pretend my disability didn\xe2\x80\x99t exist.'
p12869
aS'I kept up with this facade for a while, messaging matches who were none the wiser.'
p12870
aS'Once I thought I\xe2\x80\x99d spoken with a guy long enough to establish his interest, I\xe2\x80\x99d choose a moment to strike, telling him about my disability.'
p12871
aS'I\xe2\x80\x99d send a long-winded explanation divulging my wheelchair use, reminding him that it didn\xe2\x80\x99t make me any less of person and ending with reassurance that he could ask me questions, should he have any.'
p12872
aS'After dropping the "wheelchair bomb," I\xe2\x80\x99d have to brace myself for their reactions, which were always a mixed bag, often ranging from indifference to ghosting.'
p12873
aS'Occasionally, I\xe2\x80\x99d receive an accepting response.'
p12874
aS'One man that I connected with on Coffee Meets Bagel was incredibly apologetic when I first told him about my wheelchair, as though it was the most tragic thing he\xe2\x80\x99d ever heard.'
p12875
aS'I shut that down by explaining that my disability is part of who I am and it\xe2\x80\x99s nothing to be sorry for.'
p12876
aS'I ended up going on one date with him, and then another.'
p12877
aS'For the second date, my bagel suggested a painting night (a social event that involves paintbrushes, canvases, acrylics and, usually, wine) since I\xe2\x80\x99d told him how much I enjoy them.'
p12878
aS'He found a Groupon and I researched a location, picking out a restaurant in New York City that was supposed to be wheelchair accessible.'
p12879
aS'As it turned out, the restaurant was accessible, but the painting class was happening in a room upstairs.'
p12880
aS'So, we spent our entire date sitting directly below the painters, eating dinner and making strained conversation with wine-fueled laughter and painting instruction in the background.'
p12881
aS'I was mortified.'
p12882
aS'Following that disaster, I promised my date I\xe2\x80\x99d get his money back.'
p12883
aS'As soon as the company refunded our tickets, I never heard from him again.'
p12884
aS'It was painful to realize that the hard part isn\xe2\x80\x99t over once someone learns that I\xe2\x80\x99m disabled.'
p12885
aS'Going on dates with me can be a crash course on disability, and I recognize that\xe2\x80\x99s not always easy for non-disabled people to process.'
p12886
aS'But I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t helping the situation by keeping the existence of my disability concealed, springing it upon people only when I thought it felt right.'
p12887
aS'In retrospect, this served only to contribute to the stigma I usually work so hard to fight.'
p12888
aS'I felt like a hypocrite.'
p12889
aS'In every other area of my life, my disability is front and center.'
p12890
aS'I write and speak endlessly about being a proud, unapologetic disabled woman.'
p12891
aS'It is part of my identity, shaping everything I do and everything I value.'
p12892
aS'But in the online dating world, my disability was my secret shame.'
p12893
aS'So I decided it was time for a change.'
p12894
aS'I started gradually, making references to my disability throughout my profile, then adding photos in which my wheelchair is clearly visible.'
p12895
aS'I tried to keep things light and humorous.'
p12896
aS'For instance, OKCupid asks users to list six things they can\xe2\x80\x99t live without; one of mine is "the invention of the wheel".'
p12897
aS'Still, I found myself having to make sure that potential matches had actually picked up on the trail of clues I\xe2\x80\x99d left.'
p12898
aS'I grew tired of feeling like I needed to deceive men into being interested because society instilled in me that my disability makes me undesirable.'
p12899
aS'Finally, I took the leap I\xe2\x80\x99d been so afraid to make, opening up about disability to strangers whom I hoped would appreciate my honesty and perhaps send me a message.'
p12900
aS'My disability is part of my identity and I\xe2\x80\x99m a loud, proud disability rights activist, but there is so much more that defines me (you know, like the stuff I\xe2\x80\x99ve got in my profile).'
p12901
aS'I realize some people are hesitant to date a human who experiences the world sitting down.'
p12902
aS'But I\xe2\x80\x99d like to think you\xe2\x80\x99ll keep reading and dive a little deeper.'
p12903
aS'Prominently in my profile, I wrote: "I\xe2\x80\x99d like to be very upfront about the fact that I use a wheelchair. And you\xe2\x80\x99re welcome to ask questions, should you have any".'
p12904
aS'Once I added that paragraph, I felt liberated, relieved that anyone I spoke to would have a clearer picture of me.'
p12905
aS'There have been plenty of matches that haven\xe2\x80\x99t worked out, and whether that\xe2\x80\x99s actually because of my disability, I\xe2\x80\x99ll never know.'
p12906
aS'But I had a nearly yearlong relationship with a man I met through OKCupid, so I know it\xe2\x80\x99s possible for lightning to strike again.'
p12907
aS'My dating life remains a comedy of errors, and I still struggle every day with the feeling that my disability means I won\xe2\x80\x99t find love, but at least I\xe2\x80\x99m being true to myself.'
p12908
aS'I\xe2\x80\x99m putting myself out there \xe2\x80\x94 my whole self \xe2\x80\x94 and it feels good to be proud of who I am.'

p12956
aS'When I began working in the Pentagon during President Jimmy Carter\xe2\x80\x99s administration, there was an unspoken but unmistakable assumption: If you were Jewish, you could not work on the Middle East because you would be biased.'

aS'And yet, I remember well the time in 1990, when I was the head of the State Department\xe2\x80\x99s policy planning staff, I was visited by a diplomatic security investigator who was doing a background check on someone who had listed me as a reference.'

aS'This person was being considered for a senior position in the George H. W. Bush administration, not one directly involved with the Middle East.'

aS'I asked, even though I realized I might not be helping the person using me as a reference.'

aS'He answered, "Because he is Jewish".'
p12976
aS'So I went on: If he was Irish and had to work on problems related to Ireland or if he was Italian and had to work on Italy, would you ask that question?'
p12977
aS'Initially, the investigator did not seem to know how to respond, but then I saw a look of recognition.'
p12978
aS'He suddenly realized that I was Jewish.'
p12979
aS'And, at that point, he changed the subject.'

aS'It is just as unacceptable.'

p13006
aS'The company describes Free Basics as an "on ramp" that introduces the internet to people in the developing world.'

p13008
aS'The three-year-old app is available to hundreds of millions of mobile phone users in more than 60 countries.'
p13009
aS'Bringing more people online is a noble goal.'
p13010
aS'About 50 percent of the world\xe2\x80\x99s population \xe2\x80\x94 mainly people in developing countries, women in particular \xe2\x80\x94 is still not online.'
p13011
aS'Internet affordability remains staggeringly unequal across the globe: In Africa in 2015, one gigabyte of data cost more than 17 percent of the average person\xe2\x80\x99s income, while in the Europe and United States, it cost less than 1 percent.'
p13012
aS'But there is no hard evidence that Free Basics is connecting people who would otherwise be cut off from the internet.'
p13013
aS'And the millions of people who do use the free Facebook portal are experiencing something quite distinct from the open internet: Free Basics is a closed space where Facebook picks the content \xe2\x80\x94 and profits from users\xe2\x80\x99 data along the way \xe2\x80\x94 creating what some people call a " ".'
p13014
aS'The head of Facebook, Mark Zuckerberg, has responded to these criticisms by saying, "It is always better to have some access than none at all".'
p13015
aS'A study by the Alliance for Affordable Internet found that most Free Basics customers had used the internet before they began using Free Basics.'
p13016
aS'This and other studies suggest that a large proportion of Free Basics users see the app as a way to get extra free time on Facebook \xe2\x80\x94 a way to stay connected with their Facebook friends without using up their data plans \xe2\x80\x94 and not as an "on ramp" to the web.'
p13017
aS'Facebook does not appear to be introducing people to the open internet, but it is making it easy for people who can afford smartphones and data plans to spend unlimited time in the company\xe2\x80\x99s closed, for-profit environment.'
p13018
aS'One reason Free Basics may be missing the mark is that a mobile phone app isn\xe2\x80\x99t a good way to get poor people online.'
p13019
aS'In rural areas, people are often disconnected because their region lacks cables, towers or a signal, rendering a mobile app useless.'

aS'Researchers testing the app in six countries found that more than half of the websites on the app\xe2\x80\x99s main screen belong to big companies like ESPN, Johnson & Johnson and Disney.'
p13024
aS'Free Basics typically features some news sites (usually BBC and one or two national daily newspapers) and sites dedicated to things like finance and health care.'
p13025
aS'But, at best, a user can see only about 150 websites, all of which are selected either by Facebook or by site operators.'
p13026
aS'Free Basics users cannot see video.'
p13027
aS'Many photos are removed.'
p13028
aS'And if they want to click a link to explore an issue further, they can rarely do so.'
p13029
aS'The unclickable links, unloadable videos and paltry supply of websites all appear to be part of an effort to minimize the cost of data traveling through the network.'
p13030
aS'Perhaps those limitations do keep costs down \xe2\x80\x94 and make it possible for the service to be free \xe2\x80\x94 but this technical design also helps benefit Facebook\xe2\x80\x99s bottom line.'
p13031
aS'It keeps users in a confined space, where the company can monitor and analyze their habits for profit.'
p13032
aS'Whenever users click a website in Free Basics, that click sends packets of data to Facebook\xe2\x80\x99s servers.'
p13033
aS'The company collects information about the websites that users visit, and other data like their phone numbers.'
p13034
aS'This is no small matter.'

aS'But the Arab Spring uprisings rattled the U.A.E. leaders\xe2\x80\x99 confidence in their own ability to stay in power, and a repressive turn prioritizing security over cultural capital followed.'
p13315
aS'In March 2011, as the popular revolts spread through the region, more than 100 activists in the U.A.E. signed a   calling for direct elections and reform of the country\xe2\x80\x99s toothless Parliament.'
p13316
aS'Many of those who signed the document were prosecuted, stripped of their citizenship or subsequently deported.'
p13317
aS'Academics also came under assault.'
p13318
aS'In the summer of 2012, Matt Duffy, a journalism professor at Zayed University in Abu Dhabi, was abruptly   and forced to leave the U.A.E. after he criticized media restrictions in the country.'
p13319
aS'In March 2015, Andrew Ross, an N.Y.U. professor who specializes in labor issues, was   from traveling to Abu Dhabi for unspecified security reasons.'
p13320
aS'Mr. Ross, who was an outspoken critic of the university\xe2\x80\x99s Abu Dhabi project and especially the abuse of migrant laborers in the emirates, had planned to spend his spring break researching labor conditions.'
p13321
aS'The university\xe2\x80\x99s response was tepid and cowardly.'
p13322
aS'A spokesman argued that "it is the government that controls visa and immigration policy, and not the university".'
p13323
aS'The university and other Western intellectual and cultural institutions, including the Sorbonne and the Louvre and Guggenheim museums, that made deals to open branches in Abu Dhabi have failed to adjust to the new reality: A more repressive security apparatus was shaping the priorities of their local partner and benefactor.'
p13324
aS'It is ironic that I supported the Abu Dhabi project when it started, and I wanted it to succeed, despite the limitations.'
p13325
aS'I still think the project has merits: The students being recruited to the campus \xe2\x80\x94 representing over 100 nationalities, and many receiving full scholarships underwritten by Abu Dhabi \xe2\x80\x94 are exceptional.'
p13326
aS'When N.Y.U.\xe2\x80\x99s leadership first announced the project, some students, faculty and trustees were worried that the U.A.E. would deny entry to Jews, gays and other groups that the Gulf leadership might find objectionable.'
p13327
aS'But those apprehensions were based on an outdated understanding of the Gulf states and their fears.'
p13328
aS'By the time the project was underway, Abu Dhabi considered Iran\xe2\x80\x99s regional influence to be the greatest threat to its security.'
p13329
aS'In the view of Gulf leaders, the Iran danger lurks everywhere, and Arab and Persian Shiites alike (even American citizens) are potential fifth columnists, who can infiltrate their societies to advance Iran\xe2\x80\x99s interests.'
p13330
aS'N.Y.U. officials have provided very few details on their deal with Abu Dhabi, admitting only that the emirate   the university an initial $50 million grant \xe2\x80\x94 a good-will gift negotiated by Mr. Sexton.'
p13331
aS'N.Y.U. administrators provided data to a faculty committee showing that from 2009 to 2016, the Abu Dhabi authorities approved 97 percent of visa applications by faculty, students and staff.'
p13332
aS'The data show that 10 faculty applications, out of 863, were rejected.'
p13333
aS'If N.Y.U. continues to accept Abu Dhabi\xe2\x80\x99s largess, it needs to acknowledge the limitations that the emirate\xe2\x80\x99s security and foreign policies impose on academic freedom.'
p13334
aS'At the very least, the university should admit that it has bought into a political system that actively discriminates against members of a religious minority because of an overwhelming fear of Iran and hatred of Shiites.'
p13335
aS'This is far from the free movement of people and ideas to which N.Y.U.\xe2\x80\x99s leaders claim to aspire.'
p13336
aS'One spring afternoon, Samantha Coleman\xe2\x80\x99s two daughters ran across the family\xe2\x80\x99s yard, chasing dozens of newly hatched chicks.'
p13337
aS'Coleman, 28, ran after them.'
p13338
aS'"Whoa! Child down," she called, reaching to pick up her 2-year-old, who had managed to fall into a bush.'
p13339
aS'"This is my life," Coleman said, laughing.'

aS'"But I\xe2\x80\x99m good".'
p13343
aS'Sometimes this still surprises her.'
p13344
aS'Four years ago, things looked very different: Coleman was using heroin, was in a violent relationship and risked losing her older daughter to foster care.'
p13345
aS'In most places, a parent in Coleman\xe2\x80\x99s position would be required to complete a treatment program ordered by a traditional Family Court as a condition of regaining custody.'
p13346
aS'But the likelihood of losing one\xe2\x80\x99s child is high: there\xe2\x80\x99s little support for parents trying to finish treatment, and many drop out.'
p13347
aS'Federal data indicate that substance abuse accounts for nearly 40 percent of all cases in which a child is removed from home, though some experts believe that the number is as high as 80 percent.'
p13348
aS'Coleman\xe2\x80\x99s case was handled very differently.'
p13349
aS'Chautauqua County, N.Y., where she lives, had an innovative intervention program called Family Treatment Court, which gives parents access to a wide range of coordinated services.'
p13350
aS'Treatment programs are tailored to each participant\xe2\x80\x99s needs, and caseworkers and a presiding judge closely track their progress.'
p13351
aS'The first Family Treatment Court opened in Reno, Nevada in 1994, and there are now about 370 across the country.'
p13352
aS'The program helps parents complete drug and alcohol treatment, keeping them out of the criminal justice system and keeping their children out of foster care.'
p13353
aS'National statistics are not yet available to measure the effectiveness of the programs, because studies of Family Treatment Courts have generally been limited to assessments of individual programs, which vary in their methods.'
p13354
aS'One thing that is clear is that the innovation can save governments money.'
p13355
aS'A 2010 report on a Family Treatment Court in Oregon found that over a two-year period, the program reduced average criminal justice and child welfare costs by $13,000 a participant, whether or not they graduated.'
p13356
aS'But those courts serve only an estimated 5 to 10 percent of families who could benefit from them.'
p13357
aS'The need is growing across the country: opioid addiction is at epidemic levels and with it has come a flood of child welfare cases.'
p13358
aS'In Indiana, the number of children interacting with Child Protective Services jumped nearly 40 percent between 2013 and 2015; in 2016, the number of Massachusetts children placed in foster care reached 15,892, which Maria Mossaides, the state\xe2\x80\x99s child advocate, believes is a record high.'
p13359
aS'Before entering Family Treatment Court, Coleman struggled with addiction for years.'
p13360
aS'She had been prescribed opiates while recovering from an accident in which she had been severely burned and soon became addicted.'
p13361
aS'Sometimes she left her firstborn daughter alone with a physically abusive boyfriend so she could get high.'
p13362
aS'It was a pattern she had experienced herself, growing up in Dunkirk, in the western hills of New York State.'
p13363
aS'"All I\xe2\x80\x99d seen was domestic violence and chemical dependency from my mom and my whole family," she said.'
p13364
aS'"I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know any other way to live".'
p13365
aS'But when Coleman lost custody of her daughter in 2013, it was an alarm.'
p13366
aS'Ever since she was young, she\xe2\x80\x99d dreamed of being a mother.'
p13367
aS'Now, she realized that if she "didn\xe2\x80\x99t stop what I was doing I was going to destroy my daughter, and she was going to be doing the same thing I was in 10 years".'
p13368
aS'When Coleman began Family Treatment Court, she was nervous.'
p13369
aS'She didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to waste her chance to get help.'
p13370
aS'She decided to follow the program \xe2\x80\x94 "like a straight shooter" she said.'
p13371
aS'Coleman had tried to get clean in the past, but it never stuck.'
p13372
aS'So how did Family Treatment Court succeed where standard child welfare casework and substance abuse treatment failed?'
p13373
aS'For nine months, Coleman attended parenting courses, drug treatment and domestic violence counseling, guided by caseworkers and service providers.'
p13374
aS'She had weekly (and later, biweekly or monthly) court dates in which she and other participants met with Judge Judith Claire, who oversaw the program, to assess their progress.'
p13375
aS'She took quickly to the program\xe2\x80\x99s routine.'
p13376
aS'"It\xe2\x80\x99s your full-time job, which is the best part," she said.'
p13377
aS'"I learned how to get out the door in the morning and get everything accomplished".'
p13378
aS'Coleman was far from the first person in her family to appear in Family Court.'
p13379
aS'Her mother, aunts, uncles, grandparents and great-grandparents had all landed in court before Judge Claire, facing charges associated with child welfare, drugs and domestic violence.'
p13380
aS'(For years before starting the Family Treatment Court, Judge Claire presided over a traditional courtroom as the county\xe2\x80\x99s sole Family Court justice.'
p13381
aS') "Family Court is a revolving door," Judge Claire says now.'
p13382
aS'"Families come back again and again and again with the same problems".'
p13383
aS'Coleman doesn\xe2\x80\x99t remember her first time in court \xe2\x80\x94 she was a baby, and her mother was fighting to maintain custody of her.'
p13384
aS'But she remembers when her younger brother was abruptly removed from the house in the middle of the night and sent to live with an aunt.'
p13385
aS'Coleman was 14; her mother was addicted, working late hours at a nightclub, and Coleman\xe2\x80\x99s main memory of that night is relief at knowing that her brother would be safe.'
p13386
aS'Later, she recalls, her mother tried a boot-camp-style drug rehabilitation program, to no avail.'
p13387
aS'When Coleman was 17, her mother went missing for a year.'
p13388
aS'When Child Protective Services found out, they separated Coleman from her brother and sister.'
p13389
aS'Coleman was placed in foster care.'
p13390
aS'She ran away, eventually ending up in the care of another relative.'
p13391
aS'In time, she would see the inside of so many courtrooms that she no longer found herself nervous sitting before a judge.'
p13392
aS'"My mom was in court so many times with us," Coleman said.'
p13393
aS'"But she never got help. There were all these child protection cases and no real intervention".'
p13394
aS'Courts and child welfare agencies have been notoriously behind the times in their approaches to substance abuse.'
p13395
aS'"The thinking goes that if parents loved their children more, they\xe2\x80\x99d stop using," said Phil Breitenbucher, a program director at Children and Family Futures, an organization that focuses on families affected by substance abuse and trauma.'
p13396
aS'"Our policy and practices are still largely built on that outdated perspective".'
p13397
aS'Addiction today is increasingly seen as a disease, rather than a moral failing.'
p13398
aS'And although there are effective treatments, they rarely follow a linear or predictable course.'
p13399
aS'To make matters worse, there are many barriers for those seeking help.'
p13400
aS'Parents who are required to complete treatment programs to regain custody of their children must first contend with long waiting lists just to get in.'
p13401
aS'Substance abuse programs vary in quality.'
p13402
aS'Although, as The Times  , opioids are commonly covered by insurance plans, many addiction programs are not.'
p13403
aS'And chronically overburdened social workers, lawyers and judges are often unable to provide the level of support that is generally required for someone to persist long enough overcome an addiction.'
p13404
aS'By contrast, Family Treatment Court is collaborative and hands-on, particularly when the court follows what experts consider the best practices, as was the case in Chautauqua County when Samantha Coleman started her program.'
p13405
aS'The court adopted an approach called trauma-informed care, which seeks to avoid retraumatizing people through its oversight and directives.'
p13406
aS'Like Coleman, many parents in family court have experienced a long history of neglect, hurt and fear.'
p13407
aS'One distinctive aspect of Family Treatment Court is that participants are treated with respect and dignity, and they are supported so they can take charge of their recovery.'
p13408
aS'To counter the uncertainty and lack of control many participants experience in the child welfare system, Judge Claire provided detailed explanations about the operations of her courtroom and answered questions about the path ahead.'
p13409
aS'Rather than scolding participants when they slipped up, she reminded them of how far they\xe2\x80\x99d come.'
p13410
aS'She encouraged participants to devise solutions to their own problems, recognizing that their ideas might be more effective than the court\xe2\x80\x99s prescriptions.'
p13411
aS'"The whole court changed because of trauma-informed care," Judge Claire said.'
p13412
aS'"Everybody was working harder for the children\xe2\x80\x99s interests".'
p13413
aS'Coleman noticed the differences immediately.'
p13414
aS'Before Family Treatment Court, she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t recall any time her family was before a judge who seemed to understand what was going on in her home.'
p13415
aS'Their decisions felt hasty and arbitrary.'
p13416
aS'"Judge Claire dug in and asked questions," she said.'
p13417
aS'"She tried to get to the root of the issue".'
p13418
aS'Encouraged by the recognition that Judge Claire was intent on helping her take steps toward reuniting with her daughter, Coleman finally stopped using drugs.'
p13419
aS'"That was awesome, because it usually felt like nobody wanted you to be reunited with your child," she said.'
p13420
aS'By the time she completed the nine-month program, Coleman\xe2\x80\x99s daughter was back with her at home.'
p13421
aS'Coleman signed herself up for counseling and began working in a restaurant and as a caretaker for the elderly.'
p13422
aS'"Before, I could never have imagined I\xe2\x80\x99d do that," she said.'
p13423
aS'Family Treatment Court is still in its experimental stages.'
p13424
aS'Judges are not required to use a trauma-informed approach, and even when they do, their success \xe2\x80\x94 which depends on their ability to build relationships with participants, lawyers and caseworkers \xe2\x80\x94 can seem as much like an art as a science.'
p13425
aS'"Too often, the success of specialized courts turns tremendously on who the judge is, and whether they have the personality for it," said Jane Spinak, who directs the Adolescent Representation Clinic at Columbia Law School.'
p13426
aS'A system in which a change in leadership can have such an impact on outcomes "is not a sound system for building courts in the long run".'
p13427
aS'That critique, however, could be applied to much of the justice system, where case outcomes are regularly determined by assumptions and ambitions held by prosecutors and judges.'
p13428
aS'"There is a major need to standardize what a family treatment court is," Breitenbucher said, so that families\xe2\x80\x99 experiences become easier to predict.'
p13429
aS'The Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention, part of the Department of Justice, has tasked Breitenbucher\xe2\x80\x99s organization, Children and Family Futures, with drawing up a set of best practices for Family Treatment Court.'
p13430
aS'They will undoubtedly include the use of trauma-informed care, which Coleman credits for her success.'
p13431
aS'The only negative thing about the Family Treatment Court, she said, was that she had to lose her daughter to qualify.'
p13432
aS'"Without Treatment Court, I would never know these resources existed," she added.'

aS'Fonda responded: "Well, thanks. \xc2\xa0But let me tell you why I love this movie that we did, Our Souls at Night, (pause) rather than plastic surgery".'

aS'\xc2\xa0Yet, until Republicans outline which loopholes are ending, the blueprint released this week promises substantial benefit\xc2\xa0for wealthier taxpayers.'

aS"Supporters of its elimination say it can force family-owned businesses to be broken up and sold to pay taxes, affecting workers' jobs."
p13905
aS'Yet\xc2\xa0according to the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center,\xc2\xa0only roughly 50\xc2\xa0small business and small farm estates nationwide will face any estate tax in 2017, owing on average less than 6% of their value in tax.'

aS'The provision also brings in significant revenue to the federal Treasury.'
p13907
aS"\xc2\xa0It's a similar story with the Alternative Minimum Tax."
p13908
aS'A small minority, 3% of all taxpayers, had to pay the AMT, according to IRS data of the 2014 tax year reviewed by Forbes magazine.'
p13909
aS'Doing away with it would be costly, as it brought in over $28 billion in revenue the same year.'
p13910

p14508
aS'Our fiscal history on this point is clear: Cutting taxes loses revenues, which, unless offset by higher taxes elsewhere or spending cuts, increases the budget deficit, which in turn raises the debt.'

aS') In fact, the Republican budget hawk is a rare bird.'
p14511
aS'There are, instead, flocks of chicken hawks who use the deficit argument to block spending, promote fiscal austerity, and small government, conveniently tossing deficit concerns aside when it comes to tax cuts.'
p14512
aS'But deficits don\xe2\x80\x99t seem to hurt the economy.'
p14513
aS'So, what\xe2\x80\x99s the problem?'
p14514
aS'Economists\xe2\x80\x99 main argument against budget deficits has long been that when the government borrows, it crowds out private-sector borrowing, thus misallocating resources and increasing interest rates.'
p14515
aS'Though this dynamic is certainly possible in full-employment economies, we\xe2\x80\x99ve recently sustained both budget deficits   low interest rates for many years running, which is why debt service costs as a share of the economy remain historically  .'
p14516
aS'The pattern isn\xe2\x80\x99t surprising when you consider how much the Federal Reserve has been in the mix, holding its benchmark interest rate near zero for most of the last 10 years (it now stands at 1.25 percent).'
p14517
aS'In addition, global financial flows have accelerated in recent years, and the United States has been a prime destination for that money.'
p14518
aS'That\xe2\x80\x99s increased the supply of loanable funds and pushed down rates regardless of the magnitude of the federal budget deficit.'
p14519
aS'Meanwhile, we\xe2\x80\x99ve been experiencing "secular stagnation" \xe2\x80\x94 persistently weak demand, even in recoveries like the one we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen over the last several years \xe2\x80\x94 which is associated with higher savings, less investment (think of firms sitting on their earnings or buying back shares versus reinvesting) and lower interest rates.'
p14520
aS'Do these forces mean deficits don\xe2\x80\x99t matter?'
p14521
aS'Not at all.'
p14522
aS'The problem with structural deficits \xe2\x80\x94 ones that go up even in good times \xe2\x80\x94 is that they reveal that we\xe2\x80\x99re unwilling to raise the necessary revenues to support the government we want and need.'
p14523
aS'This enables those who whose goal is to shrink government to point to deficits and debt as their proof that we can\xe2\x80\x99t afford it, whatever "it" is, except when "it" is tax cuts.'
p14524
aS'Such faux hawks don\xe2\x80\x99t hate budget deficits at all.'
p14525
aS'To the contrary, they quite like them, because they provide scary-sounding numbers they can point to as the reason government can\xe2\x80\x99t afford to shore up Social Security and Medicare.'

aS'This is a big part of their whole tax cut play.'

aS'When the offsetting growth effects fail to appear, the tax cutters are not going to apologize for their shortsightedness and agree to raise taxes back to at least where they were.'
p14531
aS'They\xe2\x80\x99ll argue that in the face of these unforeseen deficits, our only course of action is to cut spending.'
p14532
aS'Mr. Trump\xe2\x80\x99s benighted tax cuts are thus a double whammy to economically vulnerable families.'
p14533
aS'They get little from the cuts themselves, because they\xe2\x80\x99re so regressive.'
p14534
aS'Then, these households get dinged again by subsequent spending cuts to programs on which they depend.'
p14535
aS'According to one  , low-income families get a tiny boost \xe2\x80\x94 less than 1 percent \xe2\x80\x94 from Mr. Trump\xe2\x80\x99s plan, but once you factor in spending cuts, their income falls by about 10 percent.'
p14536
aS'We don\xe2\x80\x99t need a tax cut that will lead to higher deficits that will then be used as a rationale for ever more spending cuts.'

p14556
aS'Banning pledging, the dangerous monthslong initiation period, also helps.'
p14557
aS'For about a decade, Sigma Alpha Epsilon had more hazing and alcohol-related deaths than any other fraternity; it banned pledging altogether in 2014, and since then insurance claims have dropped from an average of 13 a year to two, and no one has died from hazing or drinking.'
p14558
aS'Enforcement has been key: More than 30 chapters have been closed for alcohol violations.'

p14585
aS'We now face the prospect of a resurgence of the disease.'
p14586
aS'Strains that are resistant to multiple drugs have appeared in Southeast Asia, and could spread to Africa, where they have the potential to cause a deadly catastrophe.'
p14587
aS'This has happened at least three times before, and conditions are ripe for it to happen again.'
p14588
aS'As someone who has had malaria four times, I know the awful power of this disease.'
p14589
aS'I remember how grim the situation was in Africa in the 1990s when two of the most used medicines then, chloroquine and sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine, were failing.'
p14590
aS'A sense of hopelessness was felt by the people living with malaria and those of us working to stop the disease.'
p14591
aS'We had to accept a daily disaster \xe2\x80\x94 as a colleague of mine has put it, a 747 full of African children crashing into a mountain every three hours, day and night, for years on end.'

aS'With an enormous amount of work, we managed to reduce this carnage to something less horrible.'
p14593
aS'But I don\xe2\x80\x99t ever want to go back to those days.'
p14594
aS'Malaria is transmitted to humans (and other animals) by infected mosquitoes, who inject malaria parasites into the bloodstream.'
p14595
aS'The parasites spread throughout the body and multiply exponentially, causing chills, fever, headache, nausea and intense fatigue.'
p14596
aS'Over the last century, researchers have developed effective medicines for malaria, including quinine, chloroquine, sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine, mefloquine, and artemisinin.'
p14597
aS'When taken promptly, those drugs killed the parasites before they killed their host.'
p14598
aS'Unfortunately, as usually happens in the battle between microbe and human, the malaria bug has evolved and developed resistance to our medicines.'
p14599
aS'As a result, malaria has been beaten back in several places over the last 75 years, only to spread again, more lethal than before because the drugs no longer work.'
p14600
aS'Frequently, drug-resistant strains have originated in the Mekong region of Asia, an area that includes Myanmar, Thailand, Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam and the Yunnan Province of China.'
p14601
aS'We are not sure why it starts there; it is likely a combination of factors.'
p14602
aS'The parasites that circulate in the region may be able to mutate especially quickly.'
p14603
aS'The region draws tens of thousands of migrants, who come for work on rubber plantations and in other industries, and who are particularly susceptible to malaria since they have lower levels of natural immunity.'
p14604
aS'Because of widespread poverty, as well as lack of health care and education, those who get sick often use less medicine than they should, or use counterfeit drugs; both practices spur drug resistance.'
p14605
aS'Once drug resistance appears in the Mekong region, it spreads, often with ghastly results.'
p14606
aS'In the 1950s, chloroquine-resistant malaria jumped to India and Africa, killing millions.'
p14607
aS'Researchers, drug companies and public health officials came up with a replacement by combining two existing drugs, but then in the 1970s, parasites resistant to the sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine combination appeared in the Mekong and spread globally, rendering the treatment useless.'
p14608
aS'Since the late 1990s, we have relied on a drug called artemisinin, which is the best treatment we have ever had for malaria.'
p14609
aS'Much of our recent success against this disease reflects the power of this medicine.'
p14610
aS'It kills the parasite quickly, with few side effects, and it has saved millions of lives.'
p14611
aS'We have tried to forestall resistance by combining artemisinin with other drugs, much as we do when treating H.I.V. and tuberculosis, but the day of reckoning appears to be at hand.'
p14612
aS'Over the past decade, several studies have found widespread resistance to the artemisinin-piperaquine combination throughout Southeast Asia.'
p14613
aS'At some spots in western Cambodia, more than 40 percent of people who received artemisinin drug combinations failed to clear the parasites from their blood, or got sick again soon after treatment ended.'
p14614
aS'This is a clear and ominous sign that the parasites are becoming more resistant.'
p14615
aS'So now we stand once again on the edge of the precipice.'
p14616
aS'This time the risk of untreatable malaria is even greater than in the past, because no new drugs are likely to be available in the next few years.'
p14617
aS'It takes a long time for drugs to go through the development pipeline, and most of the leading candidates are close relatives of artemisinin, so the malaria-causing parasites will likely be resistant to those drugs as well.'
p14618
aS'The first response of the public health community was to try to contain drug-resistant malaria in the Mekong region where it originated, preventing its wider spread.'
p14619
aS'But past experience shows that this is not easy to do, and we now have clear evidence that multidrug resistant strains have spread across hundreds of miles, crossing national borders.'
p14620
aS'Even worse, new resistant strains are popping up repeatedly and spreading, in a lethal version of Whac-a-Mole.'
p14621
aS'Instead, we should focus on a more ambitious strategy: to eliminate malaria from the Mekong region.'
p14622
aS'This will be difficult, because the areas with the highest rates of malaria tend to be poor, rural and underdeveloped.'
p14623
aS'But with coordination, hard work and proper funding, we can achieve our goal.'
p14624
aS'Malaria has been eliminated from many regions where it was once common: the Southern United States, Russia, southern Europe, the Middle East and, most recently, Sri Lanka.'
p14625
aS'There is no reason we can\xe2\x80\x99t do the same in the Mekong region.'
p14626
aS'A broad consensus has emerged that elimination is the best strategy.'
p14627
aS'The World Health Organization; the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria; the President\xe2\x80\x99s Malaria Initiative; the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and others, have all expressed their commitment to this approach, as have the countries in the region.'
p14628
aS'Elimination will require a coordinated attack using all the weapons at our disposal.'
p14629
aS'We know we can eventually eliminate malaria from the region by using the currently available anti-mosquito and anti-parasite measures, including insecticides and bed nets, plus medicines and diagnostic tests.'
p14630
aS'Eliminating multidrug resistant malaria from the Mekong before it spreads to Africa will require so-called elimination accelerators, including highly sensitive new tests to identify symptom-free carriers of malaria infection, and mass drug treatment of infected groups or populations.'
p14631
aS'We also need closer cooperation from American and European health officials, international health agencies and financers, local nongovernmental organizations and especially from the inhabitants and governments of the Mekong region.'
p14632
aS'We must ramp up quickly; drug resistance is spreading; if it spins out of control, we run the risk of a huge resurgence of malaria in other parts of Asia and especially in Africa.'
p14633
aS'The memory haunts Bill Carpenter even 50 years after his tour in Vietnam ended.'
p14634
aS'An elderly villager dressed in white had just carted geese over the dark Song Ve River when he crossed paths with Mr. Carpenter\xe2\x80\x99s platoon \xe2\x80\x94 a unit known as Tiger Force.'

aS'The gunshots that struck the man down still shake Mr. Carpenter from his sleep.'
p14639
aS'"There was no reason to kill that old man," Mr. Carpenter, a former Army specialist, said in a recent interview.'
p14640
aS'The killing was one of dozens of attacks by Tiger Force during 1967 on unarmed civilians, including rapes and torture, in a spate of violence that was covered up by the Pentagon but revealed in   by The Toledo Blade in 2003.'
p14641
aS'Records showed the unit, an element of the 101st Airborne Division, carried out what\xe2\x80\x99s believed to be the longest series of atrocities by a platoon in the war.'
p14642
aS'They hurled grenades into bunkers where women and children were hiding, shot prisoners and then cut off their ears and scalps for souvenirs, murdered villagers for no reason and left many of them behind in mass graves.'
p14643
aS'Military experts who examined the Tiger Force case said the troops were acting out of rage over the death of comrades, frustration over fighting a canny enemy and fear for their own safety.'
p14644
aS'But some of the soldiers themselves spoke years later of orders that made them treat civilians like adversaries, let them fire weapons with little clear justification and measured success from body counts \xe2\x80\x94 the supposed enumeration of enemy dead that was likely to include anyone killed by American troops.'
p14645
aS'As with the My Lai Massacre in 1968, in which American troops killed hundreds of women, children and old men in hamlets near the Tiger Force operations area, commanders had an arm\xe2\x80\x99s length role in either encouraging or covering up what happened.'
p14646
aS'Records show that members of Tiger Force shot or stabbed at least 81 civilians in violation of military law.'
p14647

aS'The platoon\xe2\x80\x99s 45 members were expected to survive for weeks at a time in the bush as they searched for enemy camps and called in air strikes.'
p14657
aS'But in May 1967, as American commanders grew frustrated by a war in which their foes could blend into the civilian populace, Tiger Force was sent to Quang Ngai province to move civilians into relocation centers so the farmers couldn\xe2\x80\x99t grow rice, depriving the enemy of a crucial food supply.'
p14658
aS'Rather than soldiers fighting soldiers, they were destroying peoples\xe2\x80\x99 lives, uprooting them from their homes.'
p14659

p14686
aS'The platoon\xe2\x80\x99s commanders told the soldiers, and reporters for The Blade years later, that the shootings were permissible because they were in a "free-fire zone," where American troops in Vietnam could fire at will without approval of commanders, an approach that led to civilian casualties throughout Vietnam.'

aS'Still, black players kneeling in this way has a disorienting quality.'
p16112
aS'Clearly, however humble and sincere Kaepernick\xe2\x80\x99s intentions, his critics have decided that he is disrespecting a growing list of American institutions: the flag, fallen service members \xe2\x80\x94 even the perceived line between playing professional sports and speaking out on issues of national importance.'
p16113
aS'Perhaps that is why so many players, eager to sympathize but wary of joining Kaepernick completely, have instead stood and locked arms.'
p16114
aS'Yet by doing so, they have, deliberately or not, diluted the original gesture of kneeling.'
p16115
aS'Standing with linked arms during the national anthem could signify any number of things, from protest against racial injustice, to a gentle dissent from a style of protest that has alienated so many people.'
p16116
aS'Likewise, the decision of some teams to stay in the locker room during the playing of the national anthem is ambiguous.'
p16117
aS'Even players raising their fists lacks the relevance, and the unsettling resonance, of the Black Power salute from which the gesture is derived.'
p16118
aS'The unique gesture that embodied a cry against, primarily, the murder by the police of unarmed black citizens \xe2\x80\x94 and, as an extension of those actions, a criminal-justice system that countenances those murders \xe2\x80\x94 has now been customized, if you will.'
p16119
aS'The primal act that has incited so much passion has been marginalized as a gesture of protest.'
p16120
aS'President Trump seemed to understand the significance of variation as concession when he announced Sunday afternoon that standing with linked arms was acceptable, while kneeling was not.'
p16121
aS'There was something disquieting about Shahid Khan, the owner of the Jacksonville Jaguars and a Trump supporter who contributed $1 million to the president\xe2\x80\x99s inaugural committee, joining arms with his players, who were standing, not kneeling.'
p16122
aS'Trump\xe2\x80\x99s dispensation for standing with linked arms must have come as a relief to the white team owners who, despite their loud defenses of the players\xe2\x80\x99 right to air their views, still have yet to make a job offer to Kaepernick, a very talented quarterback, effectively blackballing him.'
p16123
aS'Three-quarters of the players in America\xe2\x80\x99s most popular and most brutal sport are black.'
p16124
aS'There is something gladiatorial about professional football, for all the money being made by athletes whose wealth will be of little use to them should they sink into dementia, beginning as early as their retirement in their mid-30s.'
p16125
aS'Here are these black athletes about to be hurt for the enjoyment of so many white fans, even as the white world tolerates the "lawful" injury of ordinary black people.'
p16126
aS'Such a situation could well incite a fury of anger and frustration.'
p16127
aS'Yet with the act of kneeling, these rare, gifted, often doomed human beings are shrouding their protest in a kind of self-abasement; a display of vulnerability and piety in the face of iron injustice.'
p16128
aS'It is a humility couched in a majesty of pride, dignity, strength and unusual accomplishment.'
p16129
aS'Sixty years ago today, Minnijean Brown and eight other black students walked into all-white Central High School in Little Rock, Ark., as angry white protesters shouted obscenities, spat on them and threatened violence in full view of television cameras.'
p16130
aS'The Little Rock Nine were escorted by soldiers from the 101st Airborne Division at the order of President Eisenhower, a moment that is rightly celebrated as a triumph in civil rights history.'
p16131
aS'But a few months after taking her historic steps, Minnijean was suspended for dropping a cafeteria tray after white students obstructed her path.'
p16132
aS'She was later expelled for calling other tormentors "white trash," after they threw a purse full of combination locks at her.'
p16133
aS'Although these were not major transgressions, and she was not the instigator, Minnijean was the one harshly disciplined, not the white students.'
p16134
aS'Back then, inequitably harsh discipline was a tool used by resistant white schools to make sure that racial integration would not mean equal education for black students.'
p16135
aS'The racial discipline gap is now a firmly established reality in Arkansas and around the country.'
p16136
aS'Today, racial disparities in school discipline send the message that blacks are still unequal and unwanted in Arkansas schools.'
p16137
aS'The state ranks 13th in the out-of-school suspension gap between black and white students, according to a recent  .'
p16138
aS'During the 2012 school year, black students were suspended five times as often as whites were, and little has changed since then.'
p16139
aS'The racial discipline gap is not restricted to Arkansas, or to the South.'
p16140
aS'The same report finds that several Northern states, including Illinois, Michigan and Wisconsin, rank above Arkansas in the black-white suspension gap.'
p16141
aS'And a recent   on California schools from the Brookings Institution finds evidence of this gap despite a statewide initiative to reduce suspensions.'
p16142
aS'According to a Department of Education  , black students nationally were three times more likely to be suspended than whites in 2012.'
p16143
aS'Suspensions occur most commonly in secondary schools, but black children were more than twice as likely to be suspended from preschool as well.'
p16144
aS'Harsher discipline for black students is not just a   or state-level problem.'
p16145
aS'It is a   crisis.'
p16146
aS'Other   indicates that black students are punitively disciplined for relatively minor infractions, such as showing disrespect to teachers, willful disobedience or talking too loudly, while white students who commit more serious infractions are punished less severely.'
p16147
aS'White middle-class parents, exercising white privilege, often intervene on behalf of their children, making school authorities reluctant to discipline them harshly.'
p16148
aS'These students are usually viewed by staff as "good kids," while black kids are typically labeled troublemakers.'
p16149
aS'Unfortunately, these perceptions of racial differences in conduct and character have long histories in America.'
p16150
aS'In 1891, the Southern educational leader J. L. M. Curry proclaimed that blacks displayed "lack of self restraint" and didn\xe2\x80\x99t obey "moral law".'
p16151
aS'Today many educators appear to harbor such views, causing black students to view school as a hostile environment, leading to higher dropout rates, lower levels of achievement and disengagement from school activities.'
p16152
aS'Some educators and other observers blame black kids for the racial discipline gap, suggesting that they misbehave more often.'
p16153
aS'But this may be more myth than fact, as some studies suggest that race is a more powerful predictor of discipline than differential behavior, especially when considering the unequal penalties assessed to black and white kids for comparable infractions.'
p16154
aS'In 1957, racial inequality and the racial achievement gap were forcefully maintained by white politicians, parents and police officers determined to keep the Little Rock Nine and other blacks from attending white schools.'
p16155
aS'School integration broke racial barriers at the schoolhouse doors, and the racial achievement gap closed considerably in the 1970s and \xe2\x80\x9980s.'
p16156
aS'Today about a third of black students attend majority white secondary schools, yet the color line endures within these schools because of unfair suspension and expulsion practices.'
p16157
aS'around the country are experimenting with ways of mitigating these punitive discipline practices that land more harshly on black students, assaulting their dignity, depressing their achievement and pushing some out of school and on to a pipeline to prison.'
p16158
aS'The shift to   approaches is a promising step.'
p16159
aS'This method brings together the victim and the offender, as well as teachers and parents, to address what happened and come up with solutions.'
p16160
aS'But what about schools slow to follow this example?'
p16161
aS'We need to get more hard data on the racial discipline gap from   school districts.'
p16162
aS'We need more anti-racist training for administrators and teachers.'
p16163
aS'We need a standardized accountability index to monitor school disciplinary practices to ensure that black students are no more likely than other students to be subjected to suspension.'
p16164
aS'And we need to tie school performance evaluations to making measurable progress in achieving these goals.'
p16165
aS'Minnijean\xe2\x80\x99s experience, and the experiences of countless black students who bear the brunt of punitive discipline in K-12 schools today, demonstrates that we still have work to do to address this injustice.'
p16166
aS'In early 2016, I began paying attention to reports about the incredible number of unarmed black people being killed by the police.'
p16167
aS'The posts on social media deeply disturbed me, but one in particular brought me to tears: the killing of Alton Sterling in my hometown Baton Rouge, La.'
p16168
aS'This could have happened to any of my family members who still live in the area.'
p16169
aS'I felt furious, hurt and hopeless.'
p16170
aS'I wanted to do something, but didn\xe2\x80\x99t know what or how to do it.'
p16171
aS'All I knew for sure is that I wanted it to be as respectful as possible.'
p16172
aS'A few weeks later, during preseason, my teammate Colin Kaepernick chose to sit on the bench during the national anthem to protest police brutality.'
p16173
aS'To be honest, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t notice at the time, and neither did the news media.'
p16174
aS'It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t until after our third preseason game on Aug. 26, 2016, that his protest gained national attention, and the backlash against him began.'
p16175
aS'That\xe2\x80\x99s when my faith moved me to take action.'
p16176
aS'I looked to James 2:17, which states, "Faith by itself, if it does not have works, is dead".'
p16177
aS'I knew I needed to stand up for what is right.'
p16178
aS'I approached Colin the Saturday before our next game to discuss how I could get involved with the cause but also how we could make a more powerful and positive impact on the social justice movement.'
p16179
aS'We spoke at length about many of the issues that face our community, including systemic oppression against people of color, police brutality and the criminal justice system.'
p16180
aS'We also discussed how we could use our platform, provided to us by being professional athletes in the N.F.L., to speak for those who are voiceless.'
p16181
aS'After hours of careful consideration, and even a visit from Nate Boyer, a retired Green Beret and former N.F.L. player, we came to the conclusion that  , rather than sit, the next day during the anthem as a peaceful protest.'
p16182
aS'We chose to kneel because it\xe2\x80\x99s a respectful gesture.'
p16183
aS'I remember thinking our posture was like a flag flown at half-mast to mark a tragedy.'
p16184
aS'It baffles me that our protest is still being misconstrued as disrespectful to the country, flag and military personnel.'
p16185
aS'We chose it because it\xe2\x80\x99s exactly the opposite.'
p16186
aS'It has always been my understanding that the brave men and women who fought and died for our country did so to ensure that we could live in a fair and free society, which includes the right to speak out in protest.'
p16187
aS'It should go without saying that I love my country and I\xe2\x80\x99m proud to be an American.'
p16188
aS'But, to quote James Baldwin, "exactly for this reason, I insist on the right to criticize her perpetually".'
p16189
aS'I can\xe2\x80\x99t find words that appropriately express how heartbroken I am to see the constant smears against Colin, a person who helped start the movement with only the very best of intentions.'
p16190
aS'We are talking about a man who helped to orchestrate a commercial planeful of food and supplies for famine-stricken Somalia.'
p16191
aS'A man who has invested his time and money into needy communities here at home.'
p16192
aS'A man I am proud to call my brother, who should be celebrated for his courage to seek change on important issues.'
p16193
aS'Instead, to this day, he is unemployed and portrayed as a radical un-American who wants to divide our country.'
p16194
aS'Anybody who has a basic knowledge of football knows that his unemployment has nothing to do with his performance on the field.'
p16195
aS'It\xe2\x80\x99s a shame that the league has turned its back on a man who has done only good.'
p16196
aS'I am aware that my involvement in this movement means that my career may face the same outcome as Colin\xe2\x80\x99s.'
p16197
aS'But to quote the Rev.'

aS'Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., "A time comes when silence is betrayal".'
p16199
aS'And I choose not to betray those who are being oppressed.'
p16200
aS'I have too often seen our efforts belittled with statements like "He should have listened to the officer," after watching an unarmed black person get shot, or "There is no such thing as white privilege" and "Racism ended years ago".'
p16201
aS'We know that racism and white privilege are both very much alive today.'
p16202
aS'And it\xe2\x80\x99s disheartening and infuriating that President Trump has referred to us with slurs but the neo-Nazis in Charlottesville, Va., as "very fine people".'
p16203
aS'His remarks are a clear attempt to deepen the rift that we\xe2\x80\x99ve tried so hard to mend.'
p16204
aS'I am nevertheless encouraged to see my colleagues and other public figures respond to the president\xe2\x80\x99s remarks with solidarity with us.'
p16205
aS'It is paramount that we take control of the story behind our movement, which is that we seek equality for all Americans, no matter their race or gender.'

aS'What we need now is numbers.'
p16207
aS'Some people acknowledge the issues we face yet remain silent bystanders.'
p16208
aS'Not only do we need more of our fellow black and brown Americans to stand with us, but also people of other races.'
p16209
aS'I refuse to be one of those people who watches injustices yet does nothing.'
p16210
aS'I want to be a man my children and children\xe2\x80\x99s children can be proud of, someone who faced adversity and tried to make a positive impact on the world, a person who, 50 years from now, is remembered for standing for what was right, even though it was not the popular or easy choice.'

p16224
aS'Mindful of details like these, the citizens clap and shout slogans and root for the soldiers from their country.'

aS'It begins to feel as if a small war is about to break out between the soldiers.'
p16226
aS'A strange sight follows: After the flag-lowering ritual is over, Indians and Pakistanis rush toward the border gates.'
p16227
aS'They stare at one another curiously.'
p16228

p16265
aS'The task often consists in selling products or creating new advertising strategies.'

aS'The average episode goes something like this: The contestants \xe2\x80\x94 a majority of them white and privileged \xe2\x80\x94 receive about $5,000 to build a small kiosk in a mall.'
p16267
aS'They spend a couple of arduous days on the telephone, persuading other businesspeople to do favors such as donating products or attending marketing events.'

aS'(I imagine a real-life waiter who works for minimum-wage salary watching this and collapsing in sobs into a fetal position.'

p16275
aS'(Let\xe2\x80\x99s call it the power of networking.'
p16276

p16282
aS'Look at the case of Cyrela, one of the biggest real estate companies in Brazil.'
p16283
aS'Cyrela agreed to renovate the restrooms in a S\xc3\xa3o Paulo park at "no cost" to the public, even though the renovation should cost about $140,000.'

aS'His first duty was to preside over the inauguration ceremony of the new toilets donated by his own former company.'

p16290
aS'Mr. Doria doesn\xe2\x80\x99t see any conflicts of interest \xe2\x80\x94 though he once threatened to end an interview as soon as the issue came up.'
p16291
aS'On that occasion, the journalist was questioning the mayor on his links to one of his many private-sector pals: the owner of a drugstore chain called Ultrafarma, who happens to be a member of Lide, an events company founded by Mr. Doria and now run by his son.'
p16292
aS'The group often promotes business events with the participation of politicians.'
p16293

aS'(The mayor\xe2\x80\x99s press office denies this.'
p16295
aS') A day later, the mayor posted a video in which he personally advertised Ultrafarma\xe2\x80\x99s vitamin brand before a meeting of his cabinet.'
p16296
aS'The following month, Ultrafarma made an official donation to the municipality, this time in the form of prime-time TV advertisements for Mr. Doria\xe2\x80\x99s controversial cleanup program "Cidade Linda" (Beautiful City), which has been criticized by many citizens as a boondoggle.'
p16297
aS'It\xe2\x80\x99s unclear how the city itself should have benefited from this donation.'
p16298
aS'What\xe2\x80\x99s even more worrying is that this "Aprendiz"-like behavior may not be confined to S\xc3\xa3o Paulo.'
p16299
aS'Mr. Doria is considered a possible candidate for the 2018 presidential elections.'
p16300
aS'From a business perspective, a timely donation to the city may pay off more than making a contribution to a political campaign.'
p16301
aS'In fact, this ethical minefield in Mr. Doria\xe2\x80\x99s administration has emerged soon after the Supreme Court decided to ban corporate donations to political campaigns.'
p16302
aS'The goal was precisely to weaken the ties between the government and business interests that could lead to bribery and other forms of corruption.'
p16303
aS'But Mr. Doria remains unperturbed in his polo shirt while managing ethically questionable decisions.'
p16304
aS'The mayor had already restricted the autonomy of the Office of the Municipal Comptroller General, the city\xe2\x80\x99s recently created anticorruption agency, and last month he fired the acting comptroller general "for administrative and operational reasons".'

aS'As a protest, three officials at the agency resigned, including the head of the integrity department.'
p16306
aS'Curiously, in the fifth episode of Season 8 of "O Aprendiz," Mr. Doria fired a contestant for using his connections with a business executive to get ahead in one of the challenges.'

p16311
aS'And not by a hair, either \xe2\x80\x94 the Alternative for Germany, or AfD, won 12.6 percent, ahead of stalwart parties like the Greens and the pro-business Free Democrats, making it the third-largest caucus among the seven represented in the Parliament.'

aS'I will try to explain why both can be true at the same time.'
p16319
aS'It\xe2\x80\x99s a sad day because some 5.8 million Germans cast their vote for the AfD.'
p16320
aS'Founded in 2013 by a m\xc3\xa9lange of ultra-conservatives, right-wing economists and assorted fringe groups who were concerned about Chancellor Angela Merkel\xe2\x80\x99s adamant commitment to the euro, the party adopted an anti-immigrant stance, galvanized by the 2015-16 refugee crisis.'
p16321
aS'In both its platform and the public statements by AfD representatives, the party increasingly used racist language.'
p16322
aS'The AfD regards the German people as a coherent biological body under threat to be "destroyed" by immigration.'
p16323
aS'It strives to protect Germany\xe2\x80\x99s "endemic" culture against immigrant cultures, which it regards as inferior.'
p16324
aS'Alexander Gauland, one of the party\xe2\x80\x99s two front-runners, recently demanded that Aydan Ozogus, a policy maker of Turkish descent, be "disposed of" in Turkey.'
p16325
aS'He also said that Germany could be proud of "the achievements of German soldiers in two world wars".'
p16326
aS'In a statement after the election results, Mr. Gauland said "We will take back our country and our people".'
p16327
aS'The AfD will receive about 94 out of approximately 709 seats in the new parliament, meaning many even more obscure figures than Mr. Gauland will sweep into the Bundestag, people sympathizing with extremist groups and conspiracy theorists.'
p16328
aS'But there\xe2\x80\x99s another way to look at these results.'
p16329
aS'Only two years after 890,000 immigrants entered Germany almost at the same time, nearly overloading the system; only one year and nine months after gangs of young men, many of whom were immigrants from northern Africa, sexually harassed hundreds of women on New Year\xe2\x80\x99s Eve in Cologne; only months after a series of terrorist attacks in Germany, one in the very capital of the country, left 12 dead \xe2\x80\x94 after all this, 87 percent of German voters still cast their ballot for parties   than the anti-immigration, far-right AfD.'
p16330
aS'No matter what the AfD tried to argue during the closing weeks of the race, the past year and a half tells a story of national unity rather than of national agony.'
p16331
aS'Given the relatively staid nature of German politics, it may be hard for outsiders to grasp just how contentious the past two years have been.'
p16332
aS'In January 2016, just after the Cologne attacks, the atmosphere in Germany was close to ignition.'
p16333
aS'Trust in the government sharply dropped, and so did Mrs. Merkel\xe2\x80\x99s poll numbers.'
p16334
aS'Some polls put the AfD as high as 15 percent.'
p16335
aS'But then the governing coalition of center-left Social Democrats and center-right Christian Democrats changed its policy.'
p16336
aS'The Bundestag passed a series of laws restricting immigration, and it gave enhanced powers to police and intelligence services.'
p16337
aS'Mrs. Merkel, a Christian Democrat, pushed an agreement with Turkey to hold back refugees in exchange for financial support.'
p16338
aS'Not all these policies are smart.'
p16339
aS'Some will hinder the integration of refugees and other immigrants who are in Germany to stay.'
p16340
aS'But many are reasonable and necessary, and none undermine the coalition government\xe2\x80\x99s basic commitment to help refugees.'
p16341
aS'And they shored up public support for Mrs. Merkel, for the government and for the country\xe2\x80\x99s refugee policy.'
p16342
aS'If you look at democracy as a marketplace of ideas and positions, Germany\xe2\x80\x99s political economy has actually worked extremely well over the past year.'
p16343
aS'The AfD surged because of a market gap for stricter immigration laws \xe2\x80\x94 and when the established parties adopted policies to fill this gap, the extremists were robbed of their fuel.'
p16344
aS'Today, according to one poll, only 50 percent of Germans consider refugees an "important problem".'
p16345
aS'In this week\xe2\x80\x99s election, people cared deeply about education, about elderly care, about North Korea.'
p16346
aS'Refugee policy was one important topic, but not the dominant one.'
p16347
aS'Sixty percent said they voted for the AfD because they were dissatisfied with the established parties.'
p16348
aS'But even that response is a good sign; it shows that we do not necessarily have five million racists living among us.'
p16349
aS'This was a belated act of protest, not a shift in the country\xe2\x80\x99s ideological landscape.'
p16350
aS'Many Germans have nagged their way through this campaign \xe2\x80\x94 too dull, they said, too boring, not confrontational enough.'
p16351
aS'I found that annoying: What sort of election did they want?'
p16352
aS'The kind that features a candidate who calls his opponent "crooked"?'
p16353
aS'On Sunday, Germans had the option of two capable and experienced major candidates, and many more in a variety of smaller parties, representing pretty much every political viewpoint.'

aS'BEIJING \xe2\x80\x94 My grandmother likes to tell stories from her career as a journalist in the early decades of the People\xe2\x80\x99s Republic of China.'
p16360
aS'She recalls scrawling down Chairman Mao\xe2\x80\x99s latest pronouncements as they came through loudspeakers and talking with joyous peasants from the newly collectivized countryside.'
p16361
aS'In what was her career highlight, she turned an anonymous candy salesman into a national labor hero with glowing praises for his service to the people.'
p16362
aS'She had grown up in the central province of Hunan, where her father was a landlord.'

aS'"The Communists did many terrible things," my grandmother always says at the end of her reminiscences.'
p16365
aS'"But they made women\xe2\x80\x99s lives much better".'
p16366
aS'That often-repeated dictum sums up the popular perception of Mao Zedong\xe2\x80\x99s legacy regarding women in China.'
p16367
aS'As every Chinese schoolchild learns in history class, the Communists rescued peasant daughters from urban brothels and ushered cloistered wives into factories, liberating them from the oppression of Confucian patriarchy and imperialist threat.'
p16368
aS'But the narrative of an across-the-board elevation of women\xe2\x80\x99s status under Mao contains crucial caveats.'
p16369
aS'While the Communist revolution brought women more job opportunities, it also made their interests subordinate to collective goals.'
p16370
aS'Stopping at the household doorstep, Mao\xe2\x80\x99s words and policies did little to alleviate women\xe2\x80\x99s domestic burdens like housework and child care.'
p16371
aS'And by inundating society with rhetoric blithely celebrating its achievements, the revolution deprived women of the private language with which they might understand and articulate their personal experiences.'
p16372
aS'When historians researched the collectivization of the Chinese countryside in the 1950s, an event believed to have empowered rural women by offering them employment, they discovered a complicated picture.'
p16373
aS'While women indeed contributed enormously to collective farming, they rarely rose to positions of responsibility; they remained outsiders in communes organized around their husbands\xe2\x80\x99 family and village relationships.'
p16374
aS'Studies also showed that women routinely performed physically demanding jobs but earned less than men, since the lighter, most valued tasks involving large animals or machinery were usually reserved for men.'
p16375
aS'The urban workplace was hardly more inspiring.'
p16376
aS'Women were shunted to collective neighborhood workshops with meager pay and dismal working conditions, while men were more commonly employed in comfortable big-industry and state-enterprise jobs.'
p16377
aS'Party cadres\xe2\x80\x99 explanations for this reflected deeply entrenched gender prejudices: Women have a weaker constitution and gentler temper, rendering them unfit for the strenuous tasks of operating heavy equipment or manning factory floors.'
p16378
aS'The party at times paid lip service to the equal sharing of domestic labor, but in practice it condoned women\xe2\x80\x99s continuing subordination in the home.'
p16379
aS'In posters and speeches, female socialist icons were portrayed as "iron women" who labored heroically in front of steel furnaces while maintaining a harmonious family.'
p16380
aS'But it was a cherry-picking approach that focused exclusively on bringing women into the work force and neglected their experiences in other realms.'
p16381
aS'Visitors to rural areas saw peasant wives toiling around the clock: cooking, mending clothes and feeding livestock after finishing a day of work in the fields.'
p16382
aS'Their plight shocked the urban youth who were sent down to the countryside during the Cultural Revolution, such that Naihua Zhang, a sociology professor at Florida Atlantic University who spent time in the countryside as a young woman in that era, equated rural marriage with a total erasure of women\xe2\x80\x99s identity.'
p16383
aS'Researchers also observed that after marriage factory women often experienced slower career advancement than men as they became saddled with domestic responsibilities that left them with little time to learn new skills and take on extra work, both prerequisites for promotion.'
p16384
aS'State services that promised to ease their burden, like public child care centers, were in reality few and far between.'
p16385
aS'Unlike their counterparts in developed countries, Chinese women didn\xe2\x80\x99t have labor-saving household appliances, since Mao\xe2\x80\x99s economic policies prioritized heavy industry over the production of consumer products like washing machines and dishwashers.'
p16386
aS'Some Western scholars have said these realities amounted to a "revolution postponed".'
p16387
aS'Yet the conclusions of researchers were contradicted by none other than Chinese women themselves.'
p16388
aS'During her field study in China in 1970s, Margery Wolf, who was an anthropology professor at University of Iowa, was surprised by how effusive Chinese women were about the miracle of female emancipation in the very presence of their continued oppression.'
p16389
aS'"It was easy to take gender equality \xe2\x80\x94 an ideal that was widely promoted \xe2\x80\x94 as the reality and regard problems as reminiscent of old systems and ideology that would erode with time," said Professor Zhang, the sociologist.'
p16390
aS'The state rolled out propaganda campaigns aimed at not only enlisting women in the work force but also shaping their self-perception.'
p16391
aS'Posters, textbooks and newspapers propagated images and narratives that, devoid of any particularities of personal experiences, depicted women as men\xe2\x80\x99s equal in outlook, value and achievement.'
p16392
aS'For women in the workplace to adhere to this narrowly defined acceptable female image meant to see, understand and speak about their life not as it was, but as what it ought to be according to the party ideal.'
p16393
aS'It is a measure of the campaign\xe2\x80\x99s success that women who publicly described their experiences in the Mao era did so exclusively in official rhetoric.'
p16394
aS'Elisabeth Croll, an anthropologist specializing in Chinese women, observed that all published accounts of Chinese women\xe2\x80\x99s lives during the early decades of the People\xe2\x80\x99s Republic followed the standard narrative of their rise from mistreated wives and daughters to independent, socialist workers; it had become the story of practically every woman.'
p16395
aS'Forty years after Mao\xe2\x80\x99s death, this aspect of his legacy is still understood through his famous pronouncement on gender equality, "Women hold up half the sky".'
p16396
aS'It is a slogan my grandmother utters in the same breath as the chairman\xe2\x80\x99s other sins and deeds.'
p16397
aS'She does not mention the arduous work of managing a household and raising three children amid tumultuous revolutionary campaigns.'
p16398
aS'Nor does she complain about how she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t join the party because of her husband\xe2\x80\x99s unpopular political affiliations.'
p16399
aS'She gives only a chuckle when she recalls the exhortations she once received from party superiors to marry just as her career was taking off.'
p16400
aS'For all its flaws, the Communist revolution taught Chinese women to dream big.'
p16401
aS'When it came to advice for my mother, my grandmother applauded her daughter\xe2\x80\x99s decision to go to graduate school and urged her to find a husband who would be supportive of her career.'
p16402
aS'She still seems to think that the new market economy \xe2\x80\x94 with its meritocracy and freedom of choice \xe2\x80\x94 will finally allow women to be masters of their minds and actions.'
p16403
aS'After all, she has always said to my mother, "you have more opportunities".'
p16404
aS'Ren\xc3\xa9 Descartes has long been credited with the near-single-handed creation of modern philosophy.'
p16405
aS'Generations of students have read, and continue to read, his famous "Meditations" as the rejection of medieval ways of thinking and the invention of the modern self.'
p16406
aS'They learned that he doubted all traditional ways of knowing before pivoting to the modern subjective individual.'
p16407
aS'Tumbling into a "deep whirlpool," the doubter of the "Meditations" has no secure footing until he hits upon a single firm and indubitable truth: He is most essentially "a thinking thing".'
p16408
aS'The modern individual is born, with the rejection of the past as its midwife.'
p16409
aS'It\xe2\x80\x99s a dramatic story.'
p16410
aS'But it\xe2\x80\x99s false.'
p16411
aS'Descartes\xe2\x80\x99s contemporaries in the 17th century would have been stunned to hear these accomplishments credited to him.'
p16412
aS'Although he was rightly famous in his time for some of his scientific and mathematical ideas, many considered his philosophical proposals about the radical difference between mind and body implausible and unoriginal.'
p16413
aS'Even his scientific ideas were often ranked on par with others.'
p16414
aS'For example, the English philosopher   considered Hobbes\xe2\x80\x99s and Spinoza\xe2\x80\x99s account of corporeal nature to be equally influential, and similarly mistaken.'
p16415
aS'Another contemporary, the German Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, agreed, sometimes comparing Descartes\xe2\x80\x99s proposals to those of long-forgotten thinkers like  .'
p16416
aS'Others noted his debt to past thinkers.'
p16417
aS'In his "Dictionary," Pierre Bayle writes of complaints about Descartes\xe2\x80\x99s "pirating" of ideas from earlier sources.'
p16418
aS'Fast forward a century or so to Kant, who does not consider the author of the "Meditations" to be worth much attention.'
p16419
aS'So if Descartes did not invent modern philosophy, how was this false narrative created and sustained?'
p16420
aS'The longstanding story about Descartes\xe2\x80\x99s creation of a "new philosophy" that broke radically with medieval "ways of thinking" and that marked "the dawn of modern times" was promoted by philosophers who came after Kant and who, oddly enough, turned Descartes into the originator of "Germanic" thought.'
p16421
aS'In his 1820s lectures on the history of philosophy, Hegel asserts that "Germanic, i. e., modern philosophy begins with Descartes".'
p16422
aS'By 1847, Schopenhauer insists "our excellent Descartes" is "the instigator of subjective investigation and in this the father of modern philosophy".'
p16423
aS'A prominent German professor, Kuno Fischer (1824 -1907), published a gripping (and multivolume) story in the 1870s about Descartes\xe2\x80\x99s groundbreaking ideas and their impact on subsequent thought.'
p16424
aS'In a revealing passage from his extended discussion of Descartes\xe2\x80\x99s life and innovations, Fischer writes: "In the whole range of philosophical literature, there is no work in which the struggle for truth is portrayed in a more animated, personal, captivating manner and, at the same time, more simply and clearly, than in Descartes\xe2\x80\x99s essay on method and his first \xe2\x80\x98Meditation. \xe2\x80\x99 " This 19th-century invention of the "modern era" excised 17th- and 18th-century philosophy of its theological and religious underpinnings \xe2\x80\x94 and its women, whether they were overtly theological or not.'
p16425
aS'Even influential Enlightenment figures like the natural philosopher,  , were ignored, not to mention the contributions of significant 17th-century radical thinkers like   and Anne Conway, a favorite of Leibniz.'
p16426
aS'The adulation continued into the early 20th century, when Descartes\xe2\x80\x99s heroism was codified by prominent thinkers like the German Ernst Cassirer (1874-1945) and the French \xc3\x89tienne Gilson (1884-1978).'
p16427
aS'In Cassirer\xe2\x80\x99s dramatic telling, Descartes single-handedly created the "spiritual essence" of a new epoch, which would "permeate all fields of knowledge," to which 18th-century philosophers responded, and out of which Kant and other German thinkers would arise as liberating angels.'
p16428
aS'Based on his interpretation of the 17th century as a period of "great metaphysical systems" developed in response to Descartes, Cassirer advised historians to "string its various intellectual formulations along the thread of time and study them chronologically".'
p16429
aS'That is, in order to understand "the sum total" of the period\xe2\x80\x99s "philosophical content," it was sufficient to track its systems "lengthwise".'
p16430
aS'And so people did.'
p16431
aS'One of the most influential treatments of the history of philosophy in the English speaking world is the hugely ambitious and admirably clear study by Frederick Copleston, an Oxford trained classicist who converted to Catholicism, became a Jesuit priest, and famously debated his friend A. J. Ayer as well as Bertrand Russell on philosophical and theological matters.'
p16432
aS'In elegant concise prose, Copleston kept to the lengthwise approach, displaying the whole history of philosophy in nine volumes, published between 1946\xe2\x80\x9375 and widely read in the English-speaking world.'
p16433
aS'Although Copleston includes mystics like   (1260-1328) and prominent Jesuit scholastics like Francisco   (1548\xe2\x80\x931617), he entirely ignores the richly philosophical spiritual writings of even the most prominent late medieval women, reducing the entirety of philosophy to a series of great men, each responding to the ones who went before.'
p16434
aS'Analytically trained historians working in the mid-20th century were satisfied to rummage through the "great systems" of the canonical great men to find their philosophical gems.'
p16435
aS'And who can blame them?'
p16436
aS'From Bertrand Russell\xe2\x80\x99s book on Leibniz (1900) to Peter Strawson\xe2\x80\x99s study of Kant (1966), prominent philosophers could grind their own philosophical axes using historical texts.'
p16437
aS'They felt justified in restricting themselves to the standard story about modern philosophy and its limited range of problems, to which they could apply their philosophical tools with the hope of producing innovative ideas and arguments for themselves and their colleagues.'
p16438
aS'One did not need to worry one\xe2\x80\x99s head with the social and political complications of early modern Europe, much less dirty one\xe2\x80\x99s hands with the messiness of its theology.'
p16439
aS'One could focus on what   to properly educated philosophers.'
p16440
aS'This approach was doomed to fail.'
p16441
aS'The richness and diversity of early modern philosophy were bound to become evident, engendering a growing awareness of the inadequacy of the standard story.'
p16442
aS'The engendering of that inadequacy was itself gendered.'
p16443
aS'When feminist scholars in the 1980s began to explore early modern women writers, they discovered both the richness of the period\xe2\x80\x99s philosophy and the inadequacy of the lengthwise approach.'
p16444
aS'Scholars like Eileen O\xe2\x80\x99Neill dared historians to widen their scope and include long-forgotten figures, foreseeing how women\xe2\x80\x99s philosophies would offer significant insights into the period\xe2\x80\x99s central debates.'
p16445
aS'This strategy has produced significant results and begun to influence the way historians of philosophy think about the period.'
p16446
aS'Most relevant to the reconsideration of Descartes and the subjective individual that he was supposed to have invented is the recent recognition that late medieval spiritual meditations \xe2\x80\x94 especially those written by women like Julian of Norwich, Hadewijch of Brabant, Catherine of Siena and Teresa of \xc3\x81vila \xe2\x80\x94 involved the need to focus on the meditator\xe2\x80\x99s subjectivity as a means to rethink everything the meditator has previously learned about the world.'
p16447
aS'The point was to learn not to   about the external matters so as to develop new habits and beliefs.'
p16448
aS'For most meditators, the only proper means to do this was through subjective exploration.'
p16449
aS'Longstanding prejudice against women, their capacities to reason, and their right to teach had left women out of philosophy for centuries.'
p16450
aS'But the 12th century witnessed the beginning of a shift to meditative practices emphasizing introspection and feelings.'
p16451
aS'Although created by men, the new forms of spiritual practice gave women the right, for the first time in centuries to write and be read.'
p16452
aS'Because women were considered naturally predisposed to emotive introspection, their spiritual writings began to be taken seriously.'
p16453
aS'In constant fear of overstepping their bounds, these authors had to find imaginative ways to share their insights while seeming suitably humble.'
p16454
aS'For example, Julian of Norwich writes in late 14th-century England, "Just because I am a woman, must I \xe2\x80\xa6 not tell you about the goodness of God, when I saw \xe2\x80\xa6 his wish that it should be known"?'
p16455
aS'Women like Julian had to admit their "natural" inferiority and practice their philosophy within the confines of this emotive spiritual genre.'
p16456
aS'And so they did, brilliantly, writing carefully in their meditations about the subjective individual who doubts everything she was previously taught before progressing to self-knowledge and eventually to truth.'
p16457
aS'It is here in the spiritual writings of late medieval women that we find many of the features that Hegel and Schopenhauer considered new and "Germanic".'
p16458
aS'To be sure, the steps in Descartes\xe2\x80\x99s "Meditations" are rendered in more explicitly epistemological terms than those of his predecessors, but his strategy and pivot to self-knowledge were already at the time centuries old.'
p16459
aS'It is no wonder his contemporaries were not very impressed.'
p16460
aS'Our understanding of history evolves.'
p16461
aS'We can now see Descartes as the benefactor of a long tradition, to which women significantly contributed.'
p16462
aS'The time seems right to rethink the role of women and other noncanonical figures in the history of philosophy and begin to create a more accurate story about philosophy\xe2\x80\x99s rich and diverse past.'

aS'The presence of heterosexual families in schools also exposes gay families to these unpleasant concepts.'

aS'\xe2\x80\x94 In December 1953, the inaugural issue of Playboy magazine hit newsstands without a date.'
p16888
aS'Hugh Hefner, its creator, was unsure whether it would be a success and have a future, so by withholding the date he hoped he could continue to sell that issue until he sold out of that first run.'
p16889
aS'Mr. Hefner, who  , had nothing to worry about.'
p16890
aS'In its prime, the magazine ranked among America\xe2\x80\x99s top-selling publications, alongside Life and Time, sometimes beating their subscription rates.'
p16891
aS'The magazine, intended for men, quickly transcended Mr. Hefner\xe2\x80\x99s target audience, with a subscriber base that cut across gender, race, class and ideology.'
p16892
aS'Today it\xe2\x80\x99s easy to write off Playboy, and Mr. Hefner, as the last remnants of a more sexist age.'
p16893
aS'But seen from the perspective of the 1950s and \xe2\x80\x9960s, they were progressive icons \xe2\x80\x94 not just in the libertine styles they promoted, but in the causes that they featured.'
p16894
aS'The magazine became central to what it meant to be a modern man.'
p16895
aS'The masculine ideal of the era was narrowly defined: aloof, outdoorsy, a breadwinner, "manly".'
p16896
aS'Showing too much of an interest in culture, fine food or travel was anathema.'
p16897
aS'Mr. Hefner felt trapped by conformity and designed a magazine that promoted a very different idea of what made an individual a "man" through its features and advice on clothing, food, alcohol selections, art, music and literature.'
p16898
aS'Though it quickly became a clich\xc3\xa9, many male readers really did "read it for the articles," telling surveys that they enjoyed features on the ideal bachelor pad even more than the centerfold.'
p16899
aS'Of course, Playboy was never just about the articles.'
p16900
aS'From the beginning, its goal was to combine and appeal to men\xe2\x80\x99s entire range of interests \xe2\x80\x94 the intellectual, the entertaining and the erotic.'
p16901
aS'Hence the Playboy Playmate, which Mr. Hefner modeled after Esquire\xe2\x80\x99s Vargas Girls, popular among servicemen during World War II.'
p16902
aS'Women in the magazine, he said, were intended more as the girl next door than as sex objects.'
p16903
aS'Still, the fact that they were often topless (full nudity didn\xe2\x80\x99t appear until 1972) brought criticism that Mr. Hefner objectified women; promoted an unrealistic standard of female beauty; and promulgated the idea that women should be subservient playmates for the modern man.'
p16904
aS'To Mr. Hefner, women were simply one of the interests of most heterosexual men.'
p16905
aS'The magazine featured discussions of equal rights, contraception and reproductive choice.'
p16906
aS'Mr. Hefner never saw that as a contradiction.'
p16907
aS'As the magazine\xe2\x80\x99s editorial style evolved, Mr. Hefner and his editors delved more into politics and current events.'
p16908
aS'By the 1960s, he was writing a frequent installment, "The Playboy Philosophy," in which he addressed topics like the First Amendment and sexual mores.'
p16909
aS'He advocated gay rights.'
p16910
aS'He pushed for women\xe2\x80\x99s access to birth control and abortion.'
p16911
aS'He discussed censorship as well as what constituted "obscene" in the United States, and he promoted the free exchange of thoughts and ideas.'
p16912
aS'And readers responded.'
p16913
aS'So many wrote in that the magazine created "The Playboy Forum," where it published readers\xe2\x80\x99 letters discussing the content of the "Philosophy".'
p16914
aS'Playboy became more than just a magazine, but a place that facilitated dialogue among a wide variety of readers: Men, women, veterans, draft dodgers, congressmen and clergy all wrote into the Forum.'
p16915
aS'Mr. Hefner went beyond the pages of Playboy to spread his message.'
p16916
aS'He created the Playboy Club franchise to bring the atmosphere of the magazine to life for its readers.'
p16917
aS'They could buy good food, good liquor and good entertainment.'
p16918
aS'He integrated his staff and membership; he hired men and women of all races, and often provided black comedians and musicians their first chances to perform in front of white audiences.'
p16919
aS'When a New Orleans and Miami club owner segregated the membership, Mr. Hefner bought those franchises back.'
p16920
aS'The clubs provided female employees with tuition reimbursement and encouraged them to attend college.'
p16921
aS'Mr. Hefner also set up the Playboy Foundation, which supported First Amendment rights, often contributing to defendants in free-speech cases.'
p16922
aS'The foundation went on to support other works, including research on post-traumatic stress disorder, commissions on Agent Orange and programs and organizations for veterans.'
p16923
aS'Those latter causes were no coincidence: Playboy played a major role in the American war in Vietnam.'
p16924
aS'For hundreds of thousands of young men "in country" \xe2\x80\x94 their average age was 19 \xe2\x80\x94 the magazine made them feel as if they were back home.'
p16925
aS'The centerfold pages hung on tent flaps and office walls, and could be found stashed in pockets, helmets and packs.'
p16926
aS'The interest went beyond the women: Young soldiers eagerly perused the glossy advertisements for the latest stereos, cars and fashion, which they could buy at one of the mall-like PXs on the military\xe2\x80\x99s sprawling bases (yes, even cars, which the government would ship home).'
p16927
aS'It acted as a how-to guide for consumption and consumerism for many young men who had never had disposable income before.'
p16928
aS'Articles and interviews in the magazine were some of their only sources of real news about the growing antiwar and counterculture movements stateside.'
p16929
aS'They went beyond the headlines, too, discussing and critiquing strategy, the draft and the politicians who moved the chess pieces.'
p16930
aS'But the magazine also remained supportive of the men fighting the war.'
p16931
aS'Countless letters from servicemen to the magazine, now stored in the Playboy archives, reveal how much the magazine lifted morale, how it brought a welcome respite from the boredom, terror and chaos they endured on a daily basis.'
p16932
aS'While the magazine deserved criticism, its evolution reflected changing norms and values in American society.'
p16933
aS'In August 1967, a soldier named Donald Iasillo wrote to Playboy thanking the magazine for literally saving his life.'
p16934
aS'An issue folded in his chest pocket had prevented a bullet from entering his heart.'
p16935
aS'"Usually for reasons other than its value as armor plate, Playboy is by far the biggest morale booster in Vietnam," he wrote.'
p16936
aS'"For this, we  thank you".'
p16937
aS'In a typical year, the University of California, Berkeley, allocates around $200,000 to pay for security at campus protests.'
p16938
aS'But since this past February, the school has spent some  .'
p16939
aS'That enormous sum excludes the $1 million the administration expected to spend this week on Milo Yiannopoulos\xe2\x80\x99s chaotic and disorganized "Free Speech Week".'
p16940
aS'Free Speech Week was supposed to be a four-day rally that brought in big-name provocateurs like Ann Coulter and Steve Bannon.'
p16941
aS'But although Mr. Yiannopoulos spent lots of energy  , he appears to have spent very little planning it.'
p16942
aS'He and the Berkeley Patriot, the student group hosting his event, failed to confirm most of their speakers, including Ms. Coulter and Mr. Bannon, and they never filed the paperwork necessary to book campus venues.'
p16943
aS'On Friday, the Berkeley Patriot pulled its support for the event entirely.'
p16944
aS'Predictably, Mr. Yiannopoulos declared at a   on Saturday that the Berkeley administration did "everything in its power to crush its own students\xe2\x80\x99 aspirations" to host his event, and vowed nevertheless to speak on Berkeley\xe2\x80\x99s Sproul Plaza "come hell or high water".'
p16945
aS'The school still expects to spend a handsome sum to secure the unsponsored event.'
p16946
aS'If that seems unwarranted, consider that Berkeley has had to essentially soldier up for unexpectedly violent rallies in their public plaza many times this year.'
p16947
aS'This is a huge distraction for a university already struggling to reduce a crippling budget deficit of $150 million.'
p16948
aS'And it raises a thorny question for those who believe that free speech should trump all else: Should public institutions be spending taxpayer money allocated for higher education on speakers who aren\xe2\x80\x99t there for teaching and learning?'
p16949
aS'I\xe2\x80\x99m intimately familiar with the right-wing tactic of framing anything less than free speech absolutism as "against free speech," in part because I   this tactic as a conservative college student.'
p16950
aS'It\xe2\x80\x99s easy to declare that if low-value speakers like Mr. Yiannopoulos want a campus platform, it\xe2\x80\x99s censorship if a school doesn\xe2\x80\x99t give them one.'
p16951
aS'But as we are seeing with Berkeley, the reality is that "free speech on campus" is not resource-neutral.'
p16952
aS'Indeed, in an effort to make sure Free Speech Week could go on, Janet Napolitano, the president of University of California, even offered to chip in at least $300,000 to help with security.'
p16953
aS'"It\xe2\x80\x99s a cost that the university is bearing to protect the speakers but also to protect the value of free speech," she said.'
p16954
aS'That\xe2\x80\x99s a bold statement from Ms. Napolitano, as security concerns about Mr. Yiannopoulos\xe2\x80\x99s event resulted in the postponement of a previously scheduled talk by Anna Tsing, a leading anthropologist.'
p16955
aS'I doubt Ms. Tsing\xe2\x80\x99s anthropology lecture would have cost Berkeley and the University of California system anywhere near $1 million.'
p16956
aS'And I suspect that if Ms. Tsing were sharing the campus with a conservative like Yuval Levin or Walter Williams on the same day, neither speech would have to be canceled.'
p16957
aS'Which is why spending seven figures\xe2\x80\x99 worth of student fees and taxpayer money to host Mr. Yiannopoulos is less about defending free speech than it is about supporting provocation for its own sake.'
p16958
aS'Undoubtedly, left-wing "antifa" groups have contributed to the security risks and costs at Berkeley, taking the bait that speakers like Mr. Yiannopoulos lay out and   far-right militia groups who  .'
p16959
aS'But we should keep in mind, as the historian Mark Bray  , that antifa groups form specifically to counter white supremacist and Nazi violence, having done so from the days of Hitler and Mussolini.'
p16960
aS'Antifa groups are a symptom, not a cause, of the threat of white supremacist violence.'
p16961
aS'For the most part, both sides have little to do with college students who are, by and large, angry to see their campus overrun by outsiders.'
p16962
aS'Universities have a duty to keep campuses safe, not in the service of paternalism, but in the service of providing a suitable learning environment for students.'
p16963
aS'It\xe2\x80\x99s easy to claim that denying a speaker \xe2\x80\x94 even one like Mr. Yiannopoulos or Richard Spencer \xe2\x80\x94 is a kind of epistemological harm that makes students worse off.'
p16964
aS'But so too are the acts of shutting down popular facilities for security purposes, and bringing in less-experienced security personnel who   violence with students, and transforming the campus into a microcosm of a police state.'
p16965
aS'The question of which campus speakers warrant security funding is real and challenging \xe2\x80\x94 especially considering that a speech by Ben Shapiro, a mainstream conservative who used to speak at Berkeley with barely a mention, recently cost the school $600,000 in security expenses.'
p16966
aS'But the escalation of security costs isn\xe2\x80\x99t a response to conservative thought.'
p16967
aS'It is the only way schools can respond to a deliberate right-wing strategy, driven by outside groups, to inflict disruptive and deliberately offensive speakers on campuses, and thus bait the left into outrage.'
p16968
aS'The audience for right-wing speakers like Mr. Yiannopoulos is not college students themselves, but rather the culture warriors on either side of the aisle who respond to seeing campus communities in distress.'
p16969
aS'It\xe2\x80\x99s true that we\xe2\x80\x99re hearing fewer cries of campus censorship since   universities denied Mr. Spencer a speaking engagement after his "Unite the Right" rally in Charlottesville, Va., in August turned violent and deadly.'
p16970
aS'But we shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be fooled into thinking that the only problem with a speaker like Mr. Spencer is the offensiveness of his views.'
p16971
aS'It may feel easier to draw the line at Nazis and overt white supremacists, but that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t excuse us from thinking seriously \xe2\x80\x94 as we should have a long time ago \xe2\x80\x94 about educational standards for who deserves a college platform and financial resources.'
p16972
aS'Whereas conservatives politicians have traditionally warned against reckless public spending, in some cases by attempting to   entire academic divisions and programs, they\xe2\x80\x99re suddenly urging public institutions to hand over their wallets to bring a person to campus who\xe2\x80\x99s known for   to publicly mock them during his talks.'
p16973
aS'Mr. Yiannopoulos has already   two Berkeley students he disagrees with, posting their photos and identifying information on social media, which puts these students in direct danger of being harassed and threatened.'
p16974
aS'When speakers like these cost hundreds of thousands of dollars but add scant academic value, the issue is more complicated than the radical or offensive nature of their views.'
p16975
aS'We do need more conservative voices on campus.'
p16976
aS'But a free speech movement that has elevated expensive provocateurs over conservative intellectuals has only undermined the cause of campus intellectual diversity.'
p16977
aS'As anticipated, Angela Merkel\xe2\x80\x99s party came in first in the German national election on Sunday, assuring her of a fourth term as chancellor.'
p16978
aS'That much was foreordained, even if Ms. Merkel\xe2\x80\x99s center-right Christian Democrats and their Bavarian allies came in slightly below expectations, with roughly a third of the vote.'
p16979
aS'Ms. Merkel\xe2\x80\x99s bland slogan \xe2\x80\x94 "For a Germany where life is good and we enjoy it" \xe2\x80\x94 summed up a campaign that promised to continue the reassuring blend of moderation, stability, dignity and determined centrism that "Mutti" (mommy) has steadfastly pursued in an era of extremist politics.'
p16980
aS'It was reassuring, too, for the outside world, in which the chancellor has provided consistent leadership in European integration, compassion toward refugees, liberal democracy and Western values.'
p16981
aS'But in a country where coalition governments are the norm, voting is only the start of a process that can take months before a government emerges.'
p16982
aS'Here Ms. Merkel faces a formidable challenge.'
p16983
aS'For starters, for the first time in German post-World War II history, a far-right, anti-Muslim, anti-European Union party \xe2\x80\x94 the Alternative for Germany \xe2\x80\x94 garnered enough votes, more than 13 percent, to enter Parliament.'
p16984
aS'That in itself is not surprising at a time when populist parties have made gains across Europe and in the United States.'
p16985
aS'But the emergence of a nationalist party, one of whose leaders thinks Germans should be proud of their soldiers in both world wars, has been a source of distress.'
p16986
aS'The politically greater challenge before Ms. Merkel is the loss of her coalition partner, the Social Democrats, whose years in coalition with Ms. Merkel\xe2\x80\x99s conservative C.D.U. eroded their socialist identity.'
p16987
aS'Ms. Merkel has little choice but to seek a coalition with the Greens and the pro-business Free Democratic Party.'
p16988
aS'Joining with two such diverse parties will take some complex horse trading, and the resulting team could prove unstable.'
p16989
aS'In her victory statement, Ms. Merkel spoke of bringing back the discontented voters who cast their ballots for Alternative for Germany.'
p16990
aS'Hopefully, that goal \xe2\x80\x94 and negotiations with potential coalition partners \xe2\x80\x94 will not entail erosion of the values the chancellor has defended in the past.'
p16991
aS'Since accepting more than a million refugees in 2015, Ms. Merkel\xe2\x80\x99s government sharply reduced the flow, partly through a deal with Turkey that has been criticized by human rights groups.'
p16992
aS'Her handling of that, or any challenge she has faced, is open to criticism.'
p16993
aS'But her non-ideological leadership has helped Germany, Europe and the world.'
p16994
aS'Its continuation counterbalances the demagogy loosed on the world.'
p16995
aS'Jann Wenner, the founder of Rolling Stone magazine, announced a few days ago that he was putting his company\xe2\x80\x99s controlling stake in the longtime music publication up for sale.'
p16996
aS'For many, it feels like the end of an era, but especially for me.'
p16997
aS'I worked there in the early 1990s, as an intern and then as an editorial assistant.'
p16998
aS'It\xe2\x80\x99s where I learned how to be a journalist \xe2\x80\x94 and, to a greater extent than I realized at the time, it\xe2\x80\x99s where I learned how to be an American.'
p16999
aS'In the summer of 1992, as part of the requirements for my journalism degree at the University of Maryland, College Park, I applied for an internship at a few publications, including Rolling Stone.'
p17000
aS'At the time, the magazine was widely regarded as the leading cultural magazine in America.'
p17001
aS'The coolest thing I could imagine was to work there \xe2\x80\x94 even if I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t get paid.'
p17002
aS'When I got the internship, I packed my bags and moved to New York without a moment\xe2\x80\x99s thought, leaving my boyfriend behind.'
p17003
aS'I grew up in Lebanon and moved to the United States as a teenager, and when I arrived in New York my understanding of the country was still taking shape; I was still grappling with the complicated set of rules that governed American culture, so different from what I had imagined as a child, gorging on American film, TV shows and music in the embattled Beirut of the 1970s and \xe2\x80\x9980s.'
p17004
aS'The road to success, I quickly realized, was not a straight shot but a windy, often hard to see or follow thruway.'
p17005
aS'And another thing: America had yet to become the feminist Eden I was so eager to inhabit.'
p17006
aS'These, and many others, aren\xe2\x80\x99t the sorts of things I picked up on overnight.'
p17007
aS'But I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t have chosen a better place to begin unpacking them than Rolling Stone in the early 1990s.'
p17008
aS'I felt instantly at home.'
p17009
aS'I thought at the time that I was not learning much, sifting through daily newspapers for articles the editors might want to read, but it provided me with a front view of American culture \xe2\x80\x94 both the day-to-day culture of a professional American work environment, and the unfolding of the culture at large through the production of one of its most famous magazines.'
p17010
aS'The internship\xe2\x80\x99s three months went by fast, and I was soon back at school.'
p17011
aS'But a few days after I graduated the following December, I was in New York again, desperately hoping to be hired at Rolling Stone.'
p17012
aS'Three agonizing months later, an editorial assistant position opened up at the magazine.'
p17013
aS'I applied and got it.'
p17014
aS'By then, Rolling Stone was no longer the subversive publication it started out as back in 1967, but it was still far from a regular working environment.'
p17015
aS'On any given day, Eddie Vedder, Anthony Kiedis, Mick Jagger, Tom Cruise or John F. Kennedy Jr. might drop by.'
p17016
aS'My cubicle was the closest to Mr. Wenner\xe2\x80\x99s office, so I had a front-row seat to the comings and goings.'
p17017
aS'Whenever a celebrity visited, I would suddenly become the most popular person in the office, with everyone rushing to my desk to "chat" as they ogled the latest high-profile guest.'
p17018
aS'In between short bouts of actual work, I would huddle with a group of fellow employees to discuss the latest movie or book or concert that we had attended the previous night, with free tickets thanks to the generosity (and busyness) of David Fricke, the legendary Ramones-look-alike music editor; Anthony DeCurtis, the editor of the music review section; and Sid Holt, the de facto head editor of the magazine and my immediate boss.'
p17019
aS'I would often saunter to the office of my other immediate boss, Peter Travers, Rolling Stone\xe2\x80\x99s widely quoted film reviewer, hoping to talk movies.'
p17020
aS'I still cringe at my dismissal of the 1995 Todd Haynes film, "Safe," starring Julianne Moore, proclaiming it tedious and pointless in front of Mr. Travers, who, for good reasons defended it \xe2\x80\x94 and, I am sure, thought the less of me for not being able to understand its cinematic and philosophical intentions.'
p17021
aS'But I have no residue of shame for panning the insufferable "Happy Gilmore" \xe2\x80\x94 this was before Adam Sandler redeemed himself by starring in Paul Thomas Anderson\xe2\x80\x99s "Punch-Drunk Love" \xe2\x80\x94 which represented to me the most inane aspects of American culture.'
p17022
aS'Along with my secretarial responsibilities I ran the letters page and the table of contents, which meant it was my blessed duty to read everything we published.'
p17023
aS'The magazine had published the works of some of the best-known journalists of the 20th century, such as Greil Marcus, Hunter S. Thompson, Lester Bangs and Cameron Crowe, and many were still contributing \xe2\x80\x94 sometimes, on my lucky days, they visited, too.'
p17024
aS'It had also brought on many new writers, some of whom, such as Chris Mundy, Jancee Dunn and Kim Neely, became my own writing icons.'
p17025
aS'All three sat near me, and I would watch with great envy as they headed out of the office, sometimes for a few hours, often for days, to interview the person who would soon grace our cover.'
p17026
aS'Mr. Holt oversaw my editorial duties, and we often sat together to devise the table of contents.'
p17027
aS'It was during these sessions that I learned the power of the em dash in American writing, a device I now use \xe2\x80\x94 and abuse \xe2\x80\x94 in my own writing.'
p17028
aS'Though negligible by then, my Lebanese accent sometimes poked its head, often when pronouncing a word that I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t practiced enough.'
p17029
aS'At the time, Rolling Stone was trying to shift with the times.'
p17030
aS'It embraced shows like "Friends," provocatively running a photo of a naked Jennifer Aniston on its cover, and began championing the grunge phenomenon.'
p17031
aS'I still clearly remember the day news reached us that Kurt Cobain was dead, and the gloom that pervaded our offices.'
p17032
aS'We received the news the way many Americans reacted to the death of John F. Kennedy: with utter shock and a sense of despondency.'
p17033
aS'Still, the 1990s were, to a large extent, hopeful times.'
p17034
aS'America was moving forward, with Bill Clinton in the lead.'
p17035
aS'I stayed hopeful too, despite not being able to quickly move up the Rolling Stone masthead, as I had foolishly expected to.'
p17036
aS'Three years later, eager to jump-start my own writing career, and convinced that my meager supply of published profiles and film reviews for independent, small outlets (which, like so many of their ilk are now defunct) was enough, I quit my full-time job at Rolling Stone.'
p17037
aS'I remained umbilically tied to the publication.'
p17038
aS'Some of my best friends, whom I see to this day, still worked there, and I occasionally returned to freelance at the magazine as a fact-checker.'
p17039
aS'That tie was severed in the early 2000s after my friends left, and I took a full-time job elsewhere.'
p17040
aS'I have not set foot in the magazine\xe2\x80\x99s offices since.'
p17041
aS'In the past decade, like nearly every publication, Rolling Stone has struggled to stay afloat.'
p17042
aS'Its impending sale is because of several things, including the current state of journalism and the magazine\xe2\x80\x99s inability to attract enough new readers.'
p17043
aS'But it is also hurting from the millions of dollars it had to pay in damages after its publication of a piece on college rape, which was later discredited and retracted.'
p17044
aS'No doubt its decision to go through with that piece was motivated by the desire to stay relevant.'
p17045
aS'But at a time when there is no center for anything \xe2\x80\x94 politics, music, visual arts or film \xe2\x80\x94 the drive for relevance can be its own sort of death knell.'
p17046
aS'Of course, even after its sale, Rolling Stone might still have a long life ahead.'
p17047
aS'Whatever happens, its mark will live on with at least one former employee.'
p17048
aS'When Sadiq Khan, the Labour mayor of London, stands in front of the annual gathering of his party\xe2\x80\x99s activists next week, he can be confident that his speech will have at least one applause line: He is the politician who took on Uber.'
p17049
aS'On Friday morning, Transport for London, the not-for-profit company that runs and regulates transport in the capital, made the surprise announcement that Uber, the company that likes to call itself a "ridesharing app," would not have its license to operate in London  .'
p17050
aS'Mr. Khan immediately released a statement supporting the decision, saying that all London businesses needed to " ".'
p17051
aS'It\xe2\x80\x99s a sentiment that will be echoed by the Labour Party\xe2\x80\x99s leader, Jeremy Corbyn, a left-wing populist who has often criticized big business.'
p17052
aS'Last year, when the Labour leader claimed he had to sit on the floor of a "ram-packed" train, and used the opportunity to call for the renationalization of Britain\xe2\x80\x99s railways, it led to   between Mr. Corbyn and Virgin trains, which operates the service and released CCTV images showing Mr. Corbyn bypassing vacant seats \xe2\x80\x94 but that row only burnished Mr. Corbyn\xe2\x80\x99s anti-establishment credentials.'
p17053
aS'Sticking it to a Silicon Valley start-up will play equally well with Labour\xe2\x80\x99s activist base.'
p17054

aS'Why?'
p17140
aS'Because there was ample evidence that he exhibited C.T.E. characteristics before and after he was charged with killing his friend, Odin Lloyd, and, statistically, as a college and professional player, there was no surprise in his C.T.E. diagnosis.'

aS'The government also provided a theory to establish Mr. Hernandez\xe2\x80\x99s motive to kill Mr. Lloyd \xe2\x80\x94 anger over gossip \xe2\x80\x94 and his ample opportunity to premeditate and deliberate.'

p17433
aS'm., President Enrique Pe\xc3\xb1a Nieto of Mexico was doing what every Mexican president has done for the past 32 years at that time: He was in El Z\xc3\xb3calo, the capital\xe2\x80\x99s main square, to raise the national flag at half-mast in commemoration of the victims of the big earthquake of 1985.'
p17434
aS'At exactly 11 a.'
p17435
aS'm., the rest of us also did the same thing we have done at that moment since 1985: When the seismic alarm sounded for a drill, we all got up from our chairs and went through the motions we have learned to execute in an evacuation.'

aS'The lake was drained and tubed, and for nearly five centuries now, we have lived with water underneath us.'
p17449
aS'That water means not only that Mexico City floods easily and that some parts of it are sinking, by as much as 10 centimeters every year.'
p17450
aS'The water also amplifies the effects of every earthquake that hits us.'

p17458
aS'They carried water, food and medicine.'
p17459
aS'They brought shovels to remove debris.'

aS'They lined up to get into trucks and buses that would take them to neighborhoods where help was most needed.'
p17461
aS'They opened up their homes to people who had lost theirs.'

aS'In Delaware, our economic development office, with my full approval, was busy calculating direct subsidies to corporations through grants and tax breaks.'
p17470
aS'I was as guilty as any elected official at playing this game.'
p17471
aS'But it\xe2\x80\x99s a game that should stop.'
p17472
aS'There\xe2\x80\x99s a better way to compete for business.'
p17473
aS'A New York Times investigation in 2012 found that states, counties and cities   more than $80 billion a year in incentives to attract and retain companies.'
p17474
aS'Amazon, for example, has already benefited from hundreds of millions of dollars in public subsidies as it expanded its warehouse network around the country, according to a report last year by the Institute for Local Self-Reliance.'
p17475
aS'The company\xe2\x80\x99s   seeks a combination of the types of direct payments that governors and mayors regularly make to businesses: incentives to reduce initial capital costs, relocation and work force grants, tax credits and exemptions, reduction of other fees and assistance with utility costs.'
p17476
aS'In Delaware, despite some notable failed investments (especially trying to save a closed General Motors factory), government incentives during my tenure resulted in the reopening of a refinery, the near doubling of employment in the state by one of the world\xe2\x80\x99s largest banks and keeping two of the three spinoffs from the Dow/Dupont merger in Delaware.'
p17477
aS'I don\xe2\x80\x99t regret making those investments to keep jobs from going to other states.'
p17478
aS'But it would be better for taxpayers if these kinds of cash incentives could be invested instead in such things as schools and infrastructure.'
p17479
aS'I don\xe2\x80\x99t blame companies like Amazon for playing the incentives game.'
p17480
aS'They have a responsibility to do their best by their shareholders and workers in a climate where competitors are benefiting from similar payouts.'
p17481
aS'Interestingly, though, the chief executives I worked with as governor were less interested in short-term incentives and more focused on long-term partnerships that would help ensure their success.'
p17482
aS'They viewed these incentives as evidence that state and local officials were committed to their company\xe2\x80\x99s future.'
p17483
aS'And I don\xe2\x80\x99t blame public officials, either, for their efforts to attract businesses with enticements, since they otherwise would risk losing out on new jobs, the transfer of old ones elsewhere and the bad publicity that could come with abandoning efforts to entice or retain companies.'
p17484
aS'That would be the equivalent of competing with other cities and states with one arm tied behind your back, and like other leaders, I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t going to do that as governor.'
p17485
aS'The result is a market failure in which neither side is motivated to fix the problem.'
p17486
aS'State and local policy makers can\xe2\x80\x99t unilaterally opt out without potentially negative consequences for their constituents, while businesses have a fiduciary obligation to pursue these short-term direct incentives.'
p17487
aS'Competition for jobs should not be seen to hinge on which government can write the biggest check to an employer but on the kinds of things that officials in Delaware and other states spend so much time on to make their communities places worth living in: the quality of schools, work force development programs, the transportation grid and other infrastructure, and the overall quality of life.'
p17488
aS'The solution is straightforward: Congress should institute a federal tax of 100 percent on every dollar a business receives in state or local incentives that are directed specifically to that company.'
p17489
aS'This would not include investments in public infrastructure, work force development or other investments that can attract employers while also providing a significant long-term benefit to taxpayers.'
p17490
aS'This tax would, however, end payouts that go directly to a company\xe2\x80\x99s bottom line and would eliminate the pressure these companies are under to pursue such enticements.'
p17491
aS'I\xe2\x80\x99m talking about incentives like direct grants to a company in exchange for the creation of a specific number of jobs (something we did in Delaware while I was governor) or free or reduced land or the passage of a tax policy tailored specifically to one company.'
p17492
aS'States would still compete for these jobs \xe2\x80\x94 but they would do so in a way that better aligns with the long-term interests of taxpayers and the businesses themselves.'
p17493
aS'States and municipalities would also retain the ability to institute tax-friendly policies for certain sectors \xe2\x80\x94 like small businesses or high-tech firms (Delaware, for example, has instituted one of the most attractive research and development tax credits in the country).'
p17494
aS'This approach would provide a significant victory for taxpayers.'
p17495
aS'Instead of making direct payments to businesses, states and municipalities would invest in and compete solely based on factors that make the most difference for an area\xe2\x80\x99s economic potential and for a company\xe2\x80\x99s ultimate success, like the abilities of the work force, the excellence of their schools and the quality of life for residents.'
p17496
aS'That is a competition worth having.'
p17497
aS'Because of lax security at Equifax, one of the three major credit reporting companies, the private financial and personal details of as many as 143 million Americans have been exposed to hackers.'

p17519
aS'That changed with the Fair Credit Reporting Act, which was signed in 1970.'

p17526
aS'That means that a report that workers have no control over and frequently don\xe2\x80\x99t even get a chance to see, which can have at least one error, is helping determine whether or not they get a job.'
p17527
aS'There\xe2\x80\x99s no good reason for employers to use this information \xe2\x80\x94 credit reports haven\xe2\x80\x99t been shown to predict employee performance.'

p17553
aS'It means using the diplomatic channel we opened with Iran, after 35 years without such contact, to avoid inadvertent escalation.'

aS'And when Mr. Trump suggests abandoning this "bad" deal because the only "good" deal is one that magically covers all of Iran\xe2\x80\x99s regional activities, it only becomes harder to mobilize international pressure against Iran\xe2\x80\x99s Revolutionary Guard and its proxies like Hezbollah.'
