S' Residents were allowed to return Tuesday to some islands in the hurricane-slammed Florida Keys as officials tried to piece together the scope of Irma\'s destruction and rushed aid into the drenched and debris-strewn state.\nTwo days after the storm roared into the Keys with 130 mph winds, the full extent of the destruction there was still a question mark because communications and access were cut off in many cases.\nBut residents and business owners from Key Largo, Tavernier and Islamorada near the mainland were allowed back for their first look.\nThe Lower Keys \xe2\x80\x94 including the chain\'s most distant and most populous island, Key West, with 27,000 people \xe2\x80\x94 were still off-limits, with a roadblock in place where the single highway to the farther islands was washed out. Road repairs were promised in the coming days.\nCorey Smith, a UPS driver who rode out the hurricane in Key Largo, said Tuesday that power was out on the island, there was very limited gas and supermarkets were closed. Branches and other brush blocked some roads.\n"They\'re shoving people back to a place with no resources," he said by telephone. "It\'s just going to get crazy pretty quick."\nStill, he said people coming back to Key Largo should be relieved that many buildings escaped major damage.\nOn Tuesday morning, the rainy remnants of Irma pushed through Alabama and Mississippi after drenching Georgia. Flash-flood watches and warnings were issued around the Southeast.\nSeven deaths in Florida have been blamed on Irma, along with two in Georgia and one in South Carolina. At least 35 people were killed in the Caribbean.\nAn estimated 13 million Florida residents were without electricity \xe2\x80\x94 two-thirds of the state\'s population \xe2\x80\x94 as sweltering heat returned across the peninsula in the storm\'s wake.\nMore than 180,000 people huddled in shelters in Florida, and officials warned it could take weeks for electricity to be restored to everyone.\n"I know for our entire state, especially the Keys, it\'s going to be a long road," Gov. Rick Scott said.\nOff Florida\'s southern tip, authorities were stopping people to check documentation such as proof of residency or business ownership before allowing them back into the Upper Keys. All three hospitals on the island chain were still closed.\nAfter flying over the Keys on Monday, the governor described overturned mobile homes, washed-ashore boats and other damage. A Navy aircraft carrier was due to anchor off Key West to help in the search-and-rescue effort.\nKey West resident Laura Keeney waited in a Miami hotel for word that it was safe to return home, and she was anxious to hear more about her apartment complex. Her building manager told her about flooding there, but further updates were hard to come by because of limited phone service.\n"They told me there is definitely water in the downstairs apartment, which is me," said Keeney, who works as a hotel concierge.\nLower Keys resident Leyla Nedin said she doesn\'t plan to return anytime soon to her home near where Irma came ashore on Cudjoe Key.\n"There are still nine bridges that need final inspections. Plus we are still without water, power, sewer, gas and cell service," she said. "My concern is that even if we get to go in to the Lower Keys, our fragile infrastructure could be even more compromised."\nThe Keys are linked by 42 bridges that have to be checked for safety before motorists can be allowed on the farther islands, officials said. County officials said crews were working to reopen U.S. 1 as quickly as possible.\nIn a parting blow to the state, the storm caused record flooding in the Jacksonville area.\nThe Jacksonville Sheriff\'s Office said 356 people were rescued from the floodwaters on Monday. On its Twitter account, the sheriff\'s office said it hopes "people who had their lives saved yesterday will take evacuation orders seriously in the future."\nPaul Johnson and Shonda Brecheen spent Sunday night in a house they were remodeling near downtown Jacksonville after working late on the project. Jonhson woke up Monday to see boats passing by where cars normally drive.\nThey managed to push his truck through standing water to a parking lot to dry out, but he\'s worried about the swamped vehicle.\n"I\'m 32, I\'ve lived here most of my life, and I\'ve never seen anything like that," he said.\n'

aS' Giancarlo Stanton\'s smacks, Aaron Judge\'s jolts and all those dizzying long balls helped Major League Baseball move another poke closer to the inevitable.\nNearly two decades after the height of the Steroids Era, the sport is on track to break its season record for home runs on Tuesday \xe2\x80\x94 and not just top the old mark, but smash it like one of those upper-deck shots that have become commonplace in the Summer of the Slugger.\nThere were 5,663 home runs hit through Sunday, 30 shy of the record set in 2000.\nJuiced balls? Watered-down pitching? Stanton\'s renaissance? Sensational starts by Judge and Cody Bellinger?\n"I don\'t think that we are ever going to have a single explanation for exactly why we\'ve see so many," baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred said. "But players are bigger and stronger. They\'re playing a little differently, in terms of the way they swing. Pitchers throw harder. The one thing I remain comfortable with: Nothing about the baseball, according to our testing, is materially different."\nThere were 5,610 homers last year, an average of 2.31 per game, and this year\'s average of 2.53 projects to 6,143. That would be up 47 percent from 4,186 in 2014.\nIn just three years, home runs will have increased by 1,957 \xe2\x80\x94 an extra 149 miles of long balls at this year\'s average home run length of 400 feet, or 15 miles more than the driving distance between Philadelphia\'s Citizen\'s Bank Park and Washington\'s Nationals Park.\n"The game has changed," New York Yankees manager Joe Girardi said. "From when I started, there\'s a lot less stolen bases, there\'s a lot less bunting, there\'s a lot less hitting-and-running. You don\'t give outs away, and you let guys swing the bat."\nAlready 107 players have hit 20 homers this year, just three shy of the record set last season \xe2\x80\x94 and up from 64 in 2015, according to the Elias Sports Bureau.\n"The ball seems to soar from people that are hitting it farther than maybe they did a year ago ... and they kind of look like the same person," Minnesota manager Paul Molitor, a Hall of Famer hitter, said before Monday night\'s game at Yankee Stadium.\nAlong with sailing shots come strikeouts, which will set a record for the 10th consecutive year. There were 36,964 whiffs through Sunday, an average of 8.25 per team per game that translates to 40,099.\n"The focus is hitting homers and tolerating strikeouts," Reggie Jackson said. "I don\'t really like all the strikeouts, and I was the king."\nBaseball officials are worried about decreasing action and have been alarmed by the strikeout rise. This year\'s total is up from 38,982 last year and an increase of nearly 8,000 from the 32,189 in 2007. The strikeout spike coincides with a rise in fastball velocity; four-seamers have averaged 93.2 mph this year, up from 91.9 mph in 2008, according to MLB data.\n"These bullpens are making it extremely difficult. From basically the starter on you\'re going to have elite, hard-throwing guys that are looking to strike you out every single time," said Baltimore\'s Mark Trumbo, last year\'s home run champion. "The game right now is as max effort as I\'ve seen it. Guys are throwing harder. At the plate sometimes you have no choice. It\'s hard to steer the ball around when it\'s 98 miles an hour and up in the zone."\nJackson set a record with 2,597 career strikeouts, maxing at 171 in 1968. Six players already have reached 171 this year, led by the Yankees\' Judge at 197. He could break Mark Reynolds\' season record of 223, set in 2009.\n"You\'d have been on the bench," Jackson said. "But I don\'t know if you set a guy on the bench with 90 RBIs and 40 homers. That\'s Judge. You ain\'t going to sit that on the bench."\nSteroids fueled the home run surge in the late 1990s and early 2000s, and power subsided after the start of drug testing with penalties in 2004. The home run average dropped in 2014 to its lowest level since 1992, then started rising during the second half of the 2015 season.\nMLB has the UMass-Lowell\'s Baseball Research Center conduct periodic testing of baseballs and University of Illinois physics professor emeritus Alan Nathan consults as part of quality control. The sport has said repeatedly that baseballs fall within the specifications in the rules.\nManfred isn\'t worried some undetectable substance is fueling the new rise.\n"I have never said that it\'s impossible there\'s something out there that we\'re missing," he said. "What I am saying is we\'re doing more, more frequently, less predictably, with better testing, and that\'s all you can do."\n'

aS' The U.S. government received reports of three spills at one of Houston\'s dirtiest Superfund toxic waste sites in the days after the drenching rains from Hurricane Harvey finally stopped. Aerial photos reviewed by The Associated Press show dark-colored water surrounding the site as the floods receded, flowing through Vince Bayou and into the city\'s ship channel.\nThe reported spills, which have been not publicly detailed, occurred at U.S. Oil Recovery, a former petroleum industry waste processing plant contaminated with a dangerous brew of cancer-causing chemicals. On Aug. 29, the day Harvey\'s remnants cleared out, a county pollution control team sent photos to the Environmental Protection Agency of three large concrete tanks flooded with water. That led PRP Group, the company overseeing the ongoing cleanup, to call a federal emergency hotline to report a spill affecting nearby Vince Bayou.\nOver the next several days, the company reported two more spills of potentially contaminated storm water from U.S. Oil Recovery, according to reports and call logs obtained by the AP from the U.S. Coast Guard, which operates the National Response Center hotline. The EPA requires that spills of oil or hazardous substances in quantities that may be harmful to public health or the environment be immediately reported to the 24-hour hotline when public waterways are threatened.\nThe EPA has not publicly acknowledged the three spills that PRP Group reported to the Coast Guard. The agency said an on-scene coordinator was at the site last Wednesday and found no evidence that material had washed off the site. The EPA says it is still assessing the scene.\nThe AP reported in the days after Harvey that at least seven Superfund sites in and around Houston were underwater during the record-shattering storm. Journalists surveyed the sites by boat, vehicle and on foot. U.S. Oil Recovery was not one of the sites visited by AP. EPA said at the time that its personnel had been unable to reach the sites, though they surveyed the locations using aerial photos.\nFollowing AP\'s report, EPA has been highlighting the federal agency\'s response to the flooding at Superfund sites. EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt reiterated that safeguarding the intensely-polluted sites is among his top priorities during a visit Friday to the San Jacinto River Waste Pits, one of the sites AP reported about two weeks ago.\nPruitt then boarded a Coast Guard aircraft for an aerial tour of other nearby Superfund sites flooded by Harvey, including U.S. Oil Recovery.\nPhotos taken Aug. 31 by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration shows dark-colored water surrounding the site two days after the first spill was reported to the government hotline.  While the photos do not prove contaminated materials leaked from U.S. Oil Recovery, they do show that as the murky floodwaters receded, they flowed through Vince Bayou and emptied into the ship channel leading to the San Jacinto River. The hotline caller identified Vince Bayou as the waterway affected by a spill of unknown material in unknown amounts.\nThomas Voltaggio, a retired EPA official who oversaw Superfund cleanups and emergency responses for more than two decades, reviewed the aerial photos, hotline reports and other documents obtained by AP.\n"It is intuitively obvious that the rains and floods of the magnitude that occurred during Hurricane Harvey would have resulted in some level of contamination having been released to the environment," said Voltaggio, who is now a private consultant. "Any contamination in those tanks would likely have entered Vince Bayou and potentially the Houston Ship Channel."\nHe said the amount of contaminants spread from the site during the storm will likely never be known, making the environmental impact difficult to measure. The Houston Ship Channel was already a polluted waterway, with Texas state health officials warning that women of childbearing age and children should not eat fish or crabs caught there because of contamination from dioxins and PCBs.\nPRP Group, the corporation formed to oversee the cleanup at U.S. Oil Recovery, said it reported the spills as legally required but said subsequent testing of storm water remaining in the affected tanks showed it met federal drinking water standards. The company declined to provide AP copies of those lab reports or a list of specific chemicals for which it tested, saying the EPA was expected to release that information soon.\nU.S. Oil Recovery was shut down in 2010 after regulators determined operations there posed an environmental threat to Vince Bayou, which flows through the property in Pasadena. Pollution at the former hazardous waste treatment plant is so bad that Texas prosecutors charged the company\'s owner, Klaus Genssler, with five criminal felonies. The German native fled the United States and is considered a fugitive. Genssler did not respond to efforts to contact him last week through his social media accounts or an email account linked to his website address.\nMore than 100 companies that sent hazardous materials and oily waste to U.S. Oil Recovery for processing are now paying for the multimillion-dollar cleanup there through a court-monitored settlement, including Baker Hughes Oilfield Operations Inc., U.S. Steel Corp. and Dow Chemical Co.\nPast sampling of materials at the site revealed high concentrations of hazardous chemicals linked to cancer, such as benzene, ethylbenzene and trichloroethylene. The site also potentially contains toxic heavy metals, including mercury and arsenic.\nA 2012 EPA study of the more than 500 Superfund sites across the United States located in flood zones specifically noted the risk that floodwaters might carry away and spread toxic materials over a wider area.\nOver the past six years, remediation efforts at U.S. Oil Recovery have focused on the northern half of the site, including demolishing contaminated structures, removing an estimated 500 tons of sludge and hauling away more than 1,000 abandoned containers of waste.\nPRP Group said the southern portion of the site, including the three waste tanks that flooded during Harvey, has not yet been fully cleaned. Over the years workers have removed more than 1.5 million gallons of liquid waste \xe2\x80\x94 enough to fill nearly three Olympic-sized swimming pools.\nAP began asking the EPA whether contaminated material might have again leaked from U.S. Oil Recovery last week, after reviewing the aerial photos taken Aug. 31. The EPA said it visited the site on Sept. 4, nearly a week after site operators reported an initial spill, and again the following week. The EPA said that its staff saw no evidence that toxins had washed away from the scene during either visit.\n"Yesterday, an EPA On-scene coordinator conducted an inspection of Vince Bayou to follow up on a rumor that material was offsite and did not find any evidence of a black oily discharge or material from the U.S. Oil Recovery site," an EPA media release said on Thursday.\nPRP Group said the spills occurred at the toxic waste site on Aug. 29, Sept. 6 and Sept. 7. One of the EPA\'s media releases on Sept. 9, more than 11 days after the first call was made to the hotline, made reference to overflowing water at the scene, but did not describe it as a spill.\nThe company said it reported the first spill after Harvey\'s floodwaters swamped the three tanks, filling them. The resulting pressure that built up in the tanks dislodged plugs blocking a series of interconnecting pipes, causing the second and third spills reported to the hotline the following week.\nThe company does not know how much material leaked from the tanks, soaking into the soil or flowing into nearby Vince Bayou. As part of its post-storm cleanup workers have vacuumed 63 truckloads holding about 315,000 gallons from the tanks.\nThe Superfund site is located just a few hundred yards from the Pollution Control Services offices for Harris County, which includes Houston. Its director, Bob Allen, says his team took pictures of the flooding on Aug. 29, when the area that includes the three big tanks was still underwater. The AP requested those photos as public records, but they have not yet been released.\nAllen said his staff did not note any black water or oily sheen on the surface at the time, and did not collect water samples for testing. He said the EPA later sampled the area to determine whether there was contamination.\n"We knew that the water probably got into the plant, probably washed out some of the stuff that was in the clarifier," Allen said, referring to one of the old concrete tanks once used to store toxic waste. "Once they get done with the assessment of that site and the other Superfund Harris County sites, then they\'ll probably let us know, let the public know, what\'s been going on.\n'

aS' A summer of natural catastrophes, from epic hurricanes to scorching wildfires, has exposed another peril in disaster-prone states: How to pay for the rescues, repairs and rebuilding.\nThe combined tab from Hurricanes Harvey and Irma is expected to hit $200 billion or more. While the federal government is expected to pay most of that, the affected state and local governments have to start paying for recovery now and eventually could be on the hook for tens of millions of dollars or more.\nStates vary on how prepared they are to weather such costs. Florida and South Carolina, both hit by Hurricane Irma, are among the dozen or so states that do not have dedicated disaster funds and opt to cover the expenses after the fact, potentially by dipping into reserves or shifting money from other state agencies.\nExperts say such pay-as-you-go disaster funding can be risky. Add an economic downturn when reserves are low and budgets are tight, and state and local officials could easily find themselves struggling to pay for recovery and rebuilding.\nEven putting money into a dedicated disaster fund may not be enough.\nIn Montana, where wildfires raged across the state this summer, threatening hundreds of homes and destroying a historic lodge in Glacier National Park, the firefighting costs so far have exceeded the amount set aside in a special disaster fund by $20 million.\n"It took us all by surprise," state Rep. Nancy Ballance said.\nAll but a handful of states maintain so-called rainy day accounts, but in most cases "rainy day" is a misnomer: The money is typically used to get through economic downturns rather than responding to natural disasters. States tapped, and in many cases depleted, their rainy day funds to avoid massive cuts and maintain critical services after tax revenue plummeted during the recession.\nSeveral states have struggled to rebuild their savings since then because tax revenue hasn\'t rebounded enough to provide a cushion. In all, 33 states reported tax revenue coming in below forecast last year.\nNew Jersey\'s rainy day fund has been empty since 2009. Pennsylvania\'s is so small it would barely fund government operations for two hours, according to a recent study by the Pew Charitable Trusts.\nTexas, hit hard by Hurricane Harvey last month, has the largest rainy day fund of any state \xe2\x80\x94 $10 billion \xe2\x80\x94 but state officials are keeping that as a last resort. Gov. Greg Abbott has said he wants to consider what other funding might be available first. That could include tapping into money already allocated to state agencies.\nOthers in Texas, including Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, have advocated for tapping into reserves now.\n"If this isn\'t a rainy day, I don\'t know what is," Patrick said last week.\nGeorgia is one of the states better prepared financially to handle the unexpected costs of a disaster. It has a dedicated emergency fund with roughly $20 million available annually and a rainy day fund with approximately $2.4 billion, England said.\n"Thankfully, our economy is in pretty good shape right now," said state Rep. Terry England, chairman of the House budget committee in Georgia, where all 159 counties reported damage from Hurricane Irma. "If this had hit in 2010 or 2011, it might have been a little bit different."\nIn addition to budget reserves, 28 states have established special funds to help residents and businesses after a disaster. The downside: Several are not currently funded, according to the National Emergency Management Association.\nCalifornia is among the states with a dedicated disaster fund \xe2\x80\x94 for fighting wildfires \xe2\x80\x94 but already has burned through more than half the $427 million it set aside this year, with Southern California\'s fearsome Santa Ana wind season looming. Even if that fund runs dry, however, the state will tap other sources, said H.D. Palmer, spokesman for the state Department of Finance.\n"There has never been a situation when the state\'s finances would be an impediment to deploying crews and materials to knock down a fire as soon as possible to save lives and property," he said.\nMontana\'s wildfire season has left lawmakers there facing difficult decisions.\nThe state typically keeps between $50 million and $100 million on hand for wildfire costs. This year, after a relatively wet winter and facing an estimate of lower than expected tax revenue, lawmakers authorized the governor to use some of that money to help fill a budget gap \xe2\x80\x94 leaving about $30 million in the fund.\nThen disaster struck in the form of several large wildfires, which the state estimates have burned about 10 times as much land as last year\'s fires. So far, the state has spent roughly $58 million on fire suppression since the beginning of July.\n"We thought we would be OK with fires," said Ballance, chairwoman of the House budget committee, "so we took the money to use in other ways."\nWith tax revenue down, the state has depleted its reserves and emergency funds. The governor has asked state agencies to prepare for 10 percent cuts to fill a projected $227 million budget shortfall.\nWhile the federal government spends tens of billions to help communities recover, the assistance is not guaranteed and the amounts generally cover only a share of the recovery costs \xe2\x80\x94 up to 75 percent.\nThe federal share also might be changing.\nPresident Donald Trump\'s budget proposal calls for cutting billions of dollars from agencies involved in disaster management. At the Federal Emergency Management Agency, Trump has proposed cutting the disaster relief budget by $667 million, targeting grants that help state and local governments prepare for natural disasters.\nIn addition, FEMA is considering a change to how it reimburses states for disaster costs. It would require them to pay a predetermined amount before the federal government would provide money to repair or replace damaged infrastructure.\nThe main challenge, experts say, is for state and local officials to set aside money ahead of time.\n"It\'s very difficult for elected officials to pay attention to disaster funding when the sun is shining and the sky is blue," said Trina Sheets, executive director of the National Emergency Management Association.\n'

aS' The Latest on Irma (all times local):\n10:48 a.m.\nFlorida\'s governor says that bridges linking the Florida Keys appeared to escape serious damage from Hurricane Irma, but more time is needed to finish inspections.\nGov. Rick Scott said Tuesday that officials continue to check the 42 Overseas Highway bridges that link the Florida Keys together. He said none appear seriously damaged but that "we\'re not sure that on the bridges we should be putting on significant weight."\nResidents were allowed to return Tuesday to some islands in the Upper Keys. But there was a roadblock preventing people from accessing islands further away while repairs and inspections continue.\n__\n10:25 a.m.\nNASA\'s Kennedy Space Center in Florida remains closed, but appears to have weathered Hurricane Irma well.\nThe same holds true at adjoining Cape Canaveral Air Force Station.\nInspection crews were out in full force Tuesday.\nPower has been restored to NASA and Air Force facilities but water service is out. Until that\'s restored, Kennedy will stay closed to non-essential personnel.\nOver at Kennedy\'s tourist area, life-size replicas of the space shuttle fuel tank and booster rockets were still standing outside the home of shuttle Atlantis. No major damage has been reported at the visitor complex.\nBrigadier General Wayne Monteith, who\'s in charge of Air Force operations says, "We dodged another bullet." Last October, Hurricane Matthew stayed safely off shore. On Monday, Irma remained well to the west of Cape Canaveral.\n'

aS' France\'s president and the Dutch king visited Caribbean territories on Tuesday that have been hammered by Hurricane Irma, trying to quell accusations by residents that European governments were unprepared, slow to react and sometimes even racist in their responses to the devastation.\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron flew into Guadeloupe and was heading to the hard-hit French-Dutch island of St. Martin to meet with residents.  His plane brought water, food, tons of medicine and emergency equipment, doctors and recovery experts to an island demolished by the power of the Category 5 hurricane.\nIn a news conference in the Pointe-a-Pitre airport, Macron said the government\'s "top priority" is to help island residents return to normal life.\n"We have put in place one of the biggest air bridges since World War II" to bring emergency aid and rescuers to the islands of St. Martin and St. Barts, he said.\nMacron said 11 people were killed in the French side of St. Martin, up from a previous death toll of 10. The government did not release details about the victims. The Dutch prime minister says four people were killed on the Dutch side of the island.\nAbout 1,900 French police and troops are now on the ground to ensure security in St. Martin and power has been restored in about 50 percent of its homes, the French president said.\nResidents on the island have spoken of hunger, homelessness, a lack of water and a feeling of abandonment after the hurricane pummeled the region on Wednesday. Some felt the French government spend more efforts rescuing white tourists than black or mixed-race islanders.\nFrench authorities said they gave priority to injured, sick and elderly people.\nMacron said 2,000 people have already been evacuated from St. Martin\'s French territory and new flights are going to be organized by the end of the week.\nIrma left entire islands and tens of thousands of people in the Caribbean without water or electricity and reduced many homes to splinters.  The French, British and Dutch governments sent warships, planes and security forces to keep order and deliver aid but some of that aid was slowed down further by Hurricane Jose, which passed north of the region over the weekend.\nA medical center was being set up Tuesday in the stadium of Marigot, a port on St. Martin, and a French military ship will provide additional medical facilities in coming days, French Prime Minister Edouard Philippe said.\nDutch King Willem-Alexander arrived on St. Martin on Monday and said the scenes of devastation were the worst he has ever seen. The island is shared between a French territory and the former Dutch colony of St. Maarten, a largely autonomous part of the Dutch kingdom with a population of around 40,000.\n"I\'ve never experienced anything like this before and I\'ve seen a lot of natural disasters in my life. I\'ve seen a lot of war zones in my life. but I\'ve never seen anything like this," Willem-Alexander said on the Dutch national network NOS.\nWillem-Alexander said he was encouraged to see residents already working together to rebuild the shattered capital of Philipsburg.\n"It\'s been very useful to see for myself what terrible damage this storm has done and in this way to also show the population of St. Martin and the governor and prime minister that we stand together here as a kingdom and that we will solve this together," he told reporters.\nWillem-Alexander was flying Tuesday to the nearby Dutch islands of Saba and St. Eustatius, which also were hit by Irma but suffered less damage than St. Martin.\nMeanwhile, British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson will be visiting the British Virgin Islands and Anguilla to see the relief effort firsthand. He was expected to reach Barbados on Tuesday.\nJohnson has defended the British government\'s response amid claims it was slow to help the British overseas territories, saying there had been an "unprecedented" effort to deal with the aftermath of the storm. At least five people died in the British territories.\nDutch Foreign Minister Bert Koenders said he believes the European Union should send relief funds to both the French and the Dutch sides of St. Martin, and said he would also appeal to the United Nations to help the islands.\n"Everybody should benefit from that money," he told reporters after a Cabinet meeting called to discuss the fallout from Irma.\n'

aS' Veteran Republicans are bailing on Congress in growing numbers, as GOP control of Washington fails to produce the unity or legislative successes party leaders wish for. With President Donald Trump willing, if not eager, to buck fellow Republicans and even directly attack them, a number of lawmakers no longer wish to be involved.\nThe latest was two-term Rep. Dave Trott of Michigan, who said in a statement Monday that he\'d decided after careful consideration that the best course for him was to spend more time with his family and return to the private sector.\nIn contrast to those diplomatic words was Trott\'s most recent tweet, sent in mid-August: "I think America needs more unity and less divisiveness...meaning @realDonaldTrump should focus more on golf & have less press conferences."\nTrott joins a string of moderate Republicans, including Reps. Charlie Dent of Pennsylvania, Dave Reichert of Washington state and Ileana Ros-Lehtinen of Florida, who are not seeking re-election.\nEach of these seats will be heavily contested by Democrats eager to take back control of the House, and rumors abound of other GOP retirements still to come. Michigan Republican, Rep. Fred Upton, is mulling a campaign for U.S. Senate, according to party operatives who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss private deliberations.\nAlso Monday a senior GOP senator, Bob Corker of Tennessee, issued a statement indicating indecision about his future following a CNN report stating that the influential chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee had not yet decided whether to seek re-election next year.\n"It\'s not an automatic for me. It just isn\'t," Corker told reporters, although he added that as chairman he has "a lot of impact without passing legislation. I can influence things. This is more about just what I believe to be the right thing to do."\nAlthough Republicans are hopeful Corker ultimately will decide to run \xe2\x80\x94 he already has $7.5 million in his campaign account \xe2\x80\x94 the senator was in Trump\'s Twitter cross-hairs in August after criticizing the president\'s response to the racially motivated protests in Charlottesville.\n"Tennessee not happy!" the president declared after claiming that Corker was "constantly" asking him whether or not he should run again next year.\nThe developments have alarmed GOP operatives concerned that the trickle of retirements could turn into a flood unless congressional Republicans and Trump can come together and produce on their promises, particularly by overhauling the tax code. And, with Trump bypassing Republicans to make deals with Democrats, and encouraging primary challenges against sitting GOP senators, the retirement decisions also reflect concerns among some about whether they will get party support when they need it, especially with former Trump adviser Steve Bannon threatening all-out war on congressional leadership.\n"There are some stability concerns in the party about whose team everyone is on," said Josh Holmes, a GOP consultant and former chief of staff to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky. "Concerns about whether your party is really with you."\nIt all illustrates that, far from producing unity within the Republican Party, the Trump era appears to be exacerbating existing GOP divisions while creating new ones. The familiar divide between pragmatic and ideologically driven Republicans has been heightened, while Trump\'s deal-making with top Democrats last week is forcing elected Republicans to choose sides between Trump and GOP leaders McConnell and House Speaker Paul Ryan.\n"The party never united around Trump as it would another nominee, let alone president, and Trump is not a limited government conservative," said Alex Conant, a former top aide to Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla. "And so he is not a traditional Republican and as a result is going to clash with the traditional Republicans that fill the ranks of Congress."\nThe chaos and uncertainty produced by Trump and his orbit would be more acceptable to congressional Republicans if the party was achieving legislative success. Instead, its long-standing promise to repeal and replace Barack Obama\'s health care law collapsed on the Senate floor in July, while other priorities are moving slowly. As a result, a number of Republicans on and off Capitol Hill have come to view tax reform of some kind as a must-pass priority, without which the dam would likely break on retirements and Republicans would be in serious jeopardy of losing control of the House.\n"Republicans need to put points on the board, to deliver and show they are getting something done," said Tom Reynolds, a former New York congressman who once chaired the National Republican Congressional Committee and is now a lobbyist.\nYet despite enthusiasm among Republicans, any final tax plan is a long way off, and many analysts are already predicting that Republicans will end up settling for some tax cuts that add to the deficit rather than full-blown reform.\nFor their part, Democrats are projecting increased confidence about their prospects in next year\'s midterms, especially in the House, where they must gain 24 seats to win the majority. Republicans have a 240-194 edge, with one vacancy. Democrats have their highest hopes pinned on the 23 districts where GOP House candidates won last year, as did Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton.\nHouse Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi pointed to Trump\'s overall approval rating nationally, which has dipped below 40 percent.\n"There\'s probably nothing more dispositive of who wins next year\'s elections than where the president stands a year before," Pelosi, D-Calif., told reporters Friday. "The year is fraught with meaning because that\'s when people decide whether to run or not, and that really is a timetable that\'s very important to us, and very positive for us right now."\n'

aS' Pushing toward the Republicans\' prime goal of tax legislation, the GOP Senate leader and members of the Budget Committee are scrambling to come up with a budget deal to clear the way for the first tax overhaul in three decades.\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and GOP members of the Budget Committee are meeting Tuesday with two top Trump administration officials to plot breaking the budget stalemate.\nLack of a budget plan for the 2018 fiscal year starting Oct. 1 is a roadblock to the must-do legislation overhauling the tax system that Republicans and President Donald Trump have made their highest priority. Trump\'s top economic adviser, Gary Cohn, and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin are meeting with McConnell and budget panel members.\nUnderscoring the president\'s desire for tax legislation, Trump was hosting a bipartisan group of senators for dinner at the White House on Tuesday, including a trio of moderate Democrats from states Trump won last November and whose votes he\'d like to have on a tax bill.\nDemocratic Sens. Joe Manchin of West Virginia, Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota and Joe Donnelly of Indiana are to be joined at dinner by Republican Sens. John Thune of North Dakota, Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania and Orrin Hatch of Utah, the White House said.\nManchin, Heitkamp and Donnelly are the only Democratic senators who did not sign a letter addressed to Republican leaders and Trump that said the Democratic caucus would not support a tax overhaul that cuts taxes for the "top 1 percent" or adds to the government\'s $20 trillion debt.\nHeitkamp traveled with Trump aboard Air Force One to an event in her home state last week where he spoke broadly about the tax plan. Trump pitched the senator on the overhaul, calling her a "good woman." Heitkamp said after the event that she needs to see the details first.\nUnder Washington\'s complicated ways, passing a congressional budget blueprint is the only way to set in motion a special process for rewriting the tax code. If Congress can pass a budget, Republicans controlling the Senate don\'t need to worry about a Democratic filibuster blocking any tax bill.\nHouse action has been held up by a battle between moderates and conservatives over whether to pair spending cuts with the filibuster-proof tax measure. Senate action has been on hold while the House struggles.\nAn impasse could doom the tax overhaul effort.\nOn the budget panel, Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tenn., is hoping to limit the deficit cost of the tax effort, while Toomey is on the other end of the spectrum favoring more robust deficit-financed tax cuts. GOP leaders have asked them to try to craft an agreement among the 12 budget panel Republicans. Any Republican defection on the budget plan would deadlock the narrowly divided committee.\n"I\'m a fiscal hawk, OK? I believe in pro-growth tax reform and I believe that\'s a mechanism toward lowering deficits," Corker said Monday. "But I\'m also someone who wants to be realistic about all of this, and not let this just be party time that takes us no place but massive deficits down the road."\nRevamping the nation\'s tax system and providing relief for the middle class is a Republican mission following the collapse of efforts to repeal and replace former President Barack Obama\'s health care law. Trump has made it a pillar of his push for economic growth.\n'

aS' They arrived at a fairground in a deep corner of Appalachia before daybreak, hundreds of people with throbbing teeth, failing eyes, wheezing lungs. They took a number, sat in the bleachers and waited in the summer heat for their name to be called so they could receive the medical help they can\'t get anywhere else.\nAmong the visitors at the free, once-a-year medical clinic was Lisa Kantsos, whose first stop was the dental tent, a sprawl of tables and chairs where volunteer dentists and students performed cleanings, filled cavities and pulled teeth. After getting a cleaning, she made a stop at a mammography van. Last year, it was free glasses.\n"It\'s a blessing. It really is," said Kantsos, a 52-year-old diabetic, "because I don\'t have to worry about these things."\nKantsos and many of the estimated 2,000 others who turned out at the Wise County Fairgrounds in late July are the health care debate\'s forgotten.\nEven with the passage of "Obamacare" in 2010, they have no insurance because they exist in a desperate in-between zone, unable to afford coverage but ineligible for Medicaid. And because they haven\'t benefited from the Affordable Care Act, the debate on Capitol Hill over repealing it has been all but irrelevant to them.\n"Whether there was an Affordable Care Act or not, it really hasn\'t made any difference for these people," said Stan Brock, who founded the free traveling Remote Area Medical Clinic in the 1980s.\nThe need for better, more affordable care around here is undeniable.\nThe central Appalachian area that includes eastern Kentucky, southern West Virginia and western Virginia has long been one of the sickest and poorest regions in the country. More recently, it has been ravaged by the decline of coal mining.\n"Everything revolved around coal," said Matt Sutherland, a frequent visitor to the clinic from Castlewood, Virginia. "Now there\'s not a lot of work, not a lot for people to do."\nPeople in central Appalachia are 41 percent more likely to get diabetes and 42 percent more likely to die of heart disease than the rest of the nation, according to a study released in August by the Appalachian Regional Commission and other groups. The study also found that the region\'s supply of specialty doctors per 100,000 people is 65 percent lower than in the rest of the nation.\nAnd people from southwestern Virginia die on average 10 years sooner than those from wealthier counties close to Washington, said August Wallmeyer, an author who lobbies the Virginia legislature on health issues.\nOpioids are also taking their toll in Appalachia. In Virginia in 2014, drug overdoses became the No. 1 cause of accidental death, according to Wallmeyer\'s 2016 book, "The Extremes of Virginia."\nBut Virginia was among 19 states that chose not to expand Medicaid as part of the Affordable Care Act. Many states cited the cost, even though Washington pledged to pick up nearly the entire expense. An expansion in Virginia would have covered an additional 400,000 people.\n"A lot of people, when the Affordable Care Act was first enacted and went into effect, had the mistaken belief that it was going to help the very poor people, particularly in Appalachia and other parts of Virginia," Wallmeyer said. "And it\'s just not true."\nWallmeyer said the clinic in Wise County doesn\'t see as many patients as it once did from Kentucky, a state that expanded Medicaid under the ACA.\nTeresa Gardner Tyson, executive director of Virginia\'s Health Wagon, a free clinic that takes part in the Wise event, lamented that the politicians "forget at the end of the day that they\'re our servants."\n"They can\'t get away from the partisan politics, but here we\'re faced with people dying on a daily basis," she said.\nAmong the patients at the free clinic was Joey Johnson, who shot himself in the head while playing with a gun when he was a teenager and has been in a wheelchair for 25 years.\nNo longer receiving health benefits from his stepfather\'s union miner\'s insurance, he came to the clinic to get a dental filling and have his eyes checked. His Medicaid doesn\'t pay for dental check-ups, and he gets just $735 a month in federal disability payments and $20 in food stamps.\n"If it wasn\'t for this (clinic), my teeth would rot out of my head and I would be in bad shape," he said before his checkup, sitting shirtless in the heat. Johnson\'s assessment of lawmakers\' work on health care is more succinct than any tweet: "They don\'t care about us."\nKantsos voted for Donald Trump last fall in the hope that he could shake up Washington. She said the president needs to concentrate more on his job and less on Twitter.\nSutherland supported Trump, too, and said he thinks the president deserves more time. But Sutherland, who comes to the clinic for dental work and medicine, wishes lawmakers understood how hard life can be in Appalachia. Last year, he said, he walked 30 miles (50 kilometers) to the Wise clinic because he had no car; it took more than seven hours. Others have it bad, too.\n"I\'m not the only one," he said, sitting in a tent where people were getting teeth pulled a few feet away. "I\'m really not the only one."\n'

aS' A 60-year-old man who pleaded guilty in the killing of two young sisters from Maryland was sentenced Tuesday to 48 years in prison, more than four decades after the girls vanished during a trip to a local shopping mall.\nLloyd Lee Welch Jr. entered his plea in a Virginia court Tuesday and was sentenced soon after to two 48-year terms to run concurrently. The first-degree felony murder charges had carried the possibility of a death sentence. Welch, who is already serving a long prison term in Delaware for sexually molesting a 10-year-old girl, also received a 12-year sentence in two unrelated sexual assault cases in Prince William County in Virginia.\nWelch is accused of snatching 12-year-old Sheila Lyon and 10-year-old Katherine Lyon in March 1975. Authorities believe he burned the girls\' bodies on a remote mountain in Bedford County, Virginia, where his family owned land. They were never recovered.\nHe had been scheduled to go on trial Tuesday, but his trial request was withdrawn last week.\nThe Lyon sisters\' disappearance shattered the sense of security in Kensington, Maryland, rattling parents to the point where they no longer let their children play outside or walk to Wheaton Plaza.\n"It deeply affected everybody in a very large radius within the D.C. suburbs. People always wanted to know who did this, who was this person, what happened?" said Teresa Brookland, a former schoolmate who remembers Katherine as sweet and friendly.\nHarry Geehreng, a retired Montgomery County police sergeant who searched the mall and surrounding woods for the sisters after they disappeared, said it took a couple of days for it to sink in that the girls may have been abducted because it was a sleepy area with little crime back then.\n"It was just an innocent time and people never thought the worst," Geehreng said. "Just the idea that a total stranger absconded with these two little girls, it was really beyond belief. People were genuinely shocked."\nCold case detectives began focusing on Welch in 2013 after they noticed a composite sketch that resembled a 1977 mug shot of Welch in a burglary near Wheaton Plaza.\nWhen the girls disappeared, Welch was an 18-year-old former worker at a traveling carnival.\nA friend of the girls told police she saw a young man leering at them and following them in the mall. Based on her description, a detective drew a composite sketch of a young man with long hair and facial scars from acne.\nPolice didn\'t release the drawing to the public because they were focused on another sketch based on descriptions from witnesses who said they saw the sisters talking to an older man who had a microphone and cassette recorder. After the sketch of the older man was made public, Welch told a security guard at the mall that he seen the sisters leave with that man. Police interviewed Welch but released him because they believed he was trying to get the $9,000 reward being offered.\nIn interviews with police beginning in 2013, Welch acknowledged he was at the mall that day and said he believed they\'d been "abducted, raped and burned up," according to court documents.\nHe was charged in their deaths two years ago.\n'

aS' Senate Republicans expressed growing hope Monday for a final push to scuttle President Barack Obama\'s health care law, an effort that still faces an uphill climb and just a two-week window to pass. Adding more risk, senators would be in the dark about the bill\'s impact on Americans, since the Congressional Budget Office says crucial estimates won\'t be ready in time for a vote.\nDemocrats backed by doctors, hospitals, and patients\' groups mustered an all-out effort to finally smother the GOP drive, warning of millions losing coverage and others facing skimpier policies. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer went further, saying the partisan measure threatened the spirit of cooperation between President Donald Trump and Democratic leaders embodied in a recent budget deal and progress on immigration.\n"After two weeks of thinking bipartisanship, that flickering candle, might gain some new light, this is the last thing we need," Schumer, D-N.Y., said on the Senate floor.\nTwo months after one of the GOP\'s top priorities crashed on the Senate floor, the revived attempt to uproot Obama\'s law is being led by GOP Sens. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Louisiana\'s Bill Cassidy.\nVice President Mike Pence was calling senators to seek support, White House officials said. And looking to add momentum, House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., said the House would vote on the bill if it passes the Senate. Speaking in Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin, Ryan called it "our best, last chance to get repeal and replace done."\nThe 140-page bill would replace much of Obama\'s statute with block grants to states and give them wide leeway on spending the money. It would let states ease coverage requirements under that 2010 law, end Obama\'s mandates that most Americans buy insurance and that companies offer coverage to workers, and cut and reshape Medicaid.\nA victory would let Trump and Republican leaders claim redemption on their "repeal and replace" effort. While the House approved its version of the bill in May, the drive collapsed when the GOP-led Senate defeated three proposals for scrapping Obama\'s 2010 overhaul in July.\n"He\'s the grave robber," No. 3 Senate GOP leader John Thune of South Dakota said of Cassidy. "This thing was six feet under."\nStill, Thune cautioned that leaders needed votes from 50 of the 52 GOP senators to win.\nSenate leaders have no desire to lose yet another health care vote. After July\'s embarrassing Senate setback, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said he\'d not revisit it unless he was assured he had the votes to succeed, and many Republicans began refocusing on another big GOP priority, a tax overhaul.\nNow, Graham and Cassidy say they believe they are close to the votes they\'d need, prompting GOP leaders to check if they can finally succeed.\nThe sponsors say their proposal would let states decide what health care programs work best for their residents. Opponents say patients would suffer.\nThe GOP proposal "would weaken access to the care Americans need and deserve," said a statement from 16 patients groups including the American Heart Association and the March of Dimes. The American College of Physicians and the Children\'s Hospital Association also oppose it.\nLooking to solidify GOP support, the bill would reduce spending gaps between states that expanded Medicaid under Obama\'s law and the mostly GOP states that did not. Details on the measure\'s exact state-by-state impact were murky.\nIn a tweet, the Congressional Budget Office said it would have preliminary estimates of the bill\'s fiscal impact next week. But it said it would be unable to provide projections of the measure\'s effect on coverage, premiums and overall federal deficits "for at least several weeks."\nThat timing is crucial because Republicans controlling the Senate 52-48 have only Sept. 30 to succeed with just 50 votes. Pence would cast the tie-breaking vote, and White House officials say Trump would sign it.\nSpecial procedures preventing Democrats from using a filibuster to kill the measure expire after Sept. 30, after which Republicans would need 60 votes to win. They can\'t reach that number because Democrats unanimously oppose the GOP effort.\nThe budget agency\'s evaluations of past GOP repeal plans concluded they would have caused millions of Americans to lose insurance coverage. Some Republican senators are nervous about the measure\'s impact on their own states, and the lack of CBO projections won\'t help allay their concerns.\nConservative Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., has said he\'ll oppose the measure because it doesn\'t do enough to erase Obama\'s law. Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, said she was concerned the bill would make "fundamental changes" in Medicaid.\nOther Republicans who\'ve not yet lined up behind the bill include Alaska\'s Lisa Murkowski, Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia, John McCain of Arizona and Ohio\'s Rob Portman.\nCollins, Murkowski and McCain provided the decisive votes against the last measure Republicans tried pushing through the Senate in July, which failed 51-49.\n"It\'s better but it\'s not what the Senate is supposed to be doing," McCain told reporters about the new package.\nArizona GOP Gov. Doug Ducey said he backed the new bill, putting pressure on McCain.\nThe revived drive comes as Sens. Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn., and Patty Murray, D-Wash., work toward a bipartisan deal to continue federal subsidies to insurers easing some costs for lower-earning customers that Trump has threatened to block.\nMurray spokeswoman Helen Hare said Murray is "hopeful and optimistic" a deal could come soon, a statement that came as Democrats tried peeling away GOP support from the Graham-Cassidy bill.\n'

aS' Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke is recommending that four large national monuments in the West be reduced in size, potentially opening up hundreds of thousands of acres of land revered for natural beauty and historical significance to mining, logging and other development.\nZinke\'s recommendation, revealed in a leaked memo submitted to the White House, prompted an outcry from environmental groups who promised to take the Trump administration to court to block the moves.\nThe Interior secretary\'s plan would scale back two huge Utah monuments \xe2\x80\x94 Bears Ears and Grand Staircase-Escalante \xe2\x80\x94 along with Nevada\'s Gold Butte and Oregon\'s Cascade-Siskiyou. The monuments encompass more than 3.6 million acres \xe2\x80\x94 an area larger than Connecticut \xe2\x80\x94 and were created by Democratic administrations under a century-old law that allows presidents to protect sites considered historic, geographically or culturally important.\nZinke\'s plan also would allow logging at a newly designated monument in Maine and urges more grazing, hunting and fishing at two sites in New Mexico. It also calls for a new assessment of border-safety risks at a monument in southern New Mexico.\nBears Ears, designated for federal protection by former President Barack Obama, totals 1.3 million acres in southeastern Utah on land that is sacred to Native Americans and home to tens of thousands of archaeological sites, including ancient cliff dwellings. Grand Staircase-Escalante, in southern Utah, includes nearly 1.9 million acres in a sweeping vista larger than the state of Delaware. Republicans have howled over the monument since its creation in 1996 by former President Bill Clinton.\nCascade-Siskiyou, which juts into Northern California, protects about 113,000 acres in an area where three mountain ranges converge, while Gold Butte protects nearly 300,000 acres of desert landscapes that feature rock art, sandstone towers and wildlife habitat for bighorn sheep and the threatened Mojave Desert tortoise.\nThe Associated Press obtained a copy of the 19-page memo, which was submitted to the White House last month and has not been officially released.\nTwo marine monuments in the Pacific Ocean also would be reduced under Zinke\'s memo, and a third monument off the Massachusetts coast would be modified to allow commercial fishing. Commercial fishing also would be allowed at two Pacific sites, west of Hawaii and near American Samoa.\nPresident Donald Trump ordered a review of 27 sites earlier this year after complaining about a "massive land grab" by Obama and other former presidents.\n"It\'s gotten worse and worse and worse, and now we\'re going to free it up, which is what should have happened in the first place. This should never have happened," Trump said in ordering the review in April.\nNational monument designations add protections for lands known for their natural beauty with the goal of preserving them for future generations. The restrictions aren\'t as stringent as for national parks, but include limits on mining, timber cutting and recreational activities such as riding off-road vehicles.\nNo president has tried to eliminate a monument, but boundaries have been trimmed or redrawn 18 times, according to the National Park Service.\nZinke\'s recommendations to pare down the four Western monuments \xe2\x80\x94 and allow more economic activity at three other sites \xe2\x80\x94 "represent an unprecedented assault on our parks and public lands" by the Trump administration, said Jamie Williams, president of the Wilderness Society.\n"This callous proposal will needlessly punish local, predominantly rural communities that depend on parks and public lands for outdoor recreation, sustainable jobs and economic growth," Williams said, vowing to challenge in court any actions by the Trump administration to reduce the size of national monuments.\nIt was not clear from the memo how much energy development would be allowed on the sites recommended for changes, but Zinke said in the report that "traditional uses of the land such as grazing, timber production, mining, fishing, hunting, recreation and other cultural uses are unnecessarily restricted."\nThose restrictions especially harm rural communities in western states that have traditionally benefited from grazing, mining and logging, said Zinke, a former Montana congressman.\n"Zinke claims to follow Teddy Roosevelt, but he\'s engineering the largest rollback of public land protection in American history," said Kieran Suckling, executive director of the Center for Biological Diversity, another environmental group.\nA spokeswoman for Zinke referred questions to the White House, which said in a statement that it does not comment on leaked documents.\nIf Trump adopts the recommendations, it would quiet some of the worst fears of his opponents, who warned that vast public lands and marine areas could be lost to states or private interests.\nBut significant reductions in the size of the monuments, especially those created by Obama, would mark the latest in a string of actions where Trump has sought to erode his Democratic predecessor\'s legacy.\nThe recommendations cap an unprecedented four-month review based on Trump\'s claim that 1906 Antiquities Act has been misused by recent presidents to create oversized monuments that hinder energy development, grazing and other uses.\nBy sealing off more than 3 million acres in solidly Republican Utah, Obama and Clinton hurt local economies in rural areas that depend on logging and ranching, said Matt Anderson of the conservative Sutherland Institute.\n"It begs the question: Are these expansions more about ulterior motives like climate change, presidential legacies, corporate interests like outdoor recreation companies, or are they about antiquities?" Anderson asked.\n'

aS' The U.S. has seen no need to shoot down North Korean missiles test-fired in Japan\'s direction, but a future missile launch that threatens U.S. or Japanese territory will "elicit a different response from us," Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said Monday.\nHe also said, without elaboration, that the Trump administration has military options against North Korea that would not put Seoul at risk. He would not say whether he was referring to overt combat action, a cyberattack or something more covert.\n"I will not go into details," he said.\nMattis also confirmed that he and his South Korean counterpart had recently discussed the possibility of putting U.S. nuclear weapons back into South Korea, an option that has been raised publicly by some South Korean politicians. U.S. nuclear weapons were withdrawn from the Korean peninsula in the early 1990s at the close of the Cold War.\n"We discussed the option, but that\'s all ... I want to say," he said.\nMattis discussed several aspects of the North Korea crisis in an impromptu exchange with reporters at the Pentagon, including the effect of international economic sanctions and diplomatic pressure on North Korea. He argued that the pressure is working, and gave as an example Mexico\'s decision to expel the North Korean ambassador in Mexico City.\nHe was asked why the U.S., which has spent tens of billions of dollars on missile defense programs in recent decades, has not tried to intercept North Korea\'s rockets as they demonstrate an increasingly sophisticated missile capability.\n"No. 1, those missiles are not directly threatening any of us," he said.\nHe was referring to an accelerating series of missile tests by North Korea that have defied U.S. and international warnings to stop. North Korea has said the tests are intended to develop the capability to hit U.S. territory with a nuclear weapon. It also has threatened to launch missiles close to the coast of Guam, a U.S. island territory in the Pacific.\nOn Sept. 3, North Korea conducted an underground nuclear test that was by far its most powerful to date.\nLast week, North Korea launched an intermediate-range ballistic missile that traveled 3,700 kilometers (2,300 miles) and passed over the Japanese island of Hokkaido before landing in the northern Pacific. It was the country\'s longest-ever test flight of a ballistic missile. Mattis happened to be at U.S. Strategic Command headquarters near Omaha, Nebraska, at the time of the launch and afterward condemned it for forcing "millions of Japanese" to "duck and cover."\nIn his remarks Monday, Mattis made clear that the U.S. and Japan are prepared for future missile threats.\nThe North Koreans "are intentionally doing provocations that seem to press against the envelope for just how far can they push without going over some kind of a line, in their minds, that would make them vulnerable," he said. "So they aim for the middle of the Pacific Ocean."\n"The bottom line is that the missiles, were they to be a threat" either to the U.S. or Japan, "that would elicit a different response from us."\n'

aS' When a former police officer was acquitted in the fatal shooting of a black suspect, protesters vowed to show their disdain by disrupting business in downtown St. Louis. They quickly succeeded.\nThe unrest that followed Friday\'s ruling closed large corporate offices, shut down restaurants and bars and even forced U2 to call off a concert that would have drawn 50,000 fans into the heart of the city. And protest organizers may not be done.\nThe demonstrations engulfed the St. Louis region after a judge acquitted Jason Stockley of first-degree murder in the 2011 death of 24-year-old Anthony Lamar Smith. Within hours, downtown came to a standstill as marching protesters blocked traffic. The demonstrations went on through the weekend, with protest crowds swelling to thousands of people and spilling into a posh area of restaurants and bars in western St. Louis, the hip Delmar Loop area of nearby University City and even into two shopping malls.\nMore than 140 people were arrested.\nThe protests forced U2 to cancel a concert at the Edward Jones Dome, St. Louis\' largest venue. Police said they could not provide normal protection because of the unrest, the band and concert promoter Live Nation said in a statement.\nSinger Ed Sheeran also called off a show. The St. Louis Symphony and a Shakespearean Theatre group canceled performances too.\nDemocratic state Rep. Bruce Franks, a protest organizer, said making the entire community uncomfortable is an important part of the demonstrations. Franks said protests would continue, but he did not say when or where.\n"Folks got to pay attention, right?" Franks said Monday. "Do we just say, \'Oh, it\'s another case where an officer\'s found not guilty and leave it at that?\' No, we get out here and disrupt and make our presence felt."\nJoe Reagan, president and CEO of the St. Louis Regional Chamber of Commerce, said it\'s too early to put a dollar amount on the economic cost.\n"But in the long term, there are greater economic impacts from the racial disparity and the mistrust many have in the criminal justice system," Reagan said. "This is not new to St. Louis or unique to St. Louis, but this is a challenge."\nMany business owners are dealing with more than lost time or canceled events. Police said nearly two dozen businesses were damaged Saturday night in University City, mostly by having their windows broken. On Sunday, more windows were broken in downtown St. Louis, and several large decorative pots with plants were smashed.\nChris Rubin de la Borbolla, owner of a clothing, jewelry and accessories store in University City, said his broken window will probably cost him at least $2,000. Damage to merchandise will cost him about $2,000 more.\nJoe Edwards, owner of the Blueberry Hill restaurant and concert venue and many other Delmar Loop businesses, said he was particularly frustrated because much of the damage occurred at businesses owned by minorities.\n"Forty-five years ago, this street was in great decline and by embracing diversity we overcame it," said Edwards, who is white. "Whoever threw rocks doesn\'t care. They just want anarchy."\nBut Edwards said it was heartwarming Sunday when artists from around the region turned out to transform the plywood covering broken windows into art. Restaurants and shops were busy with people who "came in to shop and show support," he said.\nProtests resumed for the fourth straight day just after dawn Monday. A racially mixed crowd of roughly 150 people marched silently to City Hall for a rally, then to a city court building for another. Police did not intervene.\nIt was a far cry from the scene hours earlier, when a small crowd left over from an earlier peaceful protest marched into downtown late Sunday. Once they started breaking windows and throwing things at officers, police reinforcements quickly emerged and protesters scattered.\nFor the next several hours, hundreds of officers in riot gear lined downtown streets. More than 80 people were arrested, including onlookers who refused orders to disperse. Among those arrested was reporter Mike Faulk of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, according to the newspaper.\nThe cause for the escalation was not clear. Protesters blamed police for showing up in riot gear. Police said demonstrators began throwing things at them.\nOne officer suffered a leg injury and was taken to a hospital. His condition wasn\'t known.\n"I\'m proud to tell you the city of St. Louis is safe and the police owned tonight," interim Police Chief Lawrence O\'Toole said in an early morning video posted on Twitter.\nThe Sunday night unrest followed a pattern familiar since the protests in nearby Ferguson, Missouri, in 2014, following the fatal police shooting of Michael Brown. Raucous but peaceful protests dominate during the daytime and early evening, giving way to much small but more confrontational demonstrations at night.\n"The days have been calm and the nights have been destructive," Mayor Lyda Krewson said as she stood with O\'Toole on the Twitter video.\n'

aS' U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis hinted on Monday about the existence of military options on North Korea that might spare Seoul from a brutal counterattack but declined to say what kind of options he was talking about or whether they involved the use of lethal force. \nU.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley said on Sunday the U.N. Security Council had run out of options on containing North Korea\xe2\x80\x99s nuclear program and that the United States might have to turn the matter over to the Pentagon. \nAny conflict on the Korean peninsula could easily result in a degree of bloodshed unseen since the 1950-53 Korean War, which claimed the lives of more than 50,000 Americans and millions of Koreans and ended in an armed truce, not a peace treaty. \nSeoul is within artillery range of North Korea, which beyond nuclear and conventional weapons is also believed to have a sizable chemical and biological arsenal. \nAsked whether there were any military options the United States could take with North Korea that would not put Seoul at grave risk, Mattis said: \xe2\x80\x9cYes there are. But I will not go into details.\xe2\x80\x9d   \nPressed on whether that might include so-called \xe2\x80\x9ckinetic\xe2\x80\x9d options that use lethal force, Mattis said: \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t want to go into that.\xe2\x80\x9d \nMilitary options available to Trump range from non-lethal actions like a naval blockade aimed at enforcing sanctions to waging cyber attacks and positioning new U.S. weaponry in South Korea, where the United States has 28,500 troops. \nSouth Korea has raised the possibility of reintroducing nuclear weapons to the peninsula. Mattis acknowledged discussing that with his South Korean counterpart but declined to say whether that option was under consideration. \n\xe2\x80\x9cWe have open dialogue with our allies on any issue that they want to bring up,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \nU.S. President Donald Trump has hinted that any use of lethal force against North Korea would be overwhelming, using phrases like \xe2\x80\x9cfire and fury\xe2\x80\x9d that evoke images of nuclear war. \nThe U.S. military said on Monday it had staged bombing drills with South Korea, flying a pair of B-1B bombers and F-35 fighter jets over the Korean peninsula, in a show of force against North Korea. \nStill, despite heated rhetoric and posturing in the United States and North Korea, there has been no positioning of U.S. military assets to suggest a military conflict is imminent.  \nTrump has vowed that North Korea will never be allowed to threaten the United States with a nuclear-tipped missile, but he has also asked China to do more to rein in its neighbor. China in turn favors an international response to the problem. \nMattis told reporters that he believed diplomacy and sanctions were so far succeeding in putting more pressure on Pyongyang. \n\xe2\x80\x9cSo, yes, it\xe2\x80\x99s working,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \nEven as tensions rise, the United States and its allies have stuck to a hands-off policy when North Korea test-fires its missiles. Mattis confirmed that policy on Monday, saying it would not shoot down a North Korean missile unless it poses a direct threat to the United States or its allies. \nHe said Pyongyang\xe2\x80\x99s calculus appeared to be designed to race forward with its missile program, \xe2\x80\x9cwithout going over some kind of a line in their minds that would make them vulnerable.\xe2\x80\x9d \n'

aS' The U.S. consumer financial watchdog on Monday ordered National College Student Loan Trusts and its debt collector, Transworld Systems Inc, to pay at least $21.6 million for attempting to collect on possibly non-existent or out-of-date loans. \nThe Consumer Financial Protection Bureau alleged that the companies sued borrowers without being able to prove the debt was owed or pursued collection on loans that were too old to sue over, and relied on false and misleading legal documents. The CFPB said the trusts had filed at least 486 lawsuits on debt where the statute of limitations for collections had expired. \nAs a result, consumers made payments of at least $3.5 million on debt they did not owe, the CFPB said. \nThe settlements come after three years of investigation. \nA federal judge must still sign off on the penalties against National Collegiate Student Loan Trusts. According to the CFPB, the collection of 15 trusts purchased and securitized more than 800,000 private student loans, and then sold notes to investors. \nDonald Uderitz, founder of Vantage Capital Group, the beneficial owner to the trusts, said they collaborated with the CFPB on the agreement and they would work with the agency \xe2\x80\x9cto finish the job.\xe2\x80\x9d \n\xe2\x80\x9dWe frankly welcomed the intervention of the CFPB to help us to put an end to these appalling practices,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.  \nTransworld agreed to settle by paying a $2.5 million fine and taking other remediative measures only \xe2\x80\x9cin order to avoid costly and potentially protracted litigation with our primary regulator,\xe2\x80\x9d it said in a statement. \nIt did not admit or deny the investigation\xe2\x80\x99s findings, and said its business practices \xe2\x80\x9cadhere to all federal and state consumer protection laws, and embody best practices in the industry.\xe2\x80\x9d \nThe fine being paid by Transworld is part of the total of amount of at least $21.6 million. \nOffered by banks and other companies, private student loans do not provide the same borrower protections and repayment options as the federal government\xe2\x80\x99s college financing program.  \nDuring the quarter ending June 30, 11.2 percent of all outstanding student-loan debt was 90 days past due or defaulted, a greater proportion than for credit cards and mortgages, according to the New York Federal Reserve Bank. \nLast summer the CFPB, charged with guarding individuals against predatory lending, proposed toughening regulation of debt collection industry after fielding thousands of complaints from people contacted about debts they did not owe or illegally harassed by collection agencies. But it has yet to offer a new rule carrying out the proposal. \n'

aS' Rohingya Muslims fleeing a Myanmar military offensive arrived in Bangladesh on Monday with fresh accounts of violence and arson  as a rights group called for sanctions and an arms embargo to stop what the United Nations has branded ethnic cleansing. \nThe latest wave of violence in western Myanmar\xe2\x80\x99s Rakhine State began on Aug. 25, when Rohingya insurgents attacked police posts and an army camp, killing about 12 people. \nThe Myanmar military response has sent more than 410,000 Rohingya Muslims fleeing to Bangladesh, escaping what they and rights monitors say is a campaign aimed at driving out the Muslim population. \nBuddhist-majority Myanmar rejects that, saying its forces are carrying out clearance operations against the insurgents of the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army, which claimed responsibility for the August attacks and smaller raids in October. \nHundreds of refugees traveled by small boats to an island on the southernmost point of Bangladesh late on Sunday and on Monday, telling of persecution and destruction. \n\xe2\x80\x9cThe army came and they burned our homes, they killed our people. There was a mob of Rakhine people too,\xe2\x80\x9d said Usman Goni, 55, after he stepped off a boat with his seven children and wife, clutching two sticks tied in rope and a sack. \nMany of the refugees have spoken of ethnic Rakhine Buddhist civilians joining the Myanmar army in its attacks. Myanmar denies that and has blamed Muslim insurgents for the violence. \nMyanmar has largely sealed the area off to aid workers and reporters. \nRights groups say satellite images show about 80 smouldering Muslim villages. They have seen evidence of arson attacks on Buddhist villagers, but on a much smaller scale. \nMost of the new arrivals said their villages had been torched on Friday, when huge clouds of smoke were clearly seen over Myanmar. \n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s nothing left,\xe2\x80\x9d said a Nurhaba, 23, who said she was from a village close to Maungdaw town. \nAbout a million Rohingya lived in Rakhine State until the recent violence. Most face draconian travel restrictions and are denied citizenship in a country where many Buddhists regard them as illegal immigrants from Bangladesh. \nMyanmar government leader and Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi has faced a barrage of criticism from abroad for not stopping the violence. \nThe military remains in charge of security and there is little sympathy for the Rohingya in a country where the end of army rule has unleashed old animosities. The military campaign in Rakhine State has wide support. \nSuu Kyi is due to speak to the nation on Tuesday about a crisis the United States has called a \xe2\x80\x9cdefining moment\xe2\x80\x9d for her country. \nU.S. Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Patrick Murphy is due in Myanmar this week.  \nHe will travel to Sittwe, the capital of Rakhine State, to meet government officials and representatives of different communities, including Rohingya, but he is not seeking to travel to the conflict zone in northern Rakhine State. \n\xe2\x80\x98STRATEGICALLY SOUND\xe2\x80\x99 \nHuman Rights Watch said Myanmar security forces were disregarding world condemnation and the time had come to impose tougher measures that the generals could not ignore. \nIt called for governments to \xe2\x80\x9cimpose travel bans and asset freezes on security officials implicated in serious abuses; expand existing arms embargoes to include all military sales, assistance, and cooperation; and place a ban on financial transactions with key ... military-owned enterprises\xe2\x80\x9d. \nFor years, the United States and Western allies imposed sanctions on Myanmar in support of Suu Kyi\xe2\x80\x99s campaign for democracy. Its response was to forge closer ties with China. \nU.S.-Myanmar ties have been improving since the military began withdrawing from government in 2011, and paved the way for a 2015 election won by Suu Kyi\xe2\x80\x99s party. \nA Trump administration official said the violence made it harder to build warmer ties, and there would likely be some \xe2\x80\x9ceasing\xe2\x80\x9d in the short term, but he did not expect a return to sanctions. \n\xe2\x80\x9cPeople are too invested in the last five years of thawing, which is understood by everyone to be strategically sound,\xe2\x80\x9d said the official, who declined to be identified. \n\xe2\x80\x9cLong-term, the trajectory is probably tighter relations.\xe2\x80\x9d \nIn a rare expression of support for the Rohingya from within Myanmar, a group from the Karen ethnic minority, called for the military to halt its operations and for economic sanctions to be considered. \nFor decades of army battled autonomy-seeking Karen insurgents that sent more than 100,000 villagers fleeing to Thailand. The insurgents have now made peace. \nBangladesh is struggling to cope with the refugees  and aid workers fear people could die due to a lack of food, shelter and water, given the numbers. \nBangladesh has said all refugees must go home. Myanmar has said it will take back those who can verify their citizenship. \nSeveral thousand protesters tried to march on the Myanmar embassy in the Bangladeshi capital, Dhaka, but police kept them well back. \nFor an interactive on the Rohingya exodus, click: \n \n'

aS'Was President Trump\xe2\x80\x99s bipartisan hurricane relief/debt ceiling/government funding \n last week simply a \xe2\x80\x9cbipartisan moment,\xe2\x80\x9d as the House speaker, Paul Ryan, put it? Probably, given this president\xe2\x80\x99s pattern of poor impulse control and of reverting to base politics. But it\xe2\x80\x99s tempting nevertheless to imagine what Mr. Trump might achieve if he could see beyond momentary, tactical wins. Hints of bipartisan consensus are popping up in Congress around enough significant issues to suggest that a determined, strategically minded president \xe2\x80\x94 yes, we know, but bear with us \xe2\x80\x94 could strike a number of important deals.\nThe legislation Mr. Trump signed on Friday provides $15 billion for hurricane and flooding victims and includes measures to keep the government funded until Dec. 8, instead of Sept. 30, and to extend the nation\xe2\x80\x99s borrowing authority. The extension delays the type of Tea Party-led showdown over spending and debt that has shut down the government before, but it also forces Republicans to engage in this politically damaging fight on the eve of an election year.\nMr. Trump struck this bargain under the disapproving noses of his party\xe2\x80\x99s own leaders, Mr. Ryan and the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, in an Oval Office meeting with his new pals \xe2\x80\x9cChuck and Nancy\xe2\x80\x9d: the Senate minority leader, Chuck Schumer, and the House minority leader, Nancy Pelosi. Gleeful at media coverage of his shockingly bipartisan move, Mr. Trump called Mr. Schumer last week to talk about \n. So how could these unlikely allies actually make headway? Here are a few areas where capital insiders believe progress is possible:\n This season\xe2\x80\x99s devastating hurricanes in two states that voted for Mr. Trump make this an obvious prospect. Last week\xe2\x80\x99s deal granted an extension until December of this inefficient, heavily indebted program, which was set to lapse on Sept. 30. Given that Florida and Texas will require billions in payouts, this is a ripe moment for Congress and Mr. Trump to get behind an \n of an outmoded program that does nothing to discourage people from building, and rebuilding, in areas prone to catastrophic flooding. They could take steps to put the program on firmer financial footing by better tying premiums to risk, buying out homes susceptible to repeated catastrophic flooding, updating mapping to reflect current climate and flooding patterns, and helping policyholders finance improvements, like raising their homes, that would reduce payouts later.\n Congress must vote by Sept. 30 to extend the Children\xe2\x80\x99s Health Insurance Program, which provides coverage for nine million low-income children. Democrats see the legislation as a vehicle for an amendment to extend for a year Affordable Care Act subsidies that reduce deductibles and co-pays for lower-income enrollees. Conservatives would normally have little interest in this, but state governors of both parties are demanding that Congress extend the A.C.A. subsidies now. Insurers must sign Obamacare participation contracts \n, and action before then would encourage insurers to re-up, and help stabilize rates. Senator Lamar Alexander, chairman of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, \n extending the subsidies. Instead of following through on his threat to blow up Obamacare by withholding them, Mr. Trump could sign on, and choke off a pointless partisan fight on an issue he\xe2\x80\x99s already lost.\n Mr. Trump\xe2\x80\x99s announcement last week that he intends to rescind President Barack Obama\xe2\x80\x99s Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals order, protecting 800,000 young undocumented immigrants brought to the United States as children from deportation, was widely unpopular. The DACA program will now expire in six months, plunging these immigrants into limbo, and so far, Congress has done nothing but talk about helping them. Democrats see some hope in Mr. Trump\xe2\x80\x99s seeming lack of commitment to his own draconian edict \xe2\x80\x94 last week, \xe2\x80\x9cNancy\xe2\x80\x9d persuaded him to tweet reassurance to those affected. It\xe2\x80\x99s a slim reed, but they hope he will pressure Republicans to act on the Dream Act, a 16-year-old proposal to resolve these immigrants\xe2\x80\x99 legal status permanently. Republicans, no doubt aware how it would look to subject 800,000 young people to deportation in a congressional election year, say they\xe2\x80\x99re working on it, but on Monday the Senate Judiciary Committee postponed a hearing on the issue. Congress is deeply divided over immigration policy, but the DACA deadline should stir decisive action.\nAs difficult as those items might be, there are other, tougher possibilities.\n In February, Democrats called Mr. Trump\xe2\x80\x99s bluff on his promise for a $1 trillion infrastructure spending program by sending him an outline proposal. The response? Radio silence. Mr. Trump has no plan, only vague suggestions of spurring investment through tax incentives. Democrats want direct spending. For that to happen, Mr. Trump would have to roll even more Republicans than he did on Friday. Given his lack of preparation, it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t look likely, but this is one job-creating promise his voters should expect him to keep.\n Mr. Trump has said he will cut taxes for working Americans, but so far, the White House has released only broad principles, including some, like tax cuts for the wealthy, that Democrats will not accept. House Republicans on the Ways and Means Committee were working to write a major tax-cut bill to avoid closing 2017 without a single big legislative win. That\xe2\x80\x99s looking like a pipe dream, and for Mr. Trump to move what he says is a top priority, he needs a plan that at least some Democrats can support. \xe2\x80\x9cChuck and Nancy\xe2\x80\x9d want a plan that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t add to the deficit and that includes the promised middle-class tax cuts and a modest trim to corporate tax rates financed through closing tax law loopholes. They don\xe2\x80\x99t want tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans. A compromise will be long, if ever, in coming.\nMr. Trump and his new Democratic friends could work on more. They could raise spending caps set to kick in next month by matching increases in military spending that Republicans want with increases in domestic spending that Democrats favor. They could back a proposal to automatically increase the debt ceiling, ending perennial partisan battles over what used to be a routine vote essentially recognizing the debts Congress has already incurred.\nThey could agree that a \xe2\x80\x9cwall\xe2\x80\x9d on the Mexican border is a dumb idea and focus on fixing the broken immigration system (that\xe2\x80\x99s a \n dream \xe2\x80\x94 Mr. Trump has threatened to shut down the government over spending on the wall).\nGiven the continuing Russia investigations, bipartisan bitterness, the limitations of the legislative calendar and Mr. Trump himself, we have no real reason to expect his bipartisan impulse to harden into practice. But we still hope that the president who has said making deals is how \xe2\x80\x9cI get my kicks\xe2\x80\x9d might want to turn last week\xe2\x80\x99s one-off into a streak.\n'

aS'Umar ibn al-Khattab, a chief adviser and successor to the Prophet Muhammad, was the last truly just ruler in the Arab world, and he died 1,400 years ago. Khattab was called \xe2\x80\x9cal-Farooq\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 the one who distinguishes between right and wrong.\nHe also uttered one of the most beautiful phrases in Arab history: \xe2\x80\x9cHow can you turn people into slaves when their mothers gave birth to them as free human beings?\xe2\x80\x9d\nKhattab extended the Islamic empire as far as Persia and was renowned for establishing evenhanded governance throughout the conquered lands, including in what is now \n.\nDamascus is a pivot point for understanding history and its movements. Conquered countless times, the city has always managed to remain steadfastly itself when its occupiers change.\nDuring the last century, Damascus established many of the essentials of democracy: elections, a parliament, political parties, anti-government protests, freedom of the press.\nThen came the Baath Party coup in 1963. Hafez al-Assad snatched freedom and instituted a paranoid regime. In 2000 his son \n succeeded him, and promised \xe2\x80\x94 at first \xe2\x80\x94 to redeem Syria. But the reform movement stalled.\nIn March 2011, in the midst of the Arab Spring, \n, demanding democratic reforms and the release of political prisoners. Security forces opened fire \xe2\x80\x94 and a revolution began, gradually convulsing all of Syria.\nIn a video from that time, President Bashar al-Assad\xe2\x80\x99s soldiers trampled a group of young protesters shackled in chains on the ground: You want freedom, you animals? Tell me: What is freedom? That was the question. And the Assad regime responded decisively.\nMeanwhile, in an area of Syria seized by Al Qaeda, a video camera documented how foreign fighters from Chechnya, France, Saudi Arabia and Tunisia were terrorizing the young people of the Syrian revolution, tearing down their flag. Then Al Qaeda posted signs on the roads under its control: \xe2\x80\x9cDemocracy Is Blasphemy.\xe2\x80\x9d\nThe Syrian tragedy came to dominate screens worldwide. And the question for Arab nations was clear: Do you understand the fate of those who demand freedom and democracy? This question, which was answered with Syrian blood, confirmed that this dreadful Arab Spring must end in Damascus.\nAmerica and the West confined their intervention mainly to words, as if statements alone would counter the Assad regime\xe2\x80\x99s brutality and the hatefulness of the imported terrorists. In our time, terrorism has emerged as an effective prescription for treating all diseases \xe2\x80\x94 a postmodern sorcery that has opened Syria\xe2\x80\x99s doors to thousands of jihadis from around the world.\nOnce in Syria, these bearded men drove tanks and fired machine guns, applying what they had learned from playing video games. Fantasy blended with fact so that the two were hard to separate.\nAs terrorists streamed in and Syria erupted, the free world kept a safe distance. In 2014, President Barack Obama, \n, questioned whether the \xe2\x80\x9cmoderate opposition\xe2\x80\x9d in Syria \xe2\x80\x94 which included \xe2\x80\x9cfarmers or dentists or maybe some radio reporters\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 could ever prevail against \xe2\x80\x9ca battle-hardened regime, with support from external actors who have a lot at stake.\xe2\x80\x9d\nBut if a Syrian dentist says to the world, in effect, \xe2\x80\x9cYou have bad breath,\xe2\x80\x9d what\xe2\x80\x99s wrong with that?\nWe know how the United States has helped sustain brutal regimes in the Middle East and around the world, how it has overthrown democratically elected governments in Latin America and elsewhere. We know that Syria\xe2\x80\x99s oil reserves don\xe2\x80\x99t compare with Iraq\xe2\x80\x99s and that we\xe2\x80\x99re not vital enough to American interests for the United States to intervene on our behalf.\nWe know what happened in Abu Ghraib prison. And we know what happens to people who find themselves at the wrong place when a drone strike hits. This is the power that America and the West can wield. But such power is immoral if it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t assert the values of freedom and democracy for the world\xe2\x80\x99s poor and dispossessed.\nWe Syrians asked for help to end the massacres, to provide safe havens for civilians and to prosecute war criminals. Those pleas were futile. Syrian deaths became a moral scandal for the entire world.\nThe nation\xe2\x80\x99s most courageous men and women were killed while they danced and sang for freedom, dignity and democracy. There is no nobler death than this. Take a moment to view the faces of those who died in the streets and inside detention camps. You can find online the thousands of photos of the dead in government custody leaked by the Syrian defector code-named Caesar.\nThe democratic world failed Syria. I don\xe2\x80\x99t mean the West\xe2\x80\x99s politicians, foreign ministers and generals. I mean its cultural elites, civil societies and human rights organizations. Those are the people who failed us.\nFor us in the Middle East, democracy has brought misery \xe2\x80\x94 at relatively little cost to the West, which always protects its own interests first. Policy is tailored to business concerns. The focus of Western decision-makers today is \xe2\x80\x9cjobs, jobs, jobs \xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d\nThe \n shattered a barrier. The West immediately took revenge on the poor of Afghanistan, and applied democracy there like a handkerchief on a hemorrhage.\nThe supposed existence of weapons of mass destruction provided a pretext for Iraq\xe2\x80\x99s annihilation, which allowed Iran to vandalize an enormous Arab nation. A democracy was created in Baghdad\xe2\x80\x99s Green Zone, an area of just a few kilometers.\nMr. Assad ridiculed Mr. Obama\xe2\x80\x99s porous red lines. The former president claims that he owes a patch of his gray hair to the debates about what the United States should do in Syria. He \n \xe2\x80\x94 which he can\xe2\x80\x99t talk about without being haunted by a photo of a child asphyxiated by sarin gas in Syria.\nCan democracy be achieved through the use of military force? The answer is yes. If the West had intervened in support of the Syrian revolution, democracy would have had a chance. Instead, the Syrian people have been left with democracy\xe2\x80\x99s slogans and lies \xe2\x80\x94 and more destruction and extremism.\nThe world\xe2\x80\x99s free men and women have been tied up and forced to the ground by the leaders of the new era: Donald Trump, Vladimir Putin, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Benjamin Netanyahu and Mr. Assad himself. Each of them applauding while he tramples our backs and yells: You want freedom, you animals? Tell me: What is freedom?\n'

aS'The voter-fraud crusaders who run President Trump\xe2\x80\x99s electoral-integrity commission have found their holy grail: evidence that large-scale illegal voting swung a pivotal Senate election in 2016. \nIn his latest \n, Kris Kobach, the commission\xe2\x80\x99s vice chairman, called it \xe2\x80\x9chighly likely\xe2\x80\x9d that the election of Maggie Hassan, New Hampshire\xe2\x80\x99s Democratic candidate for the Senate, was \xe2\x80\x9cstolen through voter fraud.\xe2\x80\x9d He said it was \xe2\x80\x9cpossible\xe2\x80\x9d that Hillary Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s narrow victory in the state was the result of illegal voting, too.\nMr. Kobach\xe2\x80\x99s evidence for these explosive claims? \xe2\x80\x9cProof,\xe2\x80\x9d he says, that 5,313 people who voted in New Hampshire in 2016 do not actually reside in the state. The theory, which has been \n, is that these voters sneaked over the border \xe2\x80\x94 or were even bused in! \xe2\x80\x94 from neighboring Democratic strongholds like Massachusetts or Vermont, in a huge conspiracy to swing the election.\nThat scheme had national implications, Mr. Kobach wrote \xe2\x80\x94 the Senate failed to repeal Obamacare by one vote.\nAnd he wonders why serious people don\xe2\x80\x99t take him seriously.\nIn his day job as Kansas\xe2\x80\x99 secretary of state, where he plays the \n Mr. Kobach complains that the media\xe2\x80\x99s response to his efforts to safeguard America\xe2\x80\x99s elections is a dismissive, \xe2\x80\x9cMove along, there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing to see here.\xe2\x80\x9d So let\xe2\x80\x99s stop and take a closer look.\nTrue, New Hampshire \n. Mrs. Clinton won by 2,736 votes, or 0.3 percentage points. Ms. Hassan\xe2\x80\x99s margin was slimmer \xe2\x80\x94 1,017 votes out of nearly three-quarters of a million cast.\nAlso apparently true: Data given to the commission by the speaker of the state\xe2\x80\x99s House showed that 6,540 people registered to vote there on Election Day using an out-of-state ID.\nUnder state law, new residents have 60 days to get a New Hampshire driver\xe2\x80\x99s license. Yet of those 6,540 people, Mr. Kobach said, 5,526 have not done so. Of those, only 213 have registered a vehicle in the state, leaving 5,313 voters who are not, as Mr. Kobach put it, \xe2\x80\x9cbona fide residents of the state.\xe2\x80\x9d\nBusted, right? Not quite. In his hunger to expose fraudulent voters, Mr. Kobach omitted \n. New Hampshire law \n people to be \xe2\x80\x9cresidents\xe2\x80\x9d to register and vote. They must only be \xe2\x80\x9cdomiciled\xe2\x80\x9d in the state, meaning that New Hampshire is where they currently live and spend most of their time \xe2\x80\x94 a description that applies, incidentally, to many college students. In 2016, the towns with the highest rates of voters who registered using out-of-state IDs were \n.\nMr. Kobach didn\xe2\x80\x99t say whether he had attempted to contact any of the supposed scofflaws, but \n. The first four it reached identified themselves as college students who lived in New Hampshire last November.\nVice President Mike Pence, the commission\xe2\x80\x99s chairman, \n that the commission had \xe2\x80\x9cno preconceived notions or preordained results.\xe2\x80\x9d That was never credible. It\xe2\x80\x99s laughable now, as Mr. Kobach spouts his latest, wildly irresponsible accusations based on an inaccurate reading of the data and the law.\nRather than admit his obvious biases, Mr. Kobach \n that \xe2\x80\x9cthe mainstream media has ignored the problem of voter fraud and belittled those of us who are trying to do something about it.\xe2\x80\x9d The truth is that Mr. Kobach and his band of vote suppressors belittle themselves, and threaten voting rights nationwide, with their dishonesty.\nIn a convenient stroke of timing, the commission will hold its \n in New Hampshire on Tuesday. The topic is voter confidence in electoral integrity \xe2\x80\x94 amusing coming from the people who\xe2\x80\x99ve done their utmost to undermine that confidence with baseless allegations.\n'

aS'Prime Minister Hun Sen of \n has been in power for more than 30 years. On Wednesday, he vowed to stay in power. \xe2\x80\x9cAfter witnessing the treasonous acts of some Cambodians in recent days,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cI have decided to continue my job for another 10 years.\xe2\x80\x9d\nCitizens might have thought it was up to them to decide, in general elections next year, who will govern their country. Mr. Hun Sen has set them straight: He has no intention of losing that election or future ones to an opposition that did better than expected in the last \n. If this means charging opposition leaders with treason, so be it.\nEarlier this month, Kem Sokha, leader of the opposition Cambodia National Rescue Party, was \n on absurd charges of plotting to overthrow Mr. Hun Sen\xe2\x80\x99s government. The charges were based on a 2013 video in which Mr. Kem Sokha spoke of bringing democratic change to Cambodia.\nMr. Hun Sen\xe2\x80\x99s government has also forced the 24-year-old \n newspaper to close over trumped-up charges of tax evasion. That comes on the heels of the closing of 15 independent radio stations broadcasting programs from Voice of America and Radio Free Asia. \xe2\x80\x9cAfter they close down all the independent newspapers and radio stations,\xe2\x80\x9d the Daily reporter Aun Pheap observed, \xe2\x80\x9cno one will be able to print true information for the upcoming election.\xe2\x80\x9d\nSenator John McCain has \n the Trump administration, which has shown little concern about the global rise of autocracy, to \xe2\x80\x9csend a strong message that the United States is committed to promoting democracy, human rights and rule of law in Cambodia and throughout the world.\xe2\x80\x9d The \n has asked for Mr. Kem Sokha\xe2\x80\x99s release.\nMr. Hun Sen has much at stake. His family has grown \n in a country ranked the most corrupt in Southeast Asia by \n. He has the support of China, which provided Cambodia with nearly \n in loans and investment from 2011 to 2015.\nBut if he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t drop the charges against Mr. Kem Sokha; permit a credible political opposition; and allow The Daily, radio stations and all news outlets to operate freely, the world will know that Cambodia is no longer a democracy.\n'

aS'An inscription on the lobby wall greets visitors in Latin at the offices of the New York City medical examiner. It is an adage familiar to places where autopsies are performed. Reasonably translated, it says: \xe2\x80\x9cLet conversation cease. Let laughter flee. This is the place where death rejoices to help the living.\xe2\x80\x9d\nAnother saying, borrowed from the Book of Proverbs, Chapter 31, might also work were it to be put on that wall: \xe2\x80\x9cSpeak up for those who cannot speak for themselves.\xe2\x80\x9d That, too, is what the medical examiner\xe2\x80\x99s office is about. Rarely has it been called upon to speak up as relentlessly as it has for those whose voices were silenced at the World Trade Center 16 years ago.\nFor the chief medical examiner, Dr. Barbara Sampson, and her staff, the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, are never past. All these years later, the team still strives to \n each of the 2,753 people who were killed in the destruction of the twin towers. \xe2\x80\x9cWe made a commitment to the families that we would do whatever it takes, for as long as it takes,\xe2\x80\x9d Dr. Sampson said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re the family physician to the bereaved.\xe2\x80\x9d\nDeath certificates for the victims were issued long ago. But assigning identities to the 21,905 human remains that were recovered from the wreckage is a separate matter. Only 1,641 of the 2,753 victims \xe2\x80\x94 60 percent \xe2\x80\x94 have been positively identified, mostly through DNA analysis. The success rate is slightly better, 64 percent, in regard to the 405 firefighters, police officers and emergency medical workers who died at ground zero.\nTime has not been a friend of the forensic teams. \n \xe2\x80\x94 a man who, at his family\xe2\x80\x99s request, has not been publicly named \xe2\x80\x94 became known to them a month ago. This was nearly two and a half years after No. 1,640 was identified: \n, a 26-year-old technology specialist who worked on the 97th floor of the south tower. Before that, six months had gone by since No. 1,639: \n, 31, the lone Belgian citizen among the victims. He worked on the 97th floor of the north tower.\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a slow go,\xe2\x80\x9d Dr. Sampson said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re now down to the ones that are very difficult to get useful DNA.\xe2\x80\x9d\nThe genetic material that\xe2\x80\x99s available is sometimes no more than the tiniest patch of flesh. Some remains lay in the wreckage for weeks, months, even years \xe2\x80\x94 degraded by water, burning jet fuel and all manner of debris from the downed buildings. In addition, bacterial DNA intermingled with human matter. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was the worst combination of events you could have for a DNA specimen,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dr. Sampson, who has been the city\xe2\x80\x99s chief medical examiner since December 2014.\nRecent scientific advances, including what she described as a bone-extraction technique, made it possible to identify the 1,641st victim. That gives her hope that the process is not stuck. \xe2\x80\x9cI am optimistic we will identify more people,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cBut do I think we will be able to identify every single person? Probably not.\xe2\x80\x9d\nApparently, relatives of the victims have not given up. None of them have told the medical examiner\xe2\x80\x99s office that, after the passage of so much time, they no longer care about matching slivers of remains to their loved ones. \xe2\x80\x9cWe work very closely with the families,\xe2\x80\x9d Dr. Sampson said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe know every family\xe2\x80\x99s wishes as for what they want us to do.\xe2\x80\x9d\nSince 2014, unclaimed remains have rested 70 feet underground in a repository at the \n in Lower Manhattan. Only members of the medical examiner\xe2\x80\x99s office may enter the area (though no laboratory work is done there). Next to the repository is a quiet space known as the reflection room, reserved for Sept. 11 families and their guests. Not surprisingly, the anniversary is a time of pilgrimage there. In a typical month, 20 or so people go to the room. On Sept. 11 alone last year, 65 visited.\nJust about every week, a few families will call the medical examiner\xe2\x80\x99s office with questions, mostly of a technical or administrative nature. Still, often enough, there\xe2\x80\x99s a catch in the caller\xe2\x80\x99s voice or a verbal tic that makes plain how time is an imperfect healer. \xe2\x80\x9cYou can get a sense of despair,\xe2\x80\x9d Dr. Sampson said.\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd hope,\xe2\x80\x9d she added.\n'

aS' was hard to digest until one realized it was part of a much larger and increasingly disturbing pattern in the Trump administration. On Aug. 18, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine received \n from the Interior Department that it stop work on what seemed a useful and overdue study of the health risks of mountaintop-removal coal mining.\nThe $1 million study had been requested by two West Virginia health agencies following multiple studies suggesting increased rates of \n, \n and other health problems among people living near big surface coal-mining operations in Appalachia. The order to shut it down came just hours before the scientists were scheduled to meet with affected residents of Kentucky.\nThe Interior Department said the project was put on hold as a result of an agencywide budgetary review of grants and projects costing more than $100,000.\nThis was \n to anyone who had been paying attention. From Day 1, the White House and its lackeys in certain federal agencies have been waging what amounts to a war on science, appointing people with few scientific credentials to key positions, defunding programs that could lead to a cleaner and safer environment and a healthier population, and, most ominously, censoring scientific inquiry that could inform the public and government policy.\nEven allowing for justifiable budgetary reasons, in nearly every case the principal motive seemed the same: to serve commercial interests whose profitability could be affected by health and safety rules.\nThe coal mining industry is a conspicuous example. The practice of blowing the tops off mountains to get at underlying coal seams has been attacked for years by public health and environmental interests and by many of the families whose livelihoods depend on coal. But Mr. Trump and his department heads have made a very big deal of saving jobs in a declining industry that is already under severe pressure from market forces, including competition from cheaper natural gas. An unfavorable health study would inject unwelcome reality into Mr. Trump\xe2\x80\x99s rosy promises of a job boom fueled by \xe2\x80\x9c\n.\xe2\x80\x9d\nThis is a president who has never shown much fidelity to facts, unless they are his own alternative ones. Yet if there is any unifying theme beyond that to the administration\xe2\x80\x99s war on science, apart from its devotion to big industry and its reflexively antiregulatory mind-set, it is horror of the words \xe2\x80\x9cclimate change.\xe2\x80\x9d\nThis starts with Mr. Trump, who has called global warming a hoax and pulled the United States from the Paris agreement on climate change. Among his first presidential acts, he instructed Scott Pruitt, the Environmental Protection Agency administrator, to deep-six President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s Clean Power Plan, aimed at reducing carbon dioxide emissions from coal-fired power plants, and ordered Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke to roll back Obama-era rules reducing the venting from natural gas wells of methane, another powerful greenhouse gas.\nMr. Trump has been properly sympathetic to the victims of hurricanes Harvey and Irma, but the fact that there is almost certainly a connection between a warming earth and increasingly destructive natural events seems not to have occurred to him or his fellow deniers. Mr. Pruitt and his colleagues have enthusiastically jumped to the task of rescinding regulations that might address the problem, meanwhile presiding over a no less ominous development: a governmentwide purge of people, particularly scientists, whose research and conclusions about the human contribution to climate change do not support the administration\xe2\x80\x99s agenda.\nMr. Pruitt, for instance, is replacing dozens of members on the E.P.A.\xe2\x80\x99s scientific advisory boards; in March, he \n at least five scientists from the agency\xe2\x80\x99s 18-member Board of Scientific Counselors, to be replaced, according to a spokesman, with advisers \xe2\x80\x9cwho understand the impact of regulations on the regulated community.\xe2\x80\x9d Last month the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration \n its 15-member \n, a panel set up to help \n the findings of the National Climate Assessment into concrete guidance for businesses, governments and the public.\nIn June, Mr. Pruitt \n a coal industry lobbying group that he was preparing to convene a \xe2\x80\x9cred team\xe2\x80\x9d of researchers to challenge the notion, broadly accepted among climate scientists, that carbon dioxide and other emissions from fossil fuels are the primary drivers of climate change.\nAndrew Dessler, a professor of atmospheric science at Texas A&M University, called the red team plan a \xe2\x80\x9cdumb idea\xe2\x80\x9d that\xe2\x80\x99s like \xe2\x80\x9ca red team-blue team exercise about whether gravity exists.\xe2\x80\x9d Rick Perry, the energy secretary, former Texas governor and climate skeptic, \n as \xe2\x80\x94 get this \xe2\x80\x94 a way to \xe2\x80\x9cget the politicians out of the room.\xe2\x80\x9d Given his and Mr. Pruitt\xe2\x80\x99s ideological and historical financial ties to the fossil fuel industry, it is hard to think of a more cynical use of public money.\nEven the official vocabulary of global warming has changed, as if the problem can be made to evaporate by describing it in more benign terms. At the Department of Agriculture, staff members are \n words like \xe2\x80\x9cweather extremes\xe2\x80\x9d in lieu of \xe2\x80\x9cclimate change,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cbuild soil organic matter, increase nutrient use efficiency\xe2\x80\x9d instead of \xe2\x80\x9creduce greenhouse gases.\xe2\x80\x9d The Department of Energy has scrubbed the words \xe2\x80\x9cclean energy\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cnew energy\xe2\x80\x9d from its websites, and has cut links to clean or renewable energy initiatives and programs, according to the Environmental Data & Governance Initiative, which monitors federal websites.\nAt the E.P.A., a former Trump campaign assistant named John Konkus \n the \xe2\x80\x9cdouble C-word,\xe2\x80\x9d meaning \xe2\x80\x9cclimate change,\xe2\x80\x9d from the agency\xe2\x80\x99s research grant solicitations, and he views every application for research money through a similar lens. The E.P.A. is even considering \n out climate change-related exhibits in a museum depicting the agency\xe2\x80\x99s history.\nThe bias against science finds reinforcement in Mr. Trump\xe2\x80\x99s budget and the people he has chosen for important scientific jobs. Mr. Trump\xe2\x80\x99s 2018 federal budget proposal would cut nondefense research and development money across the government.\nThe president has proposed cutting nearly $6 billion from the National Institutes of Health, the nation\xe2\x80\x99s \n of biomedical research. The National Science Foundation, a government agency that funds a variety of scientific and engineering research projects, would be trimmed by about 11 percent. Plant and animal-related science at the Agriculture Department, data analysis at the Census Bureau and earth science at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration would all suffer.\nIt is amazing but true, given the present circumstances, that the Trump budget would eliminate $250 million for NOAA\xe2\x80\x99s coastal research programs that prepare communities for rising seas and worsening storms. The E.P.A.\xe2\x80\x99s Global Change program would be likewise eliminated. This makes the budget director, Mick Mulvaney, delirious with joy. He complains of \xe2\x80\x9ccrazy things\xe2\x80\x9d the Obama administration did to study climate, and boasts: \xe2\x80\x9cDo a lot of the E.P.A. reductions aim at reducing the focus on climate science? Yes.\xe2\x80\x9d\nAs to \n, denial and mediocrity abound. Last week, Mr. Trump \n David Zatezalo, a former coal company chief executive who has repeatedly clashed with federal mine safety regulators, as assistant secretary of labor for the federal Mine Safety and Health Administration. He \n Jim Bridenstine, a Republican congressman from Oklahoma with no science or space background, as NASA administrator. Sam Clovis, Mr. Trump\xe2\x80\x99s nomination to be the Agriculture Department\xe2\x80\x99s chief scientist, is \n: He\xe2\x80\x99s a former talk-radio host and incendiary blogger who has labeled climate research \xe2\x80\x9cjunk science.\xe2\x80\x9d\nFrom the beginning, Mr. Trump, Mr. Pruitt, Mr. Zinke and Mr. Perry \xe2\x80\x94 to name the Big Four on environmental and energy issues \xe2\x80\x94 have been promising a new day to just about anyone discomfited by a half-century of bipartisan environmental law, whether it be the developers and farmers who feel threatened by efforts to enforce the Clean Water Act, oil and gas drillers seeking leases they do not need on federal land, chemical companies seeking relaxation from rules governing dangerous pesticides, automakers asked to improve fuel efficiency or utilities required to make further investments in technology to reduce ground-level pollutants.\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe future ain\xe2\x80\x99t what it used to be at the E.P.A.,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Pruitt is \n of his agency. These words could also apply to just about every other cabinet department and regulatory body in this administration. What his words really mean is that the future isn\xe2\x80\x99t going to be nearly as promising for ordinary Americans as it should be.\n'

aS'Another summer has passed, and still there seems to be no lasting solution to one of the great humanitarian conundrums of our time: how to resettle the thousands of migrants who continue to risk dangerous passage across the Mediterranean in search of sanctuary from violence in the Middle East and Africa. The number of arrivals in Greece has steadily declined since 2015, after measures that all but closed the route from Turkey. But the problem will remain so long as conflict and poverty drive people to take huge risks in the hope of reaching Europe.\nIt is indisputably a difficult problem, but it has not been made easier by the inhospitable attitudes of some of the countries of Central and Eastern Europe \xe2\x80\x94 Hungary in particular \xe2\x80\x94 which have stubbornly blocked entry to refugees. This is a shame, given that back in 1989, Hungary led the way in opening its borders to let the people of Communist-ruled Eastern Europe move freely between East and West. Effectively throwing its lot in with the West, \n that it was guided \xe2\x80\x9cby generally accepted international principles of human rights and humanitarian consideration.\xe2\x80\x9d\nNo longer, it seems. When the European Union decided in the summer of 2015 to help Italy and Greece cope with a huge wave of migration by resettling 120,000 people in other European countries, Hungary and Slovakia took the decision to the Court of Justice of the European Union. On Wednesday, the court threw out their case, which seemed only to stiffen Hungary\xe2\x80\x99s opposition. With unconscious incongruity, the country\xe2\x80\x99s foreign minister, Peter Szijjarto, angrily declared that \xe2\x80\x9cpolitics has raped European law and values,\xe2\x80\x9d vowing that no one would be relocated to Hungary against its wishes.\nThe Court of Justice decision will not greatly improve the lot of migrants, and not just because of Hungary\xe2\x80\x99s callousness. The program for migrants from Greece and Italy has resettled barely a quarter of the people it was supposed to help, and Eastern European countries were allotted a tiny fraction to begin with. And the European Union does not have the tools to effectively punish recalcitrant nations.\nStill, it is incumbent on Europe to continue to look for humanitarian solutions, whether by helping to resolve the conflicts or ease the poverty that drive people to flee, or by making room for those who reach its shores. That effort and burden must be shared, and it must be based on international law and European values, which include tolerance, cultural diversity, protection of minorities and a rejection of xenophobia.\nHungary and its neighbors are not alone in trying to keep immigrants out. President Trump has set a scandalous example by his demagogic policy on immigration, Britain\xe2\x80\x99s vote to leave the European Union was based largely on blocking immigrants, and populist and nationalist parties have exploited immigration to gain strength in many other European nations.\nBut it is particularly sad to see countries that so poignantly celebrated the lifting of the Iron Curtain now argue, as Hungary does, that being asked to take in a small number of Muslim immigrants is somehow a violation of European laws and values. Hungary\xe2\x80\x99s hard-line prime minister, Viktor Orban, has gone so far as to ask for European Union money to tighten his border against migrants \xe2\x80\x94 an arrogant request promptly dismissed by the president of the European Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker. The Court of Justice ruling should stand as a strong reminder to Hungary and its neighbors that the principles of human rights and humanitarian considerations they once so ardently embraced are not optional.\n'

aS'It is commonly believed that Russia\xe2\x80\x99s interference in the 2016 presidential campaign consisted mainly of the hacking and leaking of Democratic emails and unfavorable stories circulated abroad about Hillary Clinton. But as a startling \n of The New York Times, and new research by the cybersecurity firm FireEye, now reveal, the Kremlin\xe2\x80\x99s stealth intrusion into the election was far broader and more complex, involving a cyberarmy of bloggers posing as Americans and spreading propaganda and disinformation to an American electorate on Facebook, Twitter and other platforms.\nWhether the Trump campaign was colluding with the Russians is, of course, the question at the heart of the investigation by the special counsel, Robert Mueller. Donald Trump Jr. \n Senate investigators this week that he met with Russians claiming to have dirt on Mrs. Clinton because it could concern her \xe2\x80\x9cfitness, character or qualifications.\xe2\x80\x9d But Russia\xe2\x80\x99s guile in using hackers and counterfeit Facebook and Twitter accounts to undermine her campaign represents a new dimension in disinformation that must not go unchallenged by Mr. Trump, however much he may have benefited from it and however close his relationship to Russian President Vladimir Putin.\nThe attack, according to the Times report, involved hundreds or even thousands of fake accounts on Facebook and Twitter that regularly posted anti-Clinton messages.\nTo viewers, the messages resembled the normal partisan give-and-take one expects in a political campaign; in fact they came from foreign sources. Many of the rapid-fire salvos came from automated accounts.\nIn the normal bounds of American politics, such partisan messaging is required by law to account for its source \xe2\x80\x94 as in \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m candidate McAdoo and I approve this message.\xe2\x80\x9d But in the riotous world of social media, disclosure is not a high priority.\nNow that the scheming is clear, Facebook and Twitter say they are reviewing the 2016 race and studying how to defend against such meddling in the future. \n Wednesday the removal of 470 fake accounts and pages \xe2\x80\x9clikely\xe2\x80\x9d engineered in Russia. It requires account identities and can challenge the bona fides of fakers. Twitter does not, nor does it prohibit automated accounts, which can create fake \xe2\x80\x9ctrends\xe2\x80\x9d to attract readers. Between them, the sites have more than two billion accounts.\nRussia has not exactly hidden its intentions. In February of last year, a top cyberintelligence adviser to Mr. Putin, Andrey Krutskikh, hinted at a Moscow conference of a possible attack. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m warning you: We are on the verge of having something in the information arena which will allow us to talk to the Americans as equals,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. Mr. Putin has insisted there is \xe2\x80\x9cno proof\xe2\x80\x9d Russia is directing the work of \xe2\x80\x9cfree spirited\xe2\x80\x9d hackers \xe2\x80\x94 despite decisive American intelligence to the contrary.\nFacing the Russian challenge will involve complicated issues dealing with secret foreign efforts to undermine American free speech. National security agencies in Washington have identified Russian involvement in the spread of the email leaks that bedeviled Mrs. Clinton, and the Russian military intelligence agency\xe2\x80\x99s use of hackers to penetrate state voting systems.\nBut it is unclear whether any federal agency is focused specifically on the problems Mr. Shane and FireEye have illuminated \xe2\x80\x94 foreign intervention through social media to feed partisan anger and suspicion in a polarized nation.\nThe social media scheming is further evidence of what amounted to unprecedented foreign invasion of American democracy. If President Trump and Congress are not outraged by this, American voters should ask why.\n'

aS'New York City\xe2\x80\x99s public school system set an important national example this week when it made \n to all of its 1.1 million students regardless of income level. The program ensures that more children will get proper nutrition during the school day. It will also relieve the sense of stigma and shame that often leads children to refuse subsidized meals \xe2\x80\x94 and go hungry \xe2\x80\x94 rather than let classmates find out that their families are poor.\nThree quarters of New York City schoolchildren had already qualified for free or reduced-price lunches. The new initiative reaches another 200,000 children, saving their families about $300 a year per child. These additional lunches are not expected to cost the city more money, thanks to the federal Community Eligibility Provision program, under which schools that offer free lunch and breakfast to all children are reimbursed based on students\xe2\x80\x99 poverty level. A new state data system that matched poor families with the schools their children attend has allowed the city to sign up for the program.\nNew York\xe2\x80\x99s new program puts it in the company of major cities like Boston, Chicago, Dallas and Detroit. Nationally, however, far too many school districts still employ barbaric policies under which children are openly humiliated when their parents cannot pay lunch bills. These \n include berating students, stamping their arms with messages like \xe2\x80\x9cI need lunch money\xe2\x80\x9d and throwing meals into the garbage while hungry children stand by.\nMissing meals and experiencing hunger impede a child\xe2\x80\x99s ability to learn and achieve. Yet a \n of 50 large school districts by the Food Research and Action Center, a national nonprofit group, shows that many school meal policies are quite retrograde on this front. For example, only eight of the districts offer free lunch to all students. Among the 40 schools that have established policies for dealing with unpaid meal bills, only a few explicitly prohibit schools from humiliating children. Worse still, some schools actually deny meals to older students who cannot pay.\nShockingly, most school policies do not even mention the fact that families in financial trouble might be eligible for free or reduced-price meals. Struggling families that fail to pay school lunch fees are driven further into poverty by debt collectors and their onerous fees.\nAs the Food Research and Action Center survey shows, these policies are cruel, counterproductive and costly. By taking advantage of the federal Community Eligibility Provision, schools can increase reimbursement for meals \xe2\x80\x94 thus wiping out meal debt \xe2\x80\x94 while they improve nutrition, eliminate stigma and cut administrative costs. It makes good sense for schools that serve poor children to register for this program without delay. Food, after all, is one of the fuels necessary to get through the school day.\n'

aS'Among the most appalling aspects of the financial collapse nine years ago was that no matter how reckless and predatory big financial institutions had been, they had grown so big and so interconnected that the federal government found itself forced to prop them up to avoid failures that would wreck the economy. The resulting bailouts, which included \n for executives responsible for the fiasco, provoked deep public anger and became a rallying cry for populists on the right and the left.\nTo reduce the risks from too-big-to-fail institutions, Congress in 2010 passed the Dodd-Frank financial oversight bill. But ever since, even as the stock market soared, wages stagnated and the victims of predatory lenders continued to struggle, Wall Street\xe2\x80\x99s champions have demanded an end to Dodd-Frank\xe2\x80\x99s regulations.\nStep by step, the Trump administration has made it clear that it is on their side, that Wall Street need have no real concern about Dodd-Frank\xe2\x80\x99s provisions and that the lessons of the financial crisis will be ignored.\nThe Treasury Department \n the second in a series of reports on Dodd-Frank. The \n called for weakening constraints on banks, including loosening restrictions on their traders and backing off how much loss-absorbing capital banks are required to hold.\nThe next report is expected to propose lighter regulation for financial firms other than banks, by restricting the government\xe2\x80\x99s ability to designate insurance companies, corporate lending subsidiaries and other firms as too big to fail, a label that subjects a company to additional rules and higher capital requirements.\nThe rollback would be blind to history. Non-banks proved as unstable as banks in the crisis. After the collapse of Lehman Brothers, Wall Street\xe2\x80\x99s other big investment houses survived by converting into federally insured banks, and raking in bailouts, cheap loans from the Fed and federal guarantees. The insurer American International Group required a $182 billion bailout, and GE Capital needed $139 billion in federal backing to borrow money to stay afloat. Federal deposit insurance was temporarily extended to money market funds to prevent a catastrophic run on the financial system.\nWeakening the regulation of institutions that are not banks would weaken a regulatory process that is already too restrained. The only such companies designated as too big to fail now are A.I.G. and Prudential Financial, both behemoth insurers. Federal regulators rescinded a too-big-to-fail designation for GE Capital in 2016 after the firm downsized. A court rescinded another too-big-to-fail designation, for MetLife, in a \n. Similarly, regulators decided not to designate huge asset managers like BlackRock and Fidelity as too big to fail, \nthat could prove unwise.\nThe anti-Dodd-Frank reports by the Trump Treasury do not on their own change law or regulations. But they send a signal to Wall Street that the administration opposes tough federal supervision and regulation, a stance that is also reflected in Mr. Trump\xe2\x80\x99s \n to head various financial regulatory agencies.\nFinancial corporations are being given the nod to re-establish their unholy alliances, in which vast interconnections through lending, borrowing, derivatives and other transactions spread and amplify risks throughout the financial system \xe2\x80\x94 while regulators look the other way. The greater the risk, the greater the potential return for bank executives and traders. For everyone else, heightened risk means greater economic peril, including threatened destruction of jobs, pay, savings, home equity and career opportunity.\nThe Republican-controlled Congress is too jammed up to move ahead with legislation to weaken Dodd-Frank. But that won\xe2\x80\x99t be necessary, since the administration is doing a good job of dismantling the regulations on its own.\n'

aS'Nikki Haley laid the Trump administration\xe2\x80\x99s cards on the table this week \n aimed at sabotaging one of the Obama administration\xe2\x80\x99s most important diplomatic initiatives \xe2\x80\x94 the 2015 nuclear deal with Iran. President Trump promised during his campaign to kill the deal, despite its clear benefits to American security. Ms. Haley, the United States ambassador to the United Nations, has set forth a scheme that could not only allow Mr. Trump to carry out his threat, but also shift final responsibility to Congress.\nThe whole idea makes no sense to anyone but Mr. Trump\xe2\x80\x99s hard-line advisers, who see Iran as the root of evil in the Persian Gulf. Instead of making sure the agreement works, the president would give Iran an excuse to revive what had been a rapidly advancing nuclear capability and confront the world with another intractable nuclear challenge in addition to North Korea.\nThe deal, negotiated with Tehran by the United States and other major powers, imposed strict limits on Iran\xe2\x80\x99s nuclear activities for 10 years in return for a lifting of international and American sanctions. As an added check, Congress requires the administration to certify every 90 days that Iran is abiding by the deal, in order to continue qualifying for relief from American sanctions.\nThe administration has twice reluctantly \n and is required to revisit the issue again next month. Ms. Haley said she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t know what Mr. Trump\xe2\x80\x99s decision will be. The International Atomic Energy Agency, which put unprecedented strong procedures in place for monitoring Iran\xe2\x80\x99s activities, has repeatedly judged that Iran is fulfilling its obligations. In July, Gen. Paul Selva of the Air Force, vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told Congress that based on evidence submitted to intelligence agencies, \xe2\x80\x9cit appears that Iran is in compliance.\xe2\x80\x9d\nMr. Trump, however, has reportedly kept pushing his advisers to find a way out, and Ms. Haley appears to have answered the call. The essence of her case, presented Tuesday to the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank, is that technical compliance with the nuclear-related commitments is not sufficient and that the president \xe2\x80\x9chas grounds\xe2\x80\x9d to declare that Iran is not fulfilling the agreement because of other destabilizing or objectionable behavior, like its ballistic missile tests, support for Hezbollah and hostility toward the United States.\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe must consider the whole jigsaw puzzle,\xe2\x80\x9d \n, \xe2\x80\x9cnot just one of its pieces.\xe2\x80\x9d\nShe\xe2\x80\x99s wrong. While Iran indeed is engaging in some very worrisome pursuits, the deal is confined to the nuclear program. As long as Tehran is staying within those limits, Mr. Trump has no reason not to certify compliance. The United States and its partners need to find other ways, including sanctions already in place and dialogue, to mitigate Iran\xe2\x80\x99s other behavior. In the national interest, Washington has often held its nose and dealt with aggressive or unsavory governments, among them the Soviet Union, Russia, Pakistan and Egypt.\nMs. Haley misleads further when she argues that it would not constitute an American withdrawal from the deal if Mr. Trump didn\xe2\x80\x99t certify Iranian compliance. That kind of spin will convince no one, and it won\xe2\x80\x99t protect Mr. Trump for being blamed for whatever follows, including outrage from France, Britain, Germany, Russia and China, which are also parties to the agreement.\nMs. Haley\xe2\x80\x99s scheme would also allow Mr. Trump to punt the deal\xe2\x80\x99s fate to Congress, further distancing himself from responsibility. Under American law, failure to issue the certification would open the door for Congress to reimpose sanctions on Iran. Would it be so irresponsible? Congress overwhelmingly opposed the deal when it was negotiated, but many critics now see its value. In any case, lawmakers must demand concrete evidence of Iranian noncompliance, if there is any, before reimposing sanctions.\nIf Mr. Trump blows up the nuclear deal, then what? None of the original opponents of the deal, in or out of Congress, including Mr. Trump, have offered any plausible alternative for restraining Iran\xe2\x80\x99s nuclear ambitions. Without such an alternative, a reckless decision to honor a reckless campaign promise invites Iran to pursue an unfettered path to a bomb. And if deals with the United States cannot be trusted, North Korea will have one more reason to keep pursuing its nuclear program.\n'

Her family has given the police closed-circuit \n of the murder scene, so that the killers, and anyone who may have ordered the assassination, may be brought to justice.\nThis has not happened so far in the murders of other outspoken critics of right-wing Hindu nationalists. \n, whose campaigns against superstitious practices angered many Hindu religious activists, was shot to death near his home in Pune in 2013. Two years ago, \n, a former vice chancellor of Kannada University who spent decades debunking peddlers of superstition, was fatally shot in his home in Dharwad.\nMs. Lankesh had voiced concern about the climate of menace against journalists who didn\xe2\x80\x99t toe the Hindu-nationalist line. If Mr. Modi doesn\xe2\x80\x99t condemn her murder forcefully and denounce the harassment and threats that critics of Hindu militancy face daily, more critics will live in fear of deadly reprisal and Indian democracy will see dark days.\n'

aS'The North Korean nuclear threat is worsening by the day. Tougher economic sanctions have not accomplished much, if anything. Nor has President Trump\xe2\x80\x99s bellicosity. Sunday\xe2\x80\x99s \n was the North\xe2\x80\x99s most powerful blast in the 11 years it has been detonating nuclear weapons. There are signs of another test soon.\nMr. Trump\xe2\x80\x99s approach has so far consisted of sanctions, pressure on China \xe2\x80\x94 North Korea\xe2\x80\x99s chief ally \xe2\x80\x94 and taunts against the government in Pyongyang. These messages have not only produced zero positive results but they have also sowed confusion about his intentions. The president and his team seem unable or unwilling to put together a realistic and coherent strategy that goes beyond pressure tactics and harsh rhetoric to include a serious effort to engage the North Koreans.\nThere have been some inexplicable errors along the way. The latest was to \n, an ally whose cooperation is vital to resolving the North Korea crisis. At a moment when South Korea needs to be able to trust America\xe2\x80\x99s commitments, Mr. Trump has unwisely hinted at abrogating an important bilateral trade deal, thus potentially ceding more economic ground to China, and accused its new president, Moon Jae-in, of \xe2\x80\x9cappeasement\xe2\x80\x9d toward North Korea. The South Koreans are so upset, there is talk among some of developing their own nuclear weapons, which would compound the present insanity.\nContaining the North is not a simple task. President Bill Clinton worked out a deal that froze the North\xe2\x80\x99s plutonium program for eight years, only to see the agreement collapse under George W. Bush. The North\xe2\x80\x99s nuclear program is now far more advanced, making getting rid of it, or even containing it, a lot harder.\nNorth Korea\xe2\x80\x99s leader, Kim Jong-un, is certainly playing a dangerous game; Nikki Haley, the United States ambassador to the United Nations, warned Monday that Mr. Kim is \n But unless he is completely deranged he must know that war with the United States would be suicide. He seems to regard nuclear weapons as his only guarantee of survival in the face of American hostility.\nHe has reason to worry: Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi, the Libyan leader, gave up his nascent nuclear program in 2003 in return for promises of economic integration with the West. But when rebels rose up against him, he was bombed by the United States and its allies, then executed by rebels.\nDefense Secretary Jim Mattis and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson have insisted that the United States is not aiming for regime change. But it could be doing considerably more to lower the temperature and lead the way to a more peaceful solution. On Sunday, Mr. Mattis seemed intent on doing just the opposite, promising a \xe2\x80\x9cmassive military response\xe2\x80\x9d in return for \xe2\x80\x9cany threat\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 not just an attack but the threat of an attack \xe2\x80\x94 against the United States; its territories, like Guam; or its allies. And while Mr. Mattis and Mr. Tillerson have both hinted at dialogue with the North, Mr. Trump \nthat \xe2\x80\x9ctalking is not the answer!\xe2\x80\x9d\nMs. Haley pressed the Security Council this week to impose an oil ban on North Korea. That\xe2\x80\x99s a likely nonstarter, since it would mostly affect China, which is the North\xe2\x80\x99s primary oil supplier and has long resisted such a ban because it fears it could set off a collapse of the Kim regime, a flood of refugees into China and the reunification of the Korean Peninsula under South Korea. Many experts also doubt the usefulness of sanctions as a tool to force the North to abandon its nuclear weapons, which Pyongyang sees as the only real leverage it has on the global stage.\nMs. Haley\xe2\x80\x99s boss seems no less enamored of the China card, threatening to end trade with China if it does not curtail trade with the North \xe2\x80\x94 a completely empty threat given the powerful economic ties between China and the United States and China\xe2\x80\x99s pivotal role in the global economy. Mr. Trump would be better advised to work with China on a diplomatic initiative that could include the threat of tougher sanctions but would offer the North a deal in which Pyongyang would freeze its nuclear and missile tests in exchange for some American concessions, like a reduction in military exercises.\nIt is not at all clear that Mr. Kim is interested in talking. But Mr. Trump needs to test the possibility before design or miscalculation leads to war.\n'

aS'President Trump didn\xe2\x80\x99t even have the guts to do the job himself. Instead, he hid in the shadows and sent his attorney general, Jeff Sessions, to do the dirty work of telling the country that the administration would no longer shield from deportation 800,000 young undocumented immigrants brought to this country as children.\nMr. Sessions, a longtime anti-immigrant hard-liner, was more than up to the task. In a short, disingenuous speech, he said a program \n \xe2\x80\x94 known as DACA, for Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals \xe2\x80\x94 was a lawless policy that \xe2\x80\x9cyielded terrible humanitarian consequences\xe2\x80\x9d and denied jobs to hundreds of thousands of American citizens. (Mr. Trump echoed these claims in a \n released by the White House.) Mr. Sessions called DACA \xe2\x80\x9can unconstitutional exercise of authority\xe2\x80\x9d and said \xe2\x80\x9cfailure to enforce the laws in the past has put our nation at risk of crime, violence and terrorism.\xe2\x80\x9d\nFalse, false, false and false.\nDACA recipients are not threats to public safety or national security; to the contrary, they must have a nearly spotless record to be eligible in the first place. They do not receive legal status in this country, only a two-year, renewable deferral of deportation along with a work permit and eligibility for other government benefits down the road. And they are not taking jobs from native-born Americans, whose declining levels of employment can be chalked up \n.\nAs for the policy\xe2\x80\x99s legality, there\xe2\x80\x99s no question that the president has the authority to set immigration-enforcement priorities. Presidents of both parties have done that for decades, and President Obama did it by focusing on people with criminal records and not on those brought to this country as children. For most of this latter group, the United States is the only home they\xe2\x80\x99ve ever known. About 9 in 10 are working taxpayers, and deporting them could reduce the gross domestic product \n over the next decade.\nIn short, DACA is morally right, legally sound and fiscally smart policy. It was also the only humane choice Mr. Obama had in the face of Congress\xe2\x80\x99s failure to pass any meaningful immigration reform in the last two decades.\nIf all that weren\xe2\x80\x99t enough, DACA remains overwhelmingly popular among Americans of all political stripes. \n put its approval rating at roughly double that of President Trump himself. Even \n, usually a reliable backer of the Republican legislative agenda, called the decision to end DACA \xe2\x80\x9ccontrary to fundamental American principles.\xe2\x80\x9d\nThe only bad thing that could be said about DACA is that, because it was a presidential memorandum, it was always vulnerable to being undone by a shortsighted administration playing to its base.\nNow that that has happened, 800,000 people \xe2\x80\x94 all of whom gave their personal information and immigration status to the government, believing it would not be used against them \xe2\x80\x94 face the prospect of being shipped back to a country they may have no connection to or even remember.\nThis wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be a concern if Congress had done its job and passed the Dream Act, which would provide a pathway to citizenship for people brought to this country as children, and which has kicked around Capitol Hill for 16 years. Even though it has been stymied mainly by Republican opposition at every turn, it\xe2\x80\x99s still theoretically \n. But there\xe2\x80\x99s little sign the dwindling Republican moderates in Congress have the stomach to confront their party\xe2\x80\x99s nativist core. Mr. Trump called on Congress to act, but didn\xe2\x80\x99t have the courage to tell it what he wanted it to do.\nContrast that with President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s willingness to defend a policy that has always had detractors. \xe2\x80\x9cUltimately, this is about basic decency,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Obama wrote \n on Tuesday. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is about whether we are a people who kick hopeful young strivers out of America, or whether we treat them the way we\xe2\x80\x99d want our own kids to be treated.\xe2\x80\x9d\nMr. Trump has no good rejoinder. That\xe2\x80\x99s partly because there isn\xe2\x80\x99t one and partly because, as is so often the case, \n the scope of what he\xe2\x80\x99s done. One would hope that the widespread outrage at Tuesday\xe2\x80\x99s announcement, and the impending suffering of hundreds of thousands of people who\xe2\x80\x99ve done nothing but try to become contributing members of society, might impress it upon him.\n'

aS'By now, it is a clich\xc3\xa9 to describe The Daily News as the newspaper of New York\xe2\x80\x99s working class. But some clich\xc3\xa9s come to be because they are essentially true. For nearly a century, The News has taken on the world with sleeves-rolled-up sensibilities and New York brass, even amid nose-pressed-against-the glass ogling of celebrities that is a staple of tabloid journalism.\nThe hope here is that the newspaper hangs on to its New York-ness \n, the Chicago-based publisher with a name that sounds straight out of Ogden (\xe2\x80\x9cThe Bronx? No thonx!\xe2\x80\x9d) Nash. Tronc used to be Tribune Publishing. Its present name, a truncation of Tribune online content, reflects an intention to focus more on pixels than on ink-stained wretchedness.\nIn a sense, the purchase represents a reunion for The News. Founded in 1919, it was owned for most of its existence by Tribune, which sold it in 1991 after a bitter strike. The real estate developer and magazine publisher Mortimer Zuckerman bought it in 1993. It gave him a prominent voice in New York civic affairs, beyond what his wealth already provided him. Now that he has given it up at age 80, he may have had his last hurrah as a force in local politics.\nLike most newspapers, The News has struggled in the digital age. It\xe2\x80\x99s easy to forget how it was once a colossus: New York\xe2\x80\x99s picture newspaper, as it used to call itself, unassailable in a tower on Manhattan\xe2\x80\x99s East Side that was the model for The Daily Planet in \xe2\x80\x9cSuperman\xe2\x80\x9d movies. At its peak, in 1947, it had a daily circulation of 2.4 million and nearly twice that on Sundays. Print circulation today has dwindled to the low hundred thousands, and annual losses are believed to be well north of $20 million.\nBut The News still swings for the fences, with jeremiads against political hypocrisy and a renaissance of the sassy front-page headlines that had long been its calling card. In the last two years or so, the \xe2\x80\x9cwood,\xe2\x80\x9d as the headlines on the cover are called in tabloidese, has been conspicuously in-your-face.\nWhen national politicians offered only \xe2\x80\x9cthoughts and prayers\xe2\x80\x9d and nothing about possible gun regulation after the 2015 mass shooting in San Bernardino, Calif., The News\xe2\x80\x99s Page 1 was blunt: \xe2\x80\x9cGod Isn\xe2\x80\x99t Fixing This.\xe2\x80\x9d An NBC interview with the conspiracymonger Alex Jones inspired \xe2\x80\x9cNutwork News.\xe2\x80\x9d New York City Hall\xe2\x80\x99s shrug at pay-to-play allegations led to \xe2\x80\x9cCase of de Blahs.\xe2\x80\x9d\nAnd in 2016 Donald Trump landed on the front page more than once covered in clown makeup. He\xe2\x80\x99s lost the Bozo look as president but not the contumely. The News greeted his withdrawal from the Paris climate accord with \xe2\x80\x9c\n.\xe2\x80\x9d\nAs engaged newspaper readers know, that headline paid homage to a News classic from 1975 when it looked as if Washington would let the city fall into bankruptcy: \xe2\x80\x9c\n.\xe2\x80\x9d The newspaper couldn\xe2\x80\x99t refrain from invoking it as well in January 2016 when Senator Ted Cruz sneered at what he called \xe2\x80\x9cNew York values.\xe2\x80\x9d Accompanying an illustration of the Statue of Liberty giving a one-finger salute, the wood was \xe2\x80\x9cDrop Dead, Ted.\xe2\x80\x9d\nFeeling our own way in the digital world, we can only wish that brashness remains one New York value that Tronc retains.

aS' Democratic lawmakers are probing whether retired U.S. General Michael Flynn secretly promoted a U.S.-Russian project to build dozens of nuclear reactors in the Middle East after becoming President Donald Trump\xe2\x80\x99s first national security adviser. \nRepresentatives Elijah Cummings and Eliot Engel made the disclosure in a letter they sent on Tuesday to Flynn\xe2\x80\x99s lawyer and executives of firms that developed the reactor scheme and for which Flynn\xe2\x80\x99s now-defunct consulting company worked. \n\xe2\x80\x9cThe American people deserve to know whether General Flynn was secretly promoting the private interests of these businesses while he was a (Trump) campaign adviser, transition official, or President Trump\xe2\x80\x99s national security adviser,\xe2\x80\x9d the two said in the letter made public on Wednesday. \nThey asked Flynn\xe2\x80\x99s lawyer and executives of companies involved in the project to provide \xe2\x80\x9call communications\xe2\x80\x9d they had with Flynn or other administration officials during the 2016 campaign, the post-election transition or Flynn\xe2\x80\x99s tenure as national security adviser. \nRobert Kelner, Flynn\xe2\x80\x99s lawyer, declined to comment. \nThe project proposes to construct 40 nuclear reactors across the Middle East that would feed a regional electric grid. The reactors would be \xe2\x80\x9cproliferation proof,\xe2\x80\x9d meaning they could not be used to produce fuel for nuclear weapons. \nCummings, the top Democrat on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, and Engel, the senior Democrat on the House Foreign Relations Committee, asked that the documents be provided by Oct. 4. \n\xe2\x80\x98SIGNIFICANT QUESTIONS\xe2\x80\x99 \nFlynn is a central figure in a federal probe led by Special Counsel Robert Mueller, a former FBI director, into whether Trump aides colluded in an alleged Russian effort to boost Trump\xe2\x80\x99s presidential campaign. Russia has denied interfering in the U.S. election and Trump has said there was no collusion. \nTrump, who took office on Jan. 20, fired Flynn on Feb. 13, 18 days after a top Justice Department official warned that the former Defense Intelligence Agency director could be blackmailed because Moscow knew he made misleading statements about his contacts with Russian officials. \nCummings and Engel sent their letter as part of an inquiry into the renewal of Flynn\xe2\x80\x99s 2016 Top Secret security clearance. \nThey said Flynn failed to disclose a June 2015 trip he made to Egypt and Israel to promote the reactor project to investigators reviewing his renewal application and that he also did not list the foreigners with whom he met. \nThe lawmakers wrote that replies from the executives and Kelner to a June letter confirmed that Flynn made the trip. \n\xe2\x80\x9cBased on your responses, it appears that General Flynn violated federal law,\xe2\x80\x9d they wrote. \n\xe2\x80\x9cSince these violations carry criminal penalties of up to five years in prison, we are providing your responses to Special Counsel Robert Mueller,\xe2\x80\x9d they wrote to Kelner, Alex G. Copson of X-Co Dynamics/ACU Strategic Partners, and retired Rear Admiral Michael Hewitt of X-Co Dynamics/Ironbridge Group/IP3. All are private companies. \n\xe2\x80\x9cSecond, your responses raise significant questions about whether General Flynn continued to communicate with you and others about this project after the presidential election, after Donald Trump was sworn in as president, and after General Flynn assumed the post of national security adviser - without disclosing his foreign travel or contacts,\xe2\x80\x9d the lawmakers added. \nDonald Gross, counsel for ACU Strategic Partners, said the company has cooperated with the oversight committee in providing information about the project being developed along with Hewitt\xe2\x80\x99s IP3, and \xe2\x80\x9cGeneral Flynn\xe2\x80\x99s limited involvement in June 2015.\xe2\x80\x9d \nHewitt did not respond to a LinkedIn message seeking comment. \nThe proposed reactor project would be funded by Saudi Arabia and other Gulf Arab states and built and run by a consortium of U.S., Russian, French, Dutch, Arab, British, Ukrainian and Israeli firms. A promotional slide promoting the project said security would be provided by Rosoboron, a Russian state-owned arms exporter that is under U.S. sanctions.  \n'

aS' The U.S. Congress passed a resolution late on Tuesday calling on President Donald Trump to condemn hate groups after Trump was criticized for his response to the violence at a white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, a month ago. \nThe U.S. House of Representatives unanimously adopted the resolution, U.S. Representative Gerry Connolly, a Democrat from Virginia, said in a statement. The Senate approved the measure on Monday. \n\xe2\x80\x9cTonight, the House of Representatives spoke in one unified voice to unequivocally condemn the shameful and hate-filled acts of violence carried out by the KKK (Ku Klux Klan), white nationalists, white supremacists and neo-Nazis in Charlottesville,\xe2\x80\x9d Connolly said. \nThe joint resolution, passed with the support of both Republicans and Democrats, will go to Trump for his signature.  \nRepresentatives for the White House did not respond immediately to an email seeking comment. \nThe Congressional resolution calls on Trump to condemn hate groups and what it describes as the growing prevalence of extremists who support anti-Semitism, xenophobia and white supremacy. \nIt also urges Attorney General Jeff Sessions to investigate acts of violence and intimidation by white nationalists, neo-Nazis, the Ku Klux Klan and similar groups. \nTrump alienated fellow Republicans, corporate leaders and U.S. allies and rattled markets last month with comments about the violence in Charlottesville, where white nationalists and neo-Nazis clashed with anti-racism activists on Aug. 12. \nOne woman, Heather Heyer, was killed and several people were wounded when a suspected white nationalist crashed his car into anti-racist demonstrators. \nThe Congressional resolution calls Heyer\xe2\x80\x99s death a \xe2\x80\x9cdomestic terrorist attack.\xe2\x80\x9d James Alex Fields, a 20-year-old Ohio man who authorities say drove into Heyer and other protesters, has been charged with second-degree murder and other criminal counts.  \nOn Aug. 12, Trump denounced hatred and violence \xe2\x80\x9con many sides,\xe2\x80\x9d a comment that drew sharp criticism from across the political spectrum for not condemning white nationalists.  \nWhite nationalists had gathered in Charlottesville to protest against the planned removal of a statue of Robert E. Lee, who led the pro-slavery Confederacy\xe2\x80\x99s army during the U.S. Civil War. Trump defended Confederate monuments last month. \nAt a rally in Phoenix on Aug. 22, Trump accused television networks of ignoring his calls for unity in the aftermath of the violence in Charlottesville. \n\xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t say I love you because you\xe2\x80\x99re black, or I love you because you\xe2\x80\x99re white,\xe2\x80\x9d Trump said at the rally. \xe2\x80\x9cI love all the people of our country.\xe2\x80\x9d \nThe resolution also acknowledged the deaths of two Virginia State Police officers whose helicopter crashed as they patrolled the Charlottesville protest. \n'

Beijing and Pyongyang have long been allies, and China is North Korea\xe2\x80\x99s main trade partner. But for a host of strategic reasons, there are inherent limits to what Beijing will do. It is wary of the fallout it would suffer if North Korea imploded, and it wants to preserve a buffer between itself and the United States forces based in South Korea.\nRussia is both like and unlike China in just the ways that could make it an effective broker with Pyongyang.\nLike China, Russia is a nuclear power, a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council and a neighbor of North Korea with established lines of communication to Pyongyang. During World War II, Kim Il-sung (Kim Jong-un\xe2\x80\x99s grandfather) served as \n; Kim Jong-il (Kim Jong-un\xe2\x80\x99s father) \n several times in the early 2000s. President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia himself went to Pyongyang in 2000. Although he failed to work out a deal to limit North Korea\xe2\x80\x99s missile program at the time, his visit helped restore links with Pyongyang, which had been neglected after the fall of the Soviet Union.\nRussia is not among the countries most directly or most intimately affected by North Korea\xe2\x80\x99s nuclear ambitions, such as the United States, South Korea or China. And unlike China, Russia never was an imperial overlord on the Korean Peninsula. Moscow may have less direct influence with Pyongyang than does Beijing, but it evokes far less nationalistic resentment and suspicion among North Koreans.\nRussia also has a clear and immediate interest in helping de-escalate the current crisis. Vladivostok, its gateway to the Asia-Pacific region, the headquarters of its Pacific Fleet and a hub for its energy trade, is just a couple hundred miles away from several of North Korea\xe2\x80\x99s nuclear and missile sites. Any malfunction or other mishap with North Korea\xe2\x80\x99s nuclear tests or missile launches could mean contamination in Russia itself. The Russian government is also eager to curb the further deployment of American missile-defense systems in South Korea and Japan, which both those countries are pursuing to protect themselves against North Korea.\nNorth Korea will not denuclearize; it\xe2\x80\x99s too late for that. Neither will it ever formally be recognized as a nuclear power. But it will eventually have crude nuclear weapons with which to strike United States territory.\nSanctions, no matter how strict, will not stop Pyongyang from pursuing its program, which it sees as the key to its very survival; as Mr. Putin said recently, North Koreans will \xe2\x80\x9c\n\xe2\x80\x9d before they give up nuclear weapons. Pyongyang\xe2\x80\x99s \n was a direct rebuke to the new sanctions, notably on oil imports, that the U.N. Security Council passed last Monday.\nThis is not to say that sanctions are a mistake. They remain a valuable expression of collective condemnation and reassert the goal of nuclear nonproliferation. But they will not halt North Korea\xe2\x80\x99s nuclearization.\nA total blockade of the country might, but it is too risky to even attempt. It could push North Korea to start a war or cause the country\xe2\x80\x99s collapse, a prospect that China, for one, cannot tolerate.\nAnd so the only viable strategy left is to convince the North Korean leadership that it already has the deterrent it needs, and that going beyond that \xe2\x80\x94 by developing more nuclear weapons and longer-range missiles \xe2\x80\x94 would only be counterproductive.\nThis is where Russia comes it: It can help nudge Pyongyang toward strategic restraint, and help defuse tensions in the meantime, by offering it new economic prospects.\nOne project that has been discussed in the past involves building \n from Russia to South Korea through North Korea. Another would be to restore an old rail link that used to connect South Korea to the Tran-Siberian. Both would generate transit fees, in foreign currency, for Pyongyang. As another expression of good will, the Russian government could also authorize more North Koreans \n: An estimated 30,000 to 50,000 already do, many as construction workers and laborers.\nThe North Korean economy is \n than is commonly thought. Its gross domestic product has grown recently \xe2\x80\x94 by \n between 2016 and 2017 \xe2\x80\x94 and market forces are emerging, for the trade of food and real estate, for example. That means not only that North Korea may be better able to withstand sanctions today than it was in the past, but also that economic overtures could hurry its transformation along \xe2\x80\x94 and perhaps in time soften its stance internationally.\nWashington and Pyongyang will eventually need to resume direct talks. With neither party ready for that yet, at first secret contacts will have to be organized in third countries. In the meantime, de-escalation is the order of the day, and Russia one of its unlikely brokers.\n'

aS'As the daughter of a father from Crete (and of a Cuban-born mother), \n may be familiar with the Greek myth of Sisyphus, doomed for eternity to push a boulder up a hill, only to have it roll back on him every time. Running as a Republican for citywide office in New York is kind of like that \xe2\x80\x94 only maybe more frustrating.\nTrue, two recent mayors ran successfully as Republicans, Rudolph Giuliani and Michael Bloomberg, but the former had broad name recognition from the start, and the latter had tons of money.\nMs. Malliotakis, a young Republican member of the State Assembly from Staten Island\xe2\x80\x99s eastern shore whose district extends into southern Brooklyn, has neither of those advantages in her campaign to displace Bill de Blasio at City Hall. But she has guts. She also has the Republican and Conservative mayoral lines all to herself, so she has been able to concentrate her fire on the Democratic incumbent.\nStaten Island is the only borough in the city that Donald Trump won in 2016, and Ms. Malliotakis says she voted for him. But she now seeks to put daylight between the president and herself and asks to be judged on her merits, which include seven years in the Assembly. In her view, Mr. de Blasio has presided over a deteriorated quality of life, a mass transit system in shambles and an unacceptable municipal policy that protects undocumented immigrants convicted of serious crimes.\nWhether her message can resonate across the heavily Democratic city is a question. But we\xe2\x80\x99re pleased that she is prepared to give her Democratic opponent a lively challenge.\nWhat\xe2\x80\x99s not clear is if she will raise enough money to qualify for city matching funds and for a place in a debate against Mr. de Blasio, assuming he wins his party\xe2\x80\x99s nomination. Should she fall short, we\xe2\x80\x99d encourage the mayor to debate her anyway. The city would be the better for it.\n'

aS'Jimmy Morales was elected president of Guatemala in 2015 on a promise of stopping the country\xe2\x80\x99s fabled corruption and restoring conservative values. A former television personality widely known for his comic role in the series Moralejas (Morals), Mr. Morales rode popular anger to victory in 2015 as an outsider whose slogan was \xe2\x80\x9cnot corrupt, nor a thief.\xe2\x80\x9d\nBut on Aug. 27, when a United Nations-backed anticorruption unit began getting uncomfortably close to him and his supporters, Mr. Morales \n. Guatemala\xe2\x80\x99s top court \n the order, but the nation still faces a crisis.\nMr. Morales acted out of desperation. Iv\xc3\xa1n Vel\xc3\xa1squez, the respected Colombian prosecutor who heads the unit, the International Commission against Impunity in Guatemala, and the Guatemalan attorney general, Thelma Aldana, had already jailed Morales\xe2\x80\x99s older brother and son. On Aug. 25 they announced they were seeking to strip the president himself of his constitutional immunity in a probe of fishy campaign contributions.\nThe International Commission against Impunity in Guatemala was formed in 2006 at the request of human-rights activists and Guatemalan officials, backed by the United States and other governments, to help Guatemalan prosecutors combat a blight of organized crime and corruption. Much of that has seeped out of criminal networks formed by veterans of the Guatemalan Army that ravaged the country in its long civil war and who then turned the nation into what Amnesty International \n \xe2\x80\x9cCorporate Mafia State.\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Morales, a social conservative and nationalist, was backed by the National Convergence Front, a party formed by hard-line retired army officers, whose finances are now under investigation.\nPublic fury over revelations of impunity on high overflowed into a protest movement in 2015, forcing the man then president and his vice president to step down. Both are in jail awaiting trial \xe2\x80\x94 the fate Mr. Morales is trying to avoid.\nThe United States, which supported the Guatemalan military during the brutal civil war and is the main political and financial backer of the international commission, should take the leading role, alongside the United Nations, in ensuring that Mr. Morales backs down and lets the investigation lead where it must.\nThe State Department and the United States ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki Haley, were right to \nMr. Morales\xe2\x80\x99s attempt to expel Mr. Vel\xc3\xa1squez. The United Nations secretary general, Ant\xc3\xb3nio Guterres, made clear that \n \xe2\x80\x9cshocked\xe2\x80\x9d by Mr. Morales\xe2\x80\x99s action.\nGuatemala cannot afford to backslide, and Washington must help it stay the course.\n'

aS'The wrenching shift in the Justice Department\xe2\x80\x99s approach to criminal justice under President Trump is playing out painfully as Chicago tries to rein in a scandalous police culture that tolerated officers routinely abusing and killing residents, particularly African-Americans and Latinos.\nTwo developments last week underlined the need for the firm federal oversight of police misconduct from which Attorney General Jeff Sessions had retreated.\nIn the first, a federal jury handed down a rare criminal conviction of a Chicago policeman. The officer, Marco Proano, was found guilty of using excessive force in violating the civil rights of six black teenagers chased down in a stolen car. He fired 16 shots at them in nine seconds, wounding two as they cowered in the car. A police video was crucial to the conviction, which critics say might have never have happened in city courts, long accused of protecting the police.\nIn the second, the \n, stepped forward and filed an unusual federal lawsuit against Chicago seeking a court-enforced consent decree to reform police training and oversight. The state\xe2\x80\x99s lawsuit would do what the Trump administration had backed away from \xe2\x80\x94 court-enforced controls on the police that the Obama administration engineered through consent decrees in troubled communities from Ferguson, Mo., to Cleveland.\nIn the Obama administration\xe2\x80\x99s waning days, the city agreed to seek a court decree with federal officials. But once Mr. Sessions became attorney general, he spoke skeptically of consent decrees and staunchly defended the police. With Mr. Trump in office, Mayor Rahm Emanuel shifted, insisting the city could achieve reform on its own, overseen by a monitor, not a federal judge.\nIn July, Ms. Madigan wisely \n the idea that any reform would be possible without the muscle of court enforcement. When she announced last week that the state had to act, the mayor was at her side, presumably back on the side of effective reform.\nMs. Madigan asserted that she was compelled to act \xe2\x80\x9cin the absence of a committed Justice Department.\xe2\x80\x9d The goal, she said, is to repair the \xe2\x80\x9cbroken trust\xe2\x80\x9d between the city and black and Hispanic Chicagoans by enforcing \xe2\x80\x9csafe and constitutional police practices.\xe2\x80\x9d\nThe need for overhauling the Chicago force was documented last January in a \n after a yearlong study by Justice investigators that detailed cases of abuse in \xe2\x80\x9ca culture in which officers expect to use force and not be questioned about the need for or propriety of that use.\xe2\x80\x9d\nThe Justice Department has reacted with simplistic echoes of the Trump campaign theme about \xe2\x80\x9crampant" crime and the need for \xe2\x80\x9cproactive policing\xe2\x80\x9d in Chicago. Unfortunately, it did not point to the federal government\xe2\x80\x99s obvious responsibility to help the city protect civil rights.\n'

aS'We are not going to dwell on Melania Trump\xe2\x80\x99s flying to flood-ravaged Texas in stilettos, or sneakers, here. But nature abhors a vacuum, and the first lady\xe2\x80\x99s fans and critics focus on her costumes in part because, so far, that\xe2\x80\x99s about all they see of Melania Trump. In the back-to-work spirit of Labor Day, let\xe2\x80\x99s reflect on Mrs. Trump\xe2\x80\x99s plans as first lady now that she\xe2\x80\x99s settled in the White House and Barron, her only child, heads back to school.\nAmerican first ladies occupy an unpaid job in the middle of a political minefield. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re reflecting not only on yourself and the administration; you\xe2\x80\x99re in a way seen as representative of all women,\xe2\x80\x9d says Lisa Kathleen Graddy, curator of American political history and women\xe2\x80\x99s political history at the Smithsonian\xe2\x80\x99s National Museum of American History. Americans expect their first ladies to be \xe2\x80\x9call things at all times: graceful, courteous, considerate, compassionate, diplomatic \xe2\x80\x94 but in an acceptable kind of way, not overblown, or hectoring. \xe2\x80\xa6 There are no written rules. You find those lines only when you cross them.\xe2\x80\x9d\nMrs. Trump\xe2\x80\x99s added burden is that besides helping to change the world, she has been expected to help change her husband. We\xe2\x80\x99ll get back to that.\nBorn in Slovenia, Melania Trump is the first foreign-born first lady to occupy the White House since Louisa Adams, the London-born wife of John Quincy Adams, who became first lady in 1825. Some first ladies use their perch to continue work they have already been interested in, as when Eleanor Roosevelt turned her longtime passion for politics into advocacy for human rights and a post-White House diplomatic career.\nMrs. Trump hasn\xe2\x80\x99t had much in the way of traditional job preparation, which puts her on par with most people in this inexperienced White House. Her previous jobs as a fashion model and QVC jewelry entrepreneur don\xe2\x80\x99t readily translate. Her interest in fashion contributed to last week\xe2\x80\x99s contretemps over her shoes. And her lawyers\xe2\x80\x99 reference, in two successful libel suits against \n, to the potential for her to start \xe2\x80\x9ca broad-based commercial brand in multiple product categories\xe2\x80\x9d while in the White House, reinforced the widely held belief that the Trumps see the presidency as a merchandising opportunity.\nStephanie Grisham, Mrs. Trump\xe2\x80\x99s spokeswoman, says that the first lady will announce her initiatives in her own good time, and that her devotion as a mother \xe2\x80\x94 she is essentially a single parent to 11-year-old Barron \xe2\x80\x94 provides hints of her next move. So, too, does her participation in a panel on opioid abuse this summer. \xe2\x80\x9cSept. is Nat\xe2\x80\x99l Alcohol&Drug Addiction Recovery Month. Together we can strengthen families&communities & beat addiction,\xe2\x80\x9d she \n on Friday.\nWhile her husband\xe2\x80\x99s Twitter account is a toxic dump, Mrs. Trump\xe2\x80\x99s is a pristine model of offered thanks, prayers, support for children and support for victims of disaster. After the neo-Nazi violence in Charlottesville, Va., she \n: \xe2\x80\x9cOur country encourages freedom of speech, but let\xe2\x80\x99s communicate w/o hate in our hearts. No good comes from violence. \n.\xe2\x80\x9d\nAs Hillary Clinton and Michelle Obama did with their children, Mrs. Trump is determined to shield Barron from a prying public. She has made her share of hospital and classroom visits, and in photographs she appears happier in the company of children \n of \xe2\x80\xa6 you know, the guy she \n to as, \xe2\x80\x9cSometimes I say I have two teenage boys at home.\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Trump has kept Mrs. Obama\xe2\x80\x99s garden because, as Ms. Grisham says, she knows Mrs. Obama loved it, and she appreciates its role in teaching kids to make healthy choices.\nWhich brings us to Mr. Trump, whose social media choices need work. After saying that combating cyberbullying is something she\xe2\x80\x99d like to work on, Mrs. Trump has made no headway in reforming the cyberbully in chief. She was criticized for seeming to defend her husband\xe2\x80\x99s grotesque \n assault on the television journalist Mika Brzezinski, when Ms. Grisham \n that \xe2\x80\x9cas the first lady has stated publicly in the past, when her husband gets attacked, he will punch back 10 times harder.\xe2\x80\x9d Ms. Grisham took responsibility for that one, saying it was a comment of Mrs. Trump\xe2\x80\x99s from the past, and \xe2\x80\x9cout of context.\xe2\x80\x9d\nFive-inch heels may not be enough to elevate Mrs. Trump from the muck flowing through this White House. But as we search every corner for people who are growing in the job, let\xe2\x80\x99s hope the first lady will provide the grace and normality that has been so lacking. But if she does, will Mr. Trump tolerate a wife who\xe2\x80\x99s more popular than he is?\n'

aS'As they return to Washington this week from their August recess, House Republicans on the Ways and Means Committee have their work cut out for them. Their job is to draft a major tax-cut bill for Congress to pass, ideally by year-end, to avoid closing out 2017 without a single big legislative win. The policy objective is to steeply cut tax rates for businesses and wealthy individuals. The political aim, and the point of \n last Wednesday, is to persuade the men and women in the Trump working-class base that a tax cut for the wealthy would be good for them, too.\nIt would not be, and to pretend otherwise, as Mr. Trump did, is to substitute propaganda for discourse. Mr. Trump\xe2\x80\x99s claim that tax cuts will propel economic growth and lift wages ignores the \nof economists, which is that multitrillion-dollar tax cuts, as envisioned by Mr. Trump, are not a stable or reliable way to do either.\nThe president\xe2\x80\x99s claim also defies history. Wages have long stagnated, despite tax cuts in the 1980s and 2000s, while profits, shareholder returns and executive pay have soared. Profits, whether lifted by favorable economic conditions, by tax cuts or by both, have not translated into employee raises and have instead been used for other purposes. One is to buy back stock, which lifts share prices and, by extension, executive compensation. Following a huge one-off corporate tax cut in 2004, big piles of corporate cash were also used to pay dividends to shareholders, settle legal issues and finance severance packages for layoffs.\nOf all the ways that corporations have spent their profits recently, business investment has generally been low on the list. \n, if they make the list at all. It would be foolish to expect anything different if a new set of tax cuts increased corporations\xe2\x80\x99 already healthy profits. Any advantages for middle-class Americans would amount to crumbs from the banquet table.\nThen, too, there is the budget issue. Mr. Trump has proposed cutting the top corporate rate from 35 percent to 15 percent, a point he emphasized on Wednesday despite warnings from his economic advisers that a cut that sizable would cause the deficit to explode. Separately, he and his advisers have also proposed ending taxation on the foreign profits of American corporations, even though such profits are often actually earned in the United States and simply relabeled as foreign through the use of complex accounting maneuvers.\nProposed tax breaks for working people, in contrast, include relatively modest reductions in tax rates, a more generous standard deduction and tax relief for child care expenses. A \n of Mr. Trump\xe2\x80\x99s proposals by the nonpartisan Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center generously assumed that policy makers would end popular write-offs, including the deduction for state taxes, to offset the cost of the cuts. Even then, the analysis showed that the proposed Trump tax cuts would lift after-tax income for the top 1 percent of taxpayers by at least 11.5 percent (or an average annual tax cut of $175,000), compared with a barely perceptible 1.3 percent for taxpayers in the middle (or $760 in average tax savings).\nOver all, the cuts, paired with loophole closers, would cost at least $3.4 trillion in revenue in the first 10 years and $5.9 trillion over the following decade. The question is how House Republicans will deal with those potential deficits. Many of them have built their reputations as fiscal hawks. Even if they were inclined to set aside their professed aversion to deficits to pass a big tax cut, their scope for deficit financing has now been narrowed by the floods in Houston, which will force them to borrow and spend for relief and recovery efforts. That is a responsible thing to do in an emergency. Borrowing to cut taxes \xe2\x80\x94 akin to taking cash advances on a credit card \xe2\x80\x94 is not responsible, in good times or bad.\nThe fixation on tax cuts is regrettable, because corporate tax reform is a worthy goal. Done right, it would lower the top corporate tax rate to 25 percent or so, bringing it more in line with the rates of other developed nations. It would also raise revenue by eliminating special-interest loopholes and enacting a small per-trade tax on financial transactions to account for the growth of financial markets in the nation\xe2\x80\x99s economy. As yet, there is no sign that Republicans are prepared to take that sensible path.\n'

aS'Since his spectacular victory in France\xe2\x80\x99s presidential race in May on a promise of a new kind of politics, Emmanuel Macron has had a rocky ride. The \n of staff quit in anger over budget cuts; the president endured ridicule over how much he spent \n; he has been accused of being aloof; his \n have plummeted. All that, however, is just a prelude to the real battle.\nThat began Thursday, when the government unveiled the centerpiece of Mr. Macron\xe2\x80\x99s plan to \n: an overhaul of the infamously cumbersome, obtuse and harmful labor rules, the 3,324-page \n. Whatever Mr. Macron\xe2\x80\x99s woes up to now \xe2\x80\x94 and many of them stem from anticipation of the changes \xe2\x80\x94 the success or failure of his effort to loosen the code could well determine the success or failure of his presidency.\nThe overhaul came in the form of five decrees, a constitutional device the Macron-dominated Parliament empowered the president to use to streamline the process. And that is just the beginning. The government\xe2\x80\x99s plan to reform the French social and economic system is expected to encompass reduced spending and changes to pension and unemployment programs, which could be even more contentious.\nBut the labor code has a special place in France. Its roots go back to efforts in the Napoleonic era to restore order after the French Revolution, and at its heart is the notion of the worker in permanent need of protection against rapacious capitalists. Every effort at fundamental reform for at least a quarter of a century has foundered on giant and sometimes violent union demonstrations.\nTo the code\xe2\x80\x99s critics, its elaborate protections of workers\xe2\x80\x99 rights, including the high cost of hiring and the even higher cost of firing, have been major obstacles to growth and foreign investment, and a primary reason for an unemployment rate that hovers stubbornly around 10 percent. The reforms would, among other things, make it easier for employers to hire and fire workers, and allow employers in some instances to negotiate with workers at the company level instead of following industrywide agreements.\nPublic opinion polls \xe2\x80\x94 and Mr. Macron\xe2\x80\x99s election \xe2\x80\x94 show that the French broadly recognize the need for change. The government has wisely paved the way with talks held over the summer with labor unions, and the more moderate unions have said they will not oppose the reforms. Others, like the General Confederation of Labor (C.G.T.), the second-largest national union, have declared their opposition. Philippe Martinez, the head of the C.G.T., calls the reforms \xe2\x80\x9cold recipes\xe2\x80\x9d that do not work and has said, \xe2\x80\x9cAll studies show that there is no relationship between collective rights and the fight against unemployment.\xe2\x80\x9d The C.G.T. has called a one-day strike for Sept. 12.\nThe knocks Mr. Macron has taken in his first months may have taught him the value of being more accessible and less concerned with his appearance, but his woes should not be exaggerated. He was elected on a platform of rescuing France from years of anemic growth, high unemployment and budget deficits. His success is critical for the French and for the European Union, in which France plays a leading role alongside Germany. Mr. Macron and his government have set off on the right track with the labor reform, and they must stay the course.\n'

aS' Florida allowed some residents to return on Tuesday to areas  hammered by Hurricane Irma\xe2\x80\x99s high winds and storm surge, while  the death toll rose in the second major hurricane to hit the United States this year. \nIrma, which had rampaged through the Caribbean as one of the most powerful Atlantic hurricanes on record, was downgraded to a tropical depression on Monday. It will likely dissipate from Tuesday evening, the National Hurricane Center said. \nAt its peak the storm prompted evacuation orders for 6.5 million people in Florida, the largest evacuation in modern U.S. history. \nIrma killed nearly 40 people in the Caribbean and at least six in Florida and Georgia. \nA local Florida official said there had been more deaths yet to be reported, particularly on the Florida Keys, where Irma arrived as a Category 4 hurricane with sustained winds of up to 130 miles per hour (215 km per hour) on Sunday morning.  \nLocal authorities told around 90,000 residents of Miami Beach and from some parts of the Keys they could go home but warned it might not be prudent to remain there. \n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is going to be a frustrating event. It\xe2\x80\x99s going to take some time to let people back into their homes particularly in the Florida Keys,\xe2\x80\x9d Brock Long, administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, told a news conference. \nFEMA was continuing to rescue people stranded by flooding around Jacksonville, in the state\xe2\x80\x99s northeast, he said. \nIrma devastated several Caribbean islands en route to Florida. It destroyed about one-third of the buildings on the Dutch-ruled portion of St. Martin island, the Dutch Red Cross said on Tuesday. \nThe storm was the second major hurricane to make landfall in the United States in a little more than two weeks when it roared over Key Cudjoe. Hurricane Harvey plowed into Houston late last month, killing about 60 and wreaking some $180 billion in damage, largely through flooding. \nMonroe County Commissioner Heather Carruthers said on Monday that people had been killed in the Keys, which have nearly 80,000 permanent residents, but she did not have a count on how many.  \n\xe2\x80\x9cWe are finding some remains,\xe2\x80\x9d she said in an interview with CNN. Video footage of the islands showed homes torn apart. \nSeveral major airports in Florida that halted passenger operations due to Irma began limited service on Tuesday, including Miami International, one of the busiest U.S. airports. \nMiami Beach will allow residents to return home from 8 a.m. (1200 GMT), its mayor said. More evacuation orders were likely to be lifted on Tuesday. \nMonroe County opened road access on Tuesday morning for residents and business owners from Key Largo, the main island at the upper end of the chain, as well as the towns of Tavernier and Islamorada farther to the south, fire officials said. \nNo timetable was given for reopening the remainder of the Keys, which are linked by a series of causeways and bridges down to Key West, a popular tourist spot on the southern tip of Florida. \nUtilities reported some 6.9 million homes and businesses were without electricity in Florida and neighboring states and said it could take weeks to fully restore service. \nBetween 2,000 and 3,000 utility workers from out of state, sent to inspect and repair power lines, were staying in Broward County in cramped conditions at BB&T Center, home to the National Hockey League\xe2\x80\x99s Florida Panthers, said Gus Beyersdorf, 40, of De Pere, Wisconsin. \nInsured property losses in Florida from Irma were expected to run from $20 billion to $40 billion, catastrophe modeling firm AIR Worldwide estimated. \nOne man was found dead in his crashed car on the Keys and  two law enforcement officers died in a possibly storm-related fatal car crash on Sunday in Orange County, Florida. On Monday, two people were killed by falling trees in two Atlanta suburbs, according to local authorities. \nA man was found dead in Winter Garden, Florida, after being electrocuted by a downed power line, local police said. \nThe remnants of Irma moved into Alabama on Tuesday and were forecast to head into western Tennessee by Tuesday evening with maximum sustained winds of 25 mph (40 kph). \nIn South Carolina, the Charleston Harbor area saw major flooding on Monday with water about 3 feet (1 meter) above flood stage and minor flooding was forecast for Tuesday, the National Weather Service said. \nThe National Hurricane Center was monitoring another hurricane, Jose, which was spinning in the Atlantic about 700 miles (1,130 km) west of Florida. About 2-1/2 months remain in the Atlantic hurricane season, which starts in June. \n'

aS' U.S. Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy on Monday provided a temporary reprieve for President Trump\xe2\x80\x99s order blocking most refugees from entering the United States, putting on hold a lower court\xe2\x80\x99s ruling loosening the prohibition. \nKennedy\xe2\x80\x99s action gave the nine justices more time to consider the Justice Department\xe2\x80\x99s challenge filed on Monday to the lower court\xe2\x80\x99s decision allowing entry to refugees from around the world if they had a formal offer from a resettlement agency. The full Supreme Court could act within days. \nThe Justice Department opted not to appeal another part of last Thursday\xe2\x80\x99s ruling by the San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals that related to Trump\xe2\x80\x99s ban on travelers from six Muslim-majority nations. The 9th Circuit ruling broadened the number of people with exemptions to the ban to include grandparents, aunts, uncles and cousins of legal U.S. residents. \nWithout Kennedy\xe2\x80\x99s intervention, the appeals court decision would have gone into effect on Tuesday. Kennedy asked refugee ban challengers to file a response to the Trump administration\xe2\x80\x99s filing by noon on Tuesday. \nUnder the 9th U.S. Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s ruling, up to 24,000 additional refugees would become eligible to enter the United States than otherwise would be allowed, according to the administration. \nTrump\xe2\x80\x99s March 6 order banned travelers from Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen for 90 days and locked out most aspiring refugees for 120 days in a move the Republican president argued was needed to prevent terrorist attacks. \nThe order, which replaced a broader January one that was blocked by federal courts, was one of the most contentious acts of his presidency. Critics called it an unlawful \xe2\x80\x9cMuslim ban\xe2\x80\x9d that made good on Trump\xe2\x80\x99s promise as a candidate of \xe2\x80\x9ca total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States.\xe2\x80\x9d \nThe broader question of whether the travel ban discriminates against Muslims in violation of the U.S. Constitution, as lower courts previously ruled, will be argued before the Supreme Court on Oct. 10. \nThe Supreme Court in June partially revived the order after its provisions were blocked by lower courts. But the justices said a ban could be applied only to those without a \xe2\x80\x9cbona fide\xe2\x80\x9d relationship to people or entities in the United States. \nNew litigation was brought by Hawaii over the meaning of that phrase, including whether written assurances by resettlement agencies obligating them to provide services for specific refugees would count. \nHawaii and other Democratic-led states, the American Civil Liberties Union and refugee groups filed legal challenges after Trump signed his order in March. \n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Trump administration has ended its odd and ill-advised quest to ban grandmas from the country,\xe2\x80\x9d Hawaii Attorney General Douglas Chin said on Monday. \n\xe2\x80\x9cWith respect to the admission to the United States of refugees with formal assurances and the Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s temporary stay order, each day matters,\xe2\x80\x9d Chin added, promising to respond soon to the administration\xe2\x80\x99s filing. \nIn court papers filed earlier on Monday, the Justice Department said the 9th Circuit refugees decision \xe2\x80\x9cwill disrupt the status quo and frustrate orderly implementation of the order\xe2\x80\x99s refugee provisions.\xe2\x80\x9d \nOmar Jadwat, an ACLU lawyer, contrasted Trump\xe2\x80\x99s efforts to keep alive his travel ban with the Republican president\xe2\x80\x99s decision last week to rescind a program that protected from deportation people brought to the United States illegally as children, dubbed \xe2\x80\x9cDreamers.\xe2\x80\x9d \n\xe2\x80\x9cThe extraordinary efforts the administration is taking in pursuit of the Muslim ban stand in stark contrast to its unwillingness to take a single step to protect 800,000 Dreamers,\xe2\x80\x9d Jadwat said. \n'

aS' Republican lawmaker Devin Nunes\xe2\x80\x99 investigation into whether Obama administration officials used classified intelligence reports to discredit Donald Trump\xe2\x80\x99s 2016 campaign team could backfire on the congressman - and the president, sources familiar with the reports said. \nThe reports contain no evidence that any aides to former Democratic President Barack Obama acted improperly, the sources said, but they do indicate some Trump associates may have violated an obscure 1799 law, the Logan Act, which prohibits unauthorized U.S. citizens from negotiating with a foreign government that has a dispute with the United States. \nThe spying reports also are relevant to the investigation by special counsel Robert Mueller into conclusions by U.S. intelligence agencies that Russia worked to tilt last November\xe2\x80\x99s election in Republican Trump\xe2\x80\x99s favor, said the sources, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. \nMueller\xe2\x80\x99s office declined to comment. \nRussia, under U.S. sanctions for rights abuses and its 2014 annexation of Crimea, has repeatedly denied allegations of election meddling. Trump has denied any possible collusion between his campaign and Moscow, an issue that has loomed over the new presidency. \nNunes, chairman of the U.S. House Intelligence Committee and a Trump ally, met secretly earlier this year with a White House intelligence aide and then accused Obama officials of having requested the names of U.S. citizens seen in intercepts of communications with Russians and other foreigners. \nThe White House did not respond to requests for comment. \nThe names would have been routinely censored from intelligence agency intercepts, but Nunes charged that Obama\xe2\x80\x99s aides had leaked the information to try to undermine Trump while he was running for president. \nA spokesman for then-United Nations ambassador Samantha Power, whom Nunes and other Republicans accused of digging for political dirt, said she read intelligence reports only as part of her normal duties. A spokesman for former Obama national security adviser Susan Rice, whom Republicans also accused of misusing intelligence, did not respond to requests for comment. \nMueller is investigating meetings and conversations between Trump associates and Russian and other foreign officials and businessmen. They include Trump\xe2\x80\x99s adviser and son-in-law Jared Kushner; the president\xe2\x80\x99s eldest son Donald Trump, Jr.; former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort and former national security adviser Michael Flynn.  \n\xe2\x80\x9cAn obvious question is how all these meetings and conversations were set up,\xe2\x80\x9d said one of the sources. \xe2\x80\x9cWho set them up? What was their purpose? What were the agendas? Who approved them? Who was briefed on them afterward? Signals intelligence might shed some light on that.\xe2\x80\x9d \nRepresentatives for the Trump associates did not respond to requests for comment. \nDemocratic lawmakers have said that Nunes and others have made the assertions about the leaks to distract attention from two congressional investigations and Mueller\xe2\x80\x99s probe into the Russian matter. \nThe National Security Agency masks the names of U.S. citizens in intercepts, but officials with the necessary security clearances can request them for intelligence purposes.         \n\xe2\x80\x9cUnmasking Americans is extremely sensitive, and unmasking political opponents is really problematic,\xe2\x80\x9d said a congressional official, also speaking on the condition of anonymity. If Obama officials asked for the names or failed to justify any requests, that warranted investigation, the official said. \xc2\xa0 \nAsked for hard evidence that Power or other aides misused intelligence for political purposes or leaked such information to the media, the official declined to comment. \n'

aS' Apple Inc (\n) will launch an expected \xe2\x80\x9ciPhone 8\xe2\x80\x9d on Tuesday, hoping the number\xe2\x80\x99s auspicious connotations in China will help turn around fortunes in the world\xe2\x80\x99s biggest smartphone market. \nThe latest model is tipped to have a price tag upward of $1,000, compared with less than $800 for the top-end iPhone 7 Plus. That is unlikely to make a major dent in U.S. sales, analysts say, but could have a greater impact in China, where the cost is roughly double the average Chinese monthly salary. \nThe success of Apple\xe2\x80\x99s next iPhone in China is crucial for the Cupertino-based firm, which has seen its once-coveted phone slip into fifth position in China behind offerings from local rivals Huawei Technologies Co Ltd [HWT.UL], Oppo, Vivo and Xiaomi Inc [XTC.UL]. \nGreater China, which for Apple includes Taiwan and Hong Kong, accounted for roughly 18 percent of iPhone sales in the quarter ended in July, making it the company\xe2\x80\x99s top market after the United States and Europe. Yet those sales have been declining steadily and are down 10 percent from a year earlier, in contrast with growth in all other regions. \nAnd the iPhone\xe2\x80\x99s share of China\xe2\x80\x99s smartphone shipments fell to 9 percent in January-June, down from 14 percent in 2015, showed data from consultancy Counterpoint Research. \nWhile the iPhone 6 took China by storm in 2014, models since have received a more muted response. \n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll wait for a drop in price, it\xe2\x80\x99s too expensive,\xe2\x80\x9d said Angie Chen, 23, a project manager in Nanjing and iPhone 6 owner. \nChen said she might wait for the new phone\xe2\x80\x99s successor, when prices will fall. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a nice number to hear, but there\xe2\x80\x99s no rush.\xe2\x80\x9d \nEight is the luckiest number in China because it sounds similar to the phrase meaning \xe2\x80\x9cto get rich\xe2\x80\x9d. \n\xe2\x80\x9cApple really needs to launch a very innovative product this time around,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mo Jia, Shanghai-based analyst at Canalys. However, the rising clout of local rivals would nevertheless make life tough for the U.S. firm, he said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt has its work cut out.\xe2\x80\x9d \nThe iPhone 7 suffered from the perception that it was too similar to earlier models. This time, despite talk of wireless charging, advanced touch screen and facial recognition technology, Chinese netizens are yet to replicate the online mania around previous iPhone launches.  \nMentions of \xe2\x80\x9ciPhone 8\xe2\x80\x9d on popular Chinese social media platform Weibo - an indicator of consumer interest - were running slightly ahead of the similar period before the iPhone 7 launch, but were far more muted than with the iPhone 6. \nApple declined to comment on the new phone, price or supply. \nIn the United States, analysts are less certain that a $1,000 price will have a dramatic effect. Around four out of five of the consumers who in the past bought the top end model would likely be willing to do so again despite the price jump, estimated analyst and veteran Apple watcher Gene Munster of Loup Ventures.  \nBeyond that, Apple is expected to cover other price points by retaining some sort of low-end model similar to the current iPhone SE, which sells for $399. That is likely to ensure iPhone customers stay within the Apple ecosystem even if prices on top-end models rise. \n\xe2\x80\x9cThey need to still offer something for each market. They still will have that,\xe2\x80\x9d Munster said. \nAnother factor for U.S. sales will be discounts from carriers, which might opt to use the buzz around the new iPhone launch to lure customers away from their competitors by offering deals that would soften the blow of higher prices. \n\xe2\x80\x9cThe weapons of competition are increased phone subsidies, discounted phone payment plans and device trade-in offers,\xe2\x80\x9d BTIG analyst Walter Piecyk wrote in a note to clients. \xe2\x80\x9cPromotions are already on the rise for the Samsung phones introduced earlier this year.\xe2\x80\x9d \nIn China, one effect of Apple\xe2\x80\x99s costliest phone to date will be the rise of sales on credit. \nWang Yang, who runs a bricks-and-mortar smartphone store in Beijing\xe2\x80\x99s largest tech market, said he expected more purchases online this time, as consumers make payments by instalment. \n\xe2\x80\x9cWe will continue to stock the cheaper models or we won\xe2\x80\x99t sell much,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \nFenqile, a platform backed by Tencent Holdings Ltd (\n) allowing users to pay in instalments, said shoppers buying iPhones on the site had increased alongside rising prices - spiking in the second quarter of the year. \nServices backed by Alibaba Group Holdings Ltd (\n) and JD.com Inc (\n) have also introduced features\xc2\xa0this year aimed at price-conscious smartphone buyers, including flexible payment services and second-hand smartphone rentals. \nApple itself has launched an instalments plan in China supported by three state-linked banks. \n\xe2\x80\x9cIf it\xe2\x80\x99s under $1,100 then I\xe2\x80\x99ll buy it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Liu Song, 29, who works for a fintech startup in Beijing.  \n(For a graphic, click \n) \n'

aS' The U.N. Security Council unanimously voted to step up sanctions on North Korea, with its profitable textile exports now banned and fuel supplies capped, prompting a traditionally defiant threat of retaliation against the United States.  \nMonday\xe2\x80\x99s decision, triggered by the North\xe2\x80\x99s sixth and largest nuclear test this month, was the ninth such resolution unanimously adopted by the 15-member Security Council since 2006 over North Korea\xe2\x80\x99s ballistic missile and nuclear programs. \nJapan and South Korea said after the passage of the U.S.-drafted Security Council resolution they were prepared to apply more pressure if North Korea refused to end its aggressive development of nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles. \nA tougher initial U.S. draft was weakened to win the support of China, Pyongyang\xe2\x80\x99s main ally and trading partner, and Russia, both of which hold veto power in the council. \n\xe2\x80\x9dWe don\xe2\x80\x99t take pleasure in further strengthening sanctions today. We are not looking for war,\xe2\x80\x9c U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley told the council after the vote. \xe2\x80\x9dThe North Korean regime has not yet passed the point of no return. \n\xe2\x80\x9cIf it agrees to stop its nuclear program, it can reclaim its future ... If North Korea continues its dangerous path, we will continue with further pressure,\xe2\x80\x9d said Haley, who credited a \xe2\x80\x9cstrong relationship\xe2\x80\x9d between U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping for the successful resolution negotiations. \nNorth Korea\xe2\x80\x99s ambassador, Han Tae Song, told the U.N.-sponsored Conference on Disarmament in Geneva on Tuesday the United States was \xe2\x80\x9cfired up for political, economic, and military confrontation\xe2\x80\x9d. \nThe North regularly threatens to destroy the South and its main ally, the United States, which it accuses of continual preparation for invasion. \n\xe2\x80\x9cMy delegation condemns in the strongest terms, and categorically rejects, the latest illegal and unlawful U.N. Security Council resolution,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \nThe Democratic People\xe2\x80\x99s Republic of Korea (DPRK) was \xe2\x80\x9cready to use a form of ultimate means\xe2\x80\x9d, Han said, without elaborating. \n\xe2\x80\x9cThe forthcoming measures by DPRK will make the U.S. suffer the greatest pain it ever experienced in its history.\xe2\x80\x9d \nU.S. disarmament ambassador Robert Wood took the floor to say the Security Council resolution \xe2\x80\x9cfrankly sent a very clear and unambiguous message to the regime that the international community is tired, is no longer willing to put up with provocative behavior from this regime\xe2\x80\x9d. \nU.N. member states are now required to halt imports of textiles from North Korea, its second largest export after coal and other minerals in 2016 that totaled $752 million and accounted for a quarter of its income from trade, according to South Korean data. Nearly 80 percent went to China. \n\xe2\x80\x9cThis resolution also puts an end to the regime making money from the 93,000 North Korean citizens it sends overseas to work and heavily taxes,\xe2\x80\x9d Haley said. \n\xe2\x80\x9cThis ban will eventually starve the regime of an additional $500 million or more in annual revenues,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \nSouth Korea\xe2\x80\x99s presidential Blue House said the only way for Pyongyang to end diplomatic isolation and free itself of economic pressure was to end its nuclear program and resume dialogue. \n\xe2\x80\x9cNorth Korea needs to realize that a reckless challenge against international peace will only bring about even stronger international sanctions against it,\xe2\x80\x9d the Blue House said. \nHowever, China\xe2\x80\x99s official Xinhua news agency said in a commentary that the Trump administration was making a mistake by rejecting diplomatic engagement with the North. \n\xe2\x80\x9dThe U.S. needs to switch from isolation to communication in order to end an \xe2\x80\x98endless loop\xe2\x80\x99 on the Korean peninsula, where \xe2\x80\x9cnuclear and missile tests trigger tougher sanctions and tougher sanctions invite further tests,\xe2\x80\x9d Xinhua said. \nJapanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe quickly welcomed the resolution and said after the vote it was important to change North Korea\xe2\x80\x99s policy by stepping up pressure. \nThe resolution imposes a ban on condensates and natural gas liquids, a cap of 2 million barrels a year on refined petroleum products, and a cap on crude oil exports to North Korea at current levels. China supplies most of North Korea\xe2\x80\x99s crude. \nA U.S. official, familiar with the council negotiations and speaking on condition of anonymity, said North Korea imported about 4.5 million barrels of refined petroleum products annually and 4 million barrels of crude oil. \nChinese officials have privately expressed fears that an oil embargo could risk causing massive instability in their neighbor. Russia and China have also expressed concern about the humanitarian impact of stiffer sanctions on North Korea. \nHaley said the resolution aimed to hit \xe2\x80\x9cNorth Korea\xe2\x80\x99s ability to fuel and fund its weapons program\xe2\x80\x9d. Trump has vowed not to allow North Korea to develop a nuclear missile capable of hitting the mainland United States. \nSouth Korean officials said after the North\xe2\x80\x99s sixth nuclear test that Pyongyang could soon launch another intercontinental ballistic missile in defiance of international pressure. North Korea said its Sept. 3 test was of an advanced hydrogen bomb and was its most powerful by far. \nThe latest resolution contained new political language urging \xe2\x80\x9cfurther work to reduce tensions, so as to advance the prospects for a comprehensive settlement\xe2\x80\x9d. \nThe resolution also calls on countries to inspect vessels on the high seas, with the consent of the flag state, if they have reasonable grounds to believe the ships are carrying prohibited cargo. \nIt also bans joint ventures with North Korean entities, except for non-profit public utility infrastructure projects. \n'

aS' More than 30 lawsuits have been filed in the United States against Equifax Inc (\n) after the credit reporting company said thieves may have stolen personal information for 143 million Americans in one of the largest hackings ever. \nAt least 25 lawsuits had been filed in federal courts by Sunday, including at least one accusing the company of securities fraud, court records show. \nSeveral more lawsuits were filed against Equifax on Monday. Many of those raising similar claims will likely be combined into a single, nationwide case. \nEquifax disclosed the breach on Thursday, and said it learned of the hacking on July 29. It has set up procedures that it says are intended to help people protect their Social Security numbers and other identifying information. (\n) \nSome lawsuits criticized Equifax\xe2\x80\x99s offer of a year of free credit monitoring with its TrustedID product.  \nOne complaint filed in San Jose, California, suggested that Equifax might do this to lay a \xe2\x80\x9cfoundation\xe2\x80\x9d to pitch costlier services. It cited a Feb. 22 regulatory filing in which Atlanta-based Equifax said more companies are offering free or low-cost services such as credit scores, reports and monitoring \xe2\x80\x9cas a means to introduce consumers to premium products and services.\xe2\x80\x9d \nIn the securities fraud lawsuit, Equifax was accused of misleading shareholders about its ability to protect consumer data, inflating its financial statements and share price before the truth became known. \nThe case was filed on Friday in federal court in Atlanta by the law firm Levi & Korsinsky, which provided a copy of the complaint. A copy could not immediately be located in court records. \nEquifax\xe2\x80\x99s share price closed down $10.11, or 8.2 percent, at $113.12 on Monday. It has fallen 20.7 percent in the two trading days since the Sept. 7 disclosure of the breach, reducing Equifax\xe2\x80\x99s market value by more than $3.5 billion. \n'

aS' New York, California and three other U.S. states said on Monday they sued the federal government for delaying the rollout of higher \xe2\x80\x9cgas-guzzler\xe2\x80\x9d penalties for automakers whose vehicles fail to meet minimum fuel-economy standards. \nThe lawsuit, which also includes Vermont, Maryland and Pennsylvania, is the highest profile legal challenge to the Trump administration\xe2\x80\x99s vehicle policy to date. As part of a broad deregulation push under President Donald Trump, regulators are debating whether to grant automakers significant reductions in fuel economy requirements. \nFuel-efficient cars mean \xe2\x80\x9ccleaner air, better overall health for our children, and savings at the pump ... We will hold the Trump administration accountable,\xe2\x80\x9d California Attorney General Xavier Becerra said in a statement.  \nThe lawsuit was filed in the U.S. Court of Appeals in New York and follows a separate suit by three environmental groups over the delay. \nThe U.S. Transportation Department declined comment.  \nThe states and environmental groups are challenging the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration\xe2\x80\x99s (NHTSA) decision in July to suspend a 2016 Obama administration regulation that more than doubled penalties. \nAutomakers protested the hike, saying it could increase industry compliance costs by $1 billion annually. \nCongress ordered federal agencies in 2015 to adjust civil penalties to account for inflation and, in response, NHTSA proposed raising fines to $14 from $5.50 for every 0.1 mile per gallon of fuel that new cars and trucks consume in excess of required standards under the Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) program. \n\xe2\x80\x9cState attorneys general have made clear: we won\xe2\x80\x99t hesitate to act when those we serve are put at risk,\xe2\x80\x9d New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman said in a statement.  \nIn June, Schneiderman and attorneys general from 12 other state vowed to take legal action to block rolling back vehicle emission requirements. \nIn March, Trump ordered a review of U.S. vehicle fuel-efficiency standards for 2022-2025 put in place by the Obama administration, saying they were too tough. \nNHTSA has said the increases would potentially result in an additional $30 million in annual civil penalties. Automakers say the increases would dramatically raise costs since they would also boost the value of fuel economy credits used to meet requirements. \nSome automakers including some luxury makers historically have opted to pay fines instead of meeting fuel efficiency requirements. Jaguar Land Rover, owned by India\xe2\x80\x99s Tata Motors (\n), and Daimler AG (\n), which makes the Mercedes, paid the most in fines in recent years. \nNHTSA said in July many automakers were falling behind current fuel standards and face \xe2\x80\x9cthe possibility of paying larger CAFE penalties over the next several years.\xe2\x80\x9d \nIn 2011, the Obama administration estimated that doubling fuel efficiency requirements to a fleetwide average of 54.5 miles per gallon would save motorists $1.7 trillion in fuel costs over the life of the vehicles, but cost automakers $200 billion over 13 years. \n'

aS' British energy company BP on Monday filed for an initial public offering of its U.S. Midwest and Gulf Coast pipeline assets. \nBP Midstream Partners LP, the master limited partnership (MLP) formed by BP\'s U.S. pipeline unit, plans to list on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol "BPMP," it said in a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. (\n) \nThe offering comes nearly two months after BP outlined plans to spin off some of its U.S. pipeline assets in an IPO to raise cash. \nThe IPO revives a plan first broached internally about five years ago before slumping crude oil prices caused BP to put the idea on hold, a source told Reuters in July. \nOther energy companies that have spun off their pipeline assets include Royal Dutch Shell \xe2\x80\x94 which in 2014 raised nearly $1 billion in the largest MLP listing to date \xe2\x80\x94 and refiners such as Valero Energy Corp, Tesoro Corp and Marathon Petroleum Corp. \nAn MLP is a tax-advantaged structure often used by pipelines and other capital intensive companies to distribute excess cash to investors in the form of tax-deferred dividends. Most MLPs rely on external debt to fund new projects. \nRising interest rates have made borrowing costlier for MLPs, weighing on their performance in recent months despite stabilizing oil prices. \nThe Alerian MLP ETF has fallen 11.8 percent this year. \n\xe2\x80\x9cBP\xe2\x80\x99s rationale for an MLP structure is basically to attract more investors,\xe2\x80\x9d Raymond James analyst Muhammed Ghulam said. \nBP\xe2\x80\x99s U.S. pipeline business includes a network of 3,500 miles (5,633 kilometers) of pipelines and terminal facilities that transport and store more than 1.3 million barrels per day of oil, refined products and natural gas. In addition to the Gulf Coast and Midwest assets, BP operates pipelines in the Pacific Northwest. \nCitigroup, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Barclays, Credit Suisse and JPMorgan are among the underwriters for BP Midstream Partners\xe2\x80\x99 IPO. \nBP Midstream said it intends to raise up to $100 million in the IPO. \nThe amount of money a company says it plans to raise in its first IPO filings is used to calculate registration fees. The final size of the IPO could be different. \n'

aS' The United Nations human rights chief said on Monday that Venezuelan security forces may have committed crimes against humanity against protesters and called for an international investigation. \nBut Venezuela\xe2\x80\x99s foreign minister defended the record of the government of President Nicolas Maduro, rejecting the allegations as \xe2\x80\x9cbaseless\xe2\x80\x9d. \nVenezuela has been convulsed by months of demonstrations against the leftist president who critics say has plunged the oil-rich country into the worst economic crisis in its history and is turning it into a dictatorship. \n\xe2\x80\x9cMy investigation suggests the possibility that crimes against humanity may have been committed, which can only be confirmed by a subsequent criminal investigation,\xe2\x80\x9d Zeid Ra\xe2\x80\x98ad al Hussein told the U.N. Human Rights Council. \nHe said the government was using criminal proceedings against opposition leaders, arbitrary detentions, excessive use of force and ill-treatment of detainees, in some cases amounting to torture. \nLast month, Zeid\xe2\x80\x99s office said Venezuela\xe2\x80\x99s security forces had committed extensive and apparently deliberate human rights violations in crushing anti-government protests and that democracy was \xe2\x80\x9cbarely alive\xe2\x80\x9d. \n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is a very real danger that tensions will further escalate, with the government crushing democratic institutions and critical voices,\xe2\x80\x9d Zeid said. \nThe opposition, which boycotted the election for the Constituent Assembly, has accused electoral authorities of inflating turn-out figures for the July 30 vote. \nHowever, Foreign Minister Jorge Arreaza told the Geneva forum: \xe2\x80\x9cWe have now selected the National Constituent Assembly, this is the true expression of our citizens\xe2\x80\x99 will. It will have the powers to draw up a new Constitution.\xe2\x80\x9d  \n\xe2\x80\x9cThe opposition in Venezuela is back on the path of rule of law and democracy, we will see dialogue emerging thanks to mediation of our friends,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \nArreaza accused protesters of using firearms and \xe2\x80\x9chome-made weapons\xe2\x80\x9d against security forces, but noted that the last death was on July 30. \xe2\x80\x9cOur country is now at peace,\xe2\x80\x9d he added. \nVenezuela is among the 47 members of the Council, where it enjoys strong support from Cuba, Iran and other states. \nDiego Arria, who was Venezuela\xe2\x80\x99s ambassador to the United Nations in New York from 1991 to 1994, told a separate Geneva event organized by activists and action group UN Watch that Venezuela should be referred to the prosecutor of the International Criminal Court. \n\xe2\x80\x9cI am convinced that the killing in the streets equates to crimes against humanity,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. The Hague-based court defines such crimes as including torture, murder, deprivation of liberty, sexual violence and persecution, he said.  \nJulieta Lopez, aunt of opposition leader Leopoldo Lopez who remains under house arrest after three years in a military jail, said abuses continued. \n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is no right to express a different political opinion without being threatened, beaten or imprisoned,\xe2\x80\x9d she told the same event. \n'

Since then more than 2,400 American troops and more than 1,000 international allies have died in Afghanistan. \n\xe2\x80\x9cToday we remember how this conflict began but let us also remember how this must end, with Afghanistan never again serving as an ungoverned space, sanctuary or base for those who are bent on attacking us and our allies,\xe2\x80\x9d ambassador Hugo Llorens told a crowd of soldiers at the NATO coalition\xe2\x80\x99s headquarters in Kabul.  \nThe United states would also \xe2\x80\x9ccompletely annihilate\xe2\x80\x9d Islamic State militants in the region, Llorens said. \nThe Taliban on Monday claimed responsibility for a suicide car bombing that wounded several NATO troops and Afghan civilians in a province north Kabul. \n'

Rick Scott said.\nHe said boats were cast ashore, water, sewers and electricity were knocked out, and "I don\'t think I saw one trailer park where almost everything wasn\'t overturned." Authorities also struggled to clear the single highway connecting the string of islands to the mainland.\nThe Keys felt Irma\'s full fury when the storm blew ashore as a Category 4 hurricane Sunday morning with 130 mph (209 kph) winds. How many people in the dangerously exposed, low-lying islands defied evacuation orders and stayed behind was unclear.\nAs Irma weakened into a tropical storm and finally left Florida on Monday after a run up the entire 400-mile length of the state, the full scale of its destruction was still unknown, in part because of cutoff communications and blocked roads. Monday night, the storm had weakened to a tropical depression near Columbus, Georgia.\nSix deaths in Florida have been blamed on Irma, along with three in Georgia and one in South Carolina. At least 35 people were killed in the Caribbean.\nStatewide, an estimated 13 million people, or two-thirds of Florida\'s population, remained without power. That\'s more than the population of New York and Los Angeles combined. Officials warned it could take weeks for electricity to be restored to everyone.\nMore than 180,000 people huddled in shelters in the Sunshine State.\n"How are we going to survive from here?" asked Gwen Bush, who waded through thigh-deep floodwaters outside her central Florida home to reach National Guard rescuers and get a ride to a shelter. "What\'s going to happen now? I just don\'t know."\nThe governor said it was way too early to put a dollar estimate on the damage.\nDuring its march up Florida\'s west coast, Irma swamped homes, uprooted trees, flooded streets, snapped miles of power lines and toppled construction cranes.\nIn a parting shot, it triggered severe flooding around Jacksonville in the state\'s northeastern corner. It also spread misery into Georgia and South Carolina as it moved inland with winds at 50 mph, causing flooding and power outages.\nAround the Tampa-St. Petersburg area, where Irma rolled through early Monday, damage appeared modest. And the governor said damage on the southwest coast, including in Naples and Fort Myers, was not as bad as feared. In the Keys, though, he said "there is devastation."\n"It\'s horrible, what we saw," Scott said. "I know for our entire state, especially the Keys, it\'s going to be a long road."\nHe said the Navy dispatched the USS Iwo Jima, USS New York and the aircraft carrier Abraham Lincoln to help with search and rescue and other relief efforts.\nEmergency managers in the islands declared on Monday "the Keys are not open for business" and warned that there was no fuel, electricity, running water or cell service and that supplies were low and anxiety high.\n"HELP IS ON THE WAY," they promised on Facebook.\nThe Keys are linked by 42 bridges that have to be checked for safety before motorists can be allowed in, officials said. The governor said the route also needs to be cleared of debris and sand, but should be usable fairly quickly.\nIn the Jacksonville area, close to the Georgia line, storm surge brought some of the worst flooding ever seen there, with at least 46 people pulled from swamped homes.\nThe Jacksonville Sheriff\'s Office warned residents along the St. Johns River to "Get out NOW."\n"If you need to get out, put a white flag in front of your house. A t-shirt, anything white," the office said on its Facebook page. "Search and rescue teams are ready to deploy."\nA tornado spun off by Irma was reported on the Georgia coast, and firefighters inland had to rescue several people after trees fell on their homes.\nA tropical storm warning was issued for the first time ever in Atlanta, and school was canceled in communities around the state. More than 1.5million customers were without power Monday night in Georgia.\nOver the next two days, Irma is expected to push to the northwest, into Alabama, Mississippi and Tennessee.\nPeople in the heavily populated Tampa-St. Petersburg area had braced for the first direct hit from a major hurricane since 1921. But by the time Irma arrived in the middle of the night Monday, its winds were down to 100 mph (161 kph) or less.\n"When that sun came out this morning and the damage was minimal, it became a good day," said Tampa Mayor Bob Buckhorn.\n'

aS" The Latest on Irma (all times local):\n10:40 p.m.\nThe National Hurricane Center says Irma has weakened into a tropical depression.\nThe storm, located about 5 miles (10 kilometers) west of Columbus, Georgia, is still bringing heavy rain to the U.S. Southeast on Monday night.\nIrma is expected to drop 2 to 5 inches of rain across South Carolina and northern portions of Georgia, Alabama and Mississippi.\nIrma's top sustained winds are 35 mph (55 kph), and it is moving northwest at 15 mph (24 kph).\nThe hurricane center has discontinued all storm surge and tropical storm warnings.\n"

aS' The historic but often decrepit buildings of Havana and other colonial Cuban cities couldn\'t stand up to Hurricane Irma\'s winds and rainfall, collapsing and killing seven people in one of the highest death tolls from the storm\'s passage through the Caribbean.\nAuthorities said Monday that three more people were killed by falling objects or drowning, pushing the death toll to 10 in Cuba and at least 24 others in the Caribbean. It was Cuba\'s worst hurricane death toll since 16 died in Hurricane Dennis in 2005.\nMost of Cuba\'s grand old buildings were confiscated from the wealthy and distributed to the poor and middle classes after a 1959 revolution that promised housing, health care and education as universal rights. But with state salaries of about $25 a month and government agencies strapped for cash, most buildings have seen little maintenance in decades.\nTropical rain and sea spray have chewed into unpainted facades and seeped through unpatched roofs. Trees have sprouted from balconies. Iron rebar has rusted, sloughing off chunks of powdery concrete.\nDamage wasn\'t limited to Havana. More than 100 houses in a small town on Cuba\'s coastline were destroyed in Matanzas Province when Irma swept through the area, leaving hundreds of people homeless.\nIn every neighborhood, residents talk warily about the buildings that are one hurricane away from total collapse.\nThat hurricane came Saturday and Sunday as Irma ground up the northern coast, sending chest-high seawater six blocks into Central Havana and blasting the city with 60 mph winds.\nOn Galeano Street in Central Havana, a fourth-floor balcony dropped onto a bus carrying Maria del Carmen Arregoitia Cardona and Yolendis Castillo Mart\xc3\xadnez, both 27. In the cities of Matanzas, Ciego de Avila and Camaguey, three men in their 50s and 60s died in building collapses. The government noted in a sternly worded press release that each "did not observe the behavior recommended by Civil Defense."\nOn Animas Street in Central Havana, 51-year-old Walfrido Antonio Valdes Perez was caring for his older brother, Roydis, who worked as a florist until he was diagnosed with HIV. They lived on the second floor of building divided into 11 apartments, many of them divided by crude intermediate floors known as "barbeques."\nAfter midnight, as wind whipped the neighborhood, a wall collapsed onto the roof of their building, crushing the two brothers to death.\nNo one noticed until the next morning, when neighbors saw a foot sticking out of the rubble.\n"We felt something, but no one imagined the roof and barbeque had collapsed," said homemaker Yudisleidis Mederos, 34. "These building are in really bad shape. Their room was the best one."\nShe and her neighbors remembered Roydis, 54, as a kind and helpful man who had become a virtual family member, helping care for their children, feed them and put them down for naps.\nNeighbors said they were ready to evacuate Saturday but emergency officials never asked them to leave.\nOn Monday, they showed the cracks running through the walls of their building, water leaking through the halls and living spaces, naked metal beams and loose gas pipes and electric cables.\n"We\'ve been trying to fix things for years. It\'s a shame that maybe they\'ll come now, only after two people have died," said homemaker Laritza Penalver, 49.\nHavana was in recovery mode Monday, with crews cleaning away thousands of fallen trees and electric restored to a handful of neighborhoods. Schools were closed until further notice. President Raul Castro issued a message to the nation that didn\'t mention the deaths, but described damage to "housing, the electrical system and agriculture."\nHe also acknowledged destruction in the northern keys where Cuba and foreign hotel management firms have built dozens of all-inclusive beach resorts in recent years. The Jardines del Rey airport serving the northern keys was destroyed, the Communist Party newspaper Granma reported, tweeting photos of a shattered terminal hall littered with debris.\n"The storm hit some of our principal tourist destinations but the damage will be repaired before the high season," starting in November, Castro wrote.\nTo the east, in the Leeward Islands known as the playground for the rich and famous, governments came under criticism for failing to respond quickly to the hurricane, which flattened many towns and turned lush, green hills to a brown stubble.\nResidents have reported food, water and medicine shortages, as well as looting.\nBritish Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson defended his government\'s response to what he called an "unprecedented catastrophe" and promised to increase funding for the relief effort. Britain sent a navy ship and almost 500 troops to the British Virgin Islands, Anguilla and the Turks and Caicos islands.\nThe U.S. government said it was sending a flight Monday to evacuate its citizens from St. Martin, one of the hardest-hit islands where 10 people were killed. Evacuees were warned to expect long lines and no running water at the airport.\nA Royal Caribbean Cruise Line ship was expected to dock near St. Martin to help in the aftermath, and a boat was bringing a 5-ton crane capable of unloading large shipping containers of aid. A French military ship was scheduled to arrive Tuesday with materials for temporary housing.\nAbout 70 percent of the beds at the main hospital in the French portion of St. Martin were severely damaged, and more than 100 people needing urgent medical care were evacuated. Eight of the territory\'s 11 pharmacies were destroyed, and Guadeloupe was sending medication.\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron was scheduled to arrive in St. Martin on Tuesday to bring aid and fend off criticism that he didn\'t do enough to respond to the storm.\nThe "whole government is mobilized" to help, said Interior Minister Gerard Collomb.\n'

aS' In the chaotic days after Hurricane Irma smashed St. Martin, the storm also exposed simmering racial tensions on the island\'s French territory, with some black and mixed-race residents complaining that white tourists were given priority during the evacuation.\nIt was the type of anger that has long plagued France\'s far-flung former colonies \xe2\x80\x94 especially its Caribbean territories, where most of the population identifies as black and is poorer than the white minority.\nJohana Soudiagom was disturbed to find herself among a tiny handful of non-whites evacuated by boat to nearby Guadeloupe after Irma devastated the island.\n"It\'s selective. Excuse me, but we saw only mainlanders," she told Guadeloupe 1ere television, visibly shaken. "That\'s a way of saying, \'I\'m sorry, only whites. There are only whites on the boat.\'"\nIt\'s common practice for tourists to be evacuated first from disaster zones for practical reasons, as they are staying in hotels and not in their homes and tend to have fewer resources such as food and vehicles. The French prime minister insisted Monday that the only people being prioritized were the most vulnerable.\nGovernment spokesman Christophe Castaner said he understood islanders\' frustration with the government response but blamed part of the controversy on their "emotional shock, an impact that\'s extremely hard psychologically."\nSoudiagom and other witnesses told Guadeloupe 1ere that the boat they took Friday carried tourists, including Americans, to safety but left many St. Martin residents behind, including needy mothers and children.\nOn Monday, France\'s Representative Council of Black Associations asked the government for a parliamentary inquiry, citing concerns that those who were evacuated were not "necessarily the most in distress."\n"In my eyes, Irma is for the French Antilles what Hurricane Katrina was for Louisiana in the U.S. \xe2\x80\x94 an exposer of racial and social inequalities," the group\'s spokesman, Louis-Georges Tin, told The Associated Press.\nThe terror of facing down a Category 5 hurricane has combined with a long-held sense of isolation among local residents of St. Martin, some 6,700 kilometers (4,200 miles) from the French mainland and popular with European tourists.\n"The natural catastrophe occurred in a place that\'s very vulnerable socially, where there is a population of many different skin colors and a history of slavery," said Michel Giraud, a French researcher who writes on race. "Of course there will be a perception of racism."\nThe island of St. Martin \xe2\x80\x94 divided in the 17th century into the French territory of Saint-Martin and the Dutch territory of Sint Maarten \xe2\x80\x94 measures just 87 square kilometers (34 square miles). Its 80,000 residents are a vibrant ethnic mix descended mainly from Africa, Europe and Asia. The two sides of the island share a creole language that draws heavily on English vocabulary.\nThe French part of St. Martin is similar to other French holdings in the Caribbean in that its white minority is generally wealthier than its black majority. Because France bans the collection of data on race, there are no statistics to show how much wealthier.\nIt began as a colony whose economy was fueled by African slaves. But after slavery was abolished in 1848, Tin said, "there were no reparations for the slaves, only for the slave owners," so the former slaves won freedom but remained destitute. "The economy is now based on tourism but it is still poor. The wages are significantly lower than the mainland France."\nThe government is not the only one being accused of racial bias in the wake of the storm. Giraud said French television reports on the devastation focused disproportionately on white people.\n"When I saw the pictures, I was shocked," Giraud said. "In the coverage I saw, the victims were mostly white tourists, or white French mainlanders. But the poorest are always the first victims."\nIrma hit St. Martin on Wednesday, killing at least nine people on the French part of the island and damaging a majority of its buildings.\nThe following day, looters were seen hauling food, water and televisions from shops, and videos featuring predominantly black people raiding shops circulated online. Some took to social media to blame the thieving on non-whites and characterized the white evacuees as innocents escaping the chaos.\nTin said the island\'s poorer residents were doing what they had to after an ineffective government response.\n"What some call theft, others call survival," he said. "When the state doesn\'t do its job, it\'s normal that the poorest do what\'s necessary to survive."\n"In Florida, there were more than 1 million evacuated, and France says that with four days\' notice they couldn\'t evacuate a much smaller number," Tin said. "The question must be asked: Does it have to do with racism?"\nThe government argues that it is more difficult to transport tens of thousands of people off small islands in stormy weather than it is to tell people to drive to safety.\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron planned to fly to St. Martin on Tuesday to inspect the damage and relief operations and to reassure the local population.\n'

aS' A grinding chorus of chain saws and generators kicked in quickly after Hurricane Irma\'s roar left Sweetwater, a small, mostly Spanish-speaking town west of Miami where streets were swamped, fences and trees fell, cars got stuck in floodwater and shed roofs bent like tin foil.\nAdrian Ortiz, 28, was philosophical as he sat in his BMW on Monday, waiting rather ambitiously for a tow truck. He had tried to make a run home from his girlfriend\'s house during the storm, but his sports car stalled after a few blocks as 6th street turned into a wind-whipped canal. He touched the carpet -- still soggy.\n"I decided to come to Sweetwater, and my car got full of sweet water," he said with a shrug.\nElectricity was out across the city, but the people were powered by coffee and little sandwiches, handed through "cafecito" windows that opened early. Residents with weary eyes struggled to clear tree branches and debris. City trucks with giant metal claws were handling the big stuff.\nSweetwater\'s name echoes the "river of grass" whose banks were rained for development nearly a century ago: Miami is a Seminole Indian word meaning "sweet water." The carving up of the Everglades has never slowed. Newer suburbs now stretch for miles between Sweetwater and the swamp, where water levels are now carefully controlled.\nThis community was spared from the storm surge, but the ground will likely remain saturated for a while. Ahead of the hurricane, the South Florida Water Management District fully opened flood gates to drain water from recent rainstorms into the oceans. Now the trillions of gallons of ocean water Irma dumped on its northward march is also flowing south.\nIrma isn\'t Sweetwater\'s first hurricane by far: The town was being planned when the 1926 Miami Hurricane devastated the area, and development was put on hold during a post-storm real estate bust. In a peculiarly Floridian twist, Russian dwarves revived it the late 1930s, looking for a place to retire.\nNow it\'s the heart of Miami-Dade County\'s Nicaraguan community, and over 90 percent of the Miami suburb is Hispanic.\nJesus Castillo, 50, and his family who have lived in the neighborhood for about nine years. They were cleaning up flood muck and plant debris.\n"My entire patio was underwater, and in the street it was two-to-three feet high," Castillo said in Spanish.\nAround the corner, a group of friends helped a woman clear a large tree that had splintered like a toothpick in her backyard, while her neighbor, Bayardo Perez, wrestled with a mangled tin shed roof.\nPerez, 62, has lived in the house for decades, through Hurricane Andrew in 1992, and now, Irma.\n"This one was worse than Andrew for me," he said, finally freeing the mangled roof and throwing it on a pile of debris.\n'

aS' Americans commemorated 9/11 on Monday with tear-streaked tributes, a presidential warning to terrorists and appeals from victims\' relatives for unity and hope 16 years after the deadliest terrorist attack on U.S. soil.\nLooking out at the solemn crowd at ground zero, Debra Epps said she views every day as time to do something to ensure that her brother, Christopher Epps, and thousands of others didn\'t die in vain.\n"What I can say today is that I don\'t live my life in complacency," she said. "I stand in solidarity that this world will make a change for the better."\nThousands of family members, survivors, rescuers and others gathered for the hourslong reading of victims\' names at the World Trade Center, while President Donald Trump spoke at the Pentagon and Vice President Mike Pence addressed an observance at the Flight 93 National Memorial near Shanksville, Pennsylvania.\nElsewhere, thousands of Americans marked the anniversary with service projects. Volunteer Hillary O\'Neill, 16, had her own connection to 9/11: It\'s her birthdate.\n"I always feel a sense of responsibility to give back on the day," O\'Neill, of Norwalk, Connecticut, said as she packed up meals in New York City for needy local people and hurricane victims in Texas and Florida.\nNearly 3,000 people were killed when planes hijacked by terrorists hit the trade center, the Pentagon and a field near Shanksville on Sept. 11, 2001, hurling America into a new consciousness of the threat of global terrorism.\nReflecting on a tragedy that still feels immediate to them, victims\' relatives thanked first responders and the military, worried for people affected by Hurricane Irma as it continued its destructive path as a tropical storm and pleaded for a return to the sense of cohesiveness that followed the attacks.\n"Our country came together that day. And it did not matter what color you were or where you were from," said a tearful Magaly Lemagne, who lost her brother, Port Authority of New York and New Jersey police officer David Lemagne. She implored people to "stop for a moment and remember all the people who gave their lives that day.\n"Maybe then we can put away our disagreements and become one country again," she said.\nTrump, a native New Yorker observing the anniversary for the first time as the country\'s leader, assured victims\' families that "our entire nation grieves with you" and issued stern words to extremists.\n"America cannot be intimidated, and those who try will join a long list of vanquished enemies who dared test our mettle," the Republican president said as he spoke at the Pentagon after observing a moment of silence at the White House.\nWhen America is united, "no force on earth can break us apart," he said.\nAt the Flight 93 National Memorial, Pence said the passengers who revolted against hijackers might well have saved his own life.\nThe Republican vice president was a member of Congress on 9/11, and the Capitol was a possible target of the terrorist piloting Flight 93. Instead, it crashed near Shanksville after the passengers took action. Thirty-three passengers and seven crew members were killed.\nAt the United Nations, some ambassadors noted the anniversary as the Security Council unanimously approved new sanctions against North Korea in response to its Sept. 3 test of what Pyongyang said was a hydrogen bomb\n"We will never forget the victims of Sept. 11, and we will never forget the lesson that those who have evil intentions must be confronted," U.S. Ambassador Nikki Haley said.\nAt dusk, the annual "Tribute in Light" art installation beamed two giant towers of light into the lower Manhattan skyline as a visual memorial to those who perished in the terror attack.\nThe ceremony on the National September 11 Memorial & Museum plaza in New York strives to be apolitical, allowing politicians to attend but not to speak. Yet last year\'s 15th anniversary ceremony became entangled in the presidential campaign when Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton left abruptly, stumbled into a van and ultimately revealed she\'d been diagnosed days earlier with pneumonia.\nThis year, the focus remained on the names read out beneath the waterfall pools and lines of trees.\nWhile many Americans may no longer interrupt their days to observe the 9/11 anniversary, the ceremony remains a touchstone for many victims\' families and friends.\n"I\'ll come every year for the rest of my life," said Rob Fazio, who lost his father, Ronald Fazio. "It\'s where I get my strength."\nAfter 15 years of anniversaries, the reading of names, moments of silence and tolling bells have become rituals, but each ceremony takes on personal touches. Name-readers Monday gave updates on family graduations and marriages and remembered loved ones\' flair for surfing or drawing on coffee-shop napkins.\nA few never even got to know the relatives they lost on Sept. 11, 2001.\n"I wish more than anything that I could have met you," Ruth Daly said after reading names in remembrance of her slain grandmother and namesake, Ruth Lapin.\nDelaney Colaio read names in honor of the three relatives she lost: her father, Mark Joseph Colaio, and her uncles, Stephen Colaio and Thomas Pedicini. Just a toddler on 9/11, she is now making a documentary about the children who lost parents in the attacks.\n"I stand here as a reminder to the other families of 9/11 and to the world," she said, "that no matter how dark moments of life can get, there is light ahead if you just choose hope."\n'

aS' A government backlog of 700,000 security clearance reviews has led agencies like the Defense Department to inadvertently issue interim passes to criminals \xe2\x80\x94 even rapists and killers \xe2\x80\x94 fueling calls for better and faster vetting of people with access to the nation\'s secrets.\nThe pileup, which is government-wide, is causing work delays for both federal and private intelligence efforts. It takes about four months to acquire a clearance to gain access to "secret" information on a need-to-know basis, and nine to 10 months for "top-secret" clearance.\nEfforts to reduce the backlog coincide with pressure to tighten the reins on classified material. In recent years, intelligence agencies have suffered some of the worst leaks of classified information in U.S. history. Still, calls for a faster clearance process are getting louder.\n"If we don\'t do interim clearances, nothing gets done," Dan Payne, director of the U.S. Defense Security Service, said last week at an intelligence conference.\nYet Payne described handing out interim clearances as risky business. On the basis of partial background checks, people are being given access to secret and top-secret information sometimes for long periods of time, he said.\n"I\'ve got murderers who have access to classified information," he said. "I have rapists. I have pedophiles. I have people involved in child porn. I have all these things at the interim clearance level and I\'m pulling their clearances on a weekly basis."\n"We are giving those people access to classified information with only the minimum amount of investigation. This is why we have to fix this process. This is why we have to drive these timelines down."\nPayne didn\'t say how many criminals his agency has discovered, if their offenses were new or old, or if any of them had mishandled classified material. Efforts to reach him for this story were unsuccessful.\nPeople being investigated for interim clearances are subject to background checks, too, but quick access to state and local records can be challenging, said a former Defense Department official, who was not authorized to speak about the issue and commented only on condition of anonymity.\nMore than 4.3 million people hold security clearances of various levels, according to the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. They include nearly 3 million at the "confidential" or "secret" level and more than 1 million at the "top secret" level.\nChecking federal employees and private contractors is a laborious process that requires an extensive background check and an effort to judge a person\'s trustworthiness.\nNinety-five percent of all background investigations are conducted by the National Background Investigations Bureau, which does some of the work itself and contracts the rest to private firms.\nThe backlog grew significantly after the government stopped doing business with a contractor that suffered a data breach in 2014. That depleted the government\'s capacity to do investigations by 60 percent, said Charles Phalen, director of the investigations bureau.\nHundreds of new investigators have been hired since, Phalen said, but the backlog is "still way high."\nHe and other officials think the process needs to be updated to ensure the government can spot possible problems in real time.\nIs a clearance holder dealing with money woes or personal problems, such as alcohol or drug addiction? Is there unexplained foreign travel, questionable use of computer networks, or other issues that might point to possible leaks?\nRight now, clearance holders are reinvestigated about every five years, adding to the background checks for first-time applicants. Intelligence officials, industry leaders and lawmakers say continuous monitoring and evaluation are preferable.\nIn today\'s fast-paced world, they argue, it doesn\'t make sense to wait years to find out someone is experiencing financial problems, making him susceptible to selling classified information.\nMany U.S. intelligence agencies already are onboard. The Defense Department also has begun more regular vetting. It has 500,000 people \xe2\x80\x94 contractors and military personnel among them \xe2\x80\x94 enrolled in what it calls "continuous evaluation," which involves regular checks through law enforcement and other databases.  Up to 1 million will be enrolled by the end of the year, Payne said.\nThe improved vetting has led to 48 people losing their clearances based on information uncovered years before they would have been up for their next scheduled review. Several hundred additional cases have been flagged for additional investigation.\nSen. Mark Warner of Virginia, the Senate intelligence committee\'s top Democrat, said an overhaul of the clearance system is long overdue, particularly if the government hopes to continue to attract top-notch workers and recent graduates.\nAnd Vice Adm. Jan Tighe, deputy chief of naval operations for information warfare and director of naval intelligence, said the backlog is threatening the civilian workforce\'s readiness.\n"We are losing talent to other places," Tighe said.\nThe backlog also is complicating transitions of mid-career intelligence professionals from agency to agency and in and out of private industry. It takes time to process clearances for these transfers, too.\nOver the years, various executive orders and legislation have called for change \xe2\x80\x94 none successfully.\n"This is one of these processes that have been unchanged for decades," said Maj. Gen. Michael Groen, the Marine Corp\'s director of intelligence. "It\'s screaming for a different way to do business."\nIntelligence professionals say serious changes are needed in the entire system, which dates to the late 1940s. That was long before the internet, social media, cyberattacks and massive classified disclosures like the National Security Agency leak perpetrated by Edward Snowden.\n"I do not think this is one of lacing up our shoes tighter and putting more people against it," said Sue Gordon, principal deputy national intelligence director. "We have to reimagine how this is done."\n'

aS' A decade after then-CEO Steve Jobs unveiled the first iPhone, Apple Inc (\n) on Tuesday is set to introduce a completely redesigned top-of-the-line iPhone along with two other new phones, as well as a big upgrade to the Apple Watch and a higher-definition Apple TV. \nThe splashy launch event will take place at the Steve Jobs Theater at Apple\xe2\x80\x99s new Apple Park \xe2\x80\x9cspaceship\xe2\x80\x9d campus - widely considered to be the final product designed by Jobs, who died in 2011. \nThe new products and the holiday shopping season that follows are the most important for Apple in years. The company has sold more than 1.2 billion iPhones over the past decade and ushered in the era of mobile computing, but last year suffered a substantial decline in revenue as many consumers rejected the iPhone 7 as being too similar to the iPhone 6. \nApple hopes the new high-end phone, expected to be called the iPhone X, will silence critics who say the company has lost its innovation edge. It features an edge-to-edge display with richer colors and facial recognition to unlock the phone without the need for a fingerprint reader or physical home button.  \nThe two other models, expected to be called the iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus, are intended to update the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. They could also include some new features, such as a glass back similar to the iPhone 4 that would help facilitate wireless charging. \nThe phones are expected to come with a steep price tag. Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi predicts the top-end model will cost $899, though other analysts expect it to cross the $1,000 threshold. That compares to a top base price of $769 for the iPhone 7 Plus prior. \nMuch of that added costs is driven by more expensive parts, like a higher-resolution display, 3D sensors and more memory capacity. \xe2\x80\x9cSome of these components are just darned expensive. There\xe2\x80\x99s just no doubt about that,\xe2\x80\x9d said Brian Blau, an Apple analyst at Gartner.  \nBlau expects Apple to keep several lower priced models in its lineup. \nAnalysts also expect Apple to reveal a new Apple TV that operates at higher resolution than its previous set. The higher resolution could play into Apple\xe2\x80\x99s efforts to court Hollywood, which have shifted into a higher gear recently with two high-profile executives hired away from Sony. \nThe company is also expected to reveal more details about the HomePod, its voice-activated home speaker that competes against Amazon.com Inc\xe2\x80\x99s (\n) Echo devices and the Google (\n) Home speaker. Apple announced the HomePod in June and said it will ship in December. \nLastly, Apple is expected to announce a new version of the Apple Watch. Previous versions of the watch had to be tethered to a user\xe2\x80\x99s phone in order to receive send or receive data, but the new version is expected to connect to wireless data networks just like a phone. \nApple does not say how many Apple Watches it sells. Gene Munster, a veteran Apple watcher and analyst with Loup Ventures, believes the watch could double or even triple in sales because of the new connectivity. \nBut even a huge boom in one product will not move the company\xe2\x80\x99s financials like the iPhone, which accounted for 63 percent of Apple\xe2\x80\x99s $215 billion in sales last year.

aS' European car bosses are beginning to address the realities of mass vehicle electrification, and its consequences for jobs and profit, their minds focused by government pledges to outlaw the combustion engine. \nAs the latest such announcement on Monday by China added momentum to a push for zero-emissions motoring, Daimler (\n), Volkswagen (\n) and PSA Group (\n) gave details about their electric programs that could give policymakers some pause. \nPlanned electric Mercedes models will initially be just half as profitable as conventional alternatives, Daimler warned - forcing the group to find savings by outsourcing more component manufacturing, which may in turn threaten German jobs. \n\xe2\x80\x9cIn-house production is almost irrelevant to the consumer,\xe2\x80\x9d Daimler boss Dieter Zetsche told reporters on the eve of the Frankfurt auto show, in the midst of a German election campaign in which automotive jobs have loomed large. \nThe company set a target of saving 4 billion euros ($4.8 billion) by 2025 to help fund the cost of its electric cars. \n\xe2\x80\x9cDaimler is the first company to state explicitly how much electric vehicles are going to hurt margins,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bernstein analyst Max Warburton. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was brave to go first - but of course it won\xe2\x80\x99t be the last.\xe2\x80\x9d \nVolkswagen (VW), for its part, said it was seeking new global supplier contracts to source 50 billion euros ($60 billion) of electric car content including batteries, which are not yet manufactured competitively in Europe. \n\xe2\x80\x9cA company like Volkswagen must lead, not follow,\xe2\x80\x9d Chief Executive Matthias Mueller told reporters.  \nVW diesel emissions-cheating exposed by U.S. regulators in 2015 triggered global public outrage, dozens more investigations into test-rigging by the wider industry and a push by some lawmakers to ban diesel and eventually all engines. \nTesla Inc (\n) shares jumped nearly 6 percent on Monday after a Chinese minister said it was a question of when, not if, Beijing bans fossil-fuel cars, tightening the noose around the combustion engine. France and Britain have promised its outright abolition by 2040. \nBut PSA, the maker of Peugeots and Citroens, said it was concerned about the risks if consumers were left behind in the rush, and a new generation of battery cars does not sell. \n\xe2\x80\x9cIf it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t gain acceptance in the market, then everybody - industry, employees and politicians - has a big problem,\xe2\x80\x9d PSA Chief Executive Carlos Tavares said in a pre-show interview with German weekly Bild am Sonntag. \nWhile Tesla has carved itself a successful premium niche, electric vehicles have yet to penetrate mass markets, with the heavily subsidized exception of Norway, and still account for less than 1 percent of global car sales. \nAutomakers have sought to adapt to the changing tide - and in some cases distance themselves from \xe2\x80\x9cdieselgate\xe2\x80\x9d - by announcing multibillion-euro investments in electric cars, underpinned by plans to sell millions within a decade. \nA year into the scandal, VW unveiled plans to develop 30 new electric cars and sell 2-3 million annually by 2025. On Monday it upped the goal to 80 models and said it would need four times the capacity of Tesla\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cgigafactory\xe2\x80\x9d to supply their batteries. \nSince the battery is the single biggest-value item in an electric car, however, experts point out that mass adoption would shift business and jobs from European suppliers to China, which already dominates the automotive power-pack market. \nAccording to consulting firm AlixPartners, electric drivetrains including batteries require 40 percent less manufacturing labor than mechanical ones. That would hit 112,000 jobs at European suppliers, even before any outsourcing. \nA phase-out of combustion engines by 2030 could cost 600,000 jobs in Germany alone, the country\xe2\x80\x99s Ifo economic institute has warned. Chancellor Angela Merkel, on course for re-election on Sept. 24, said she was \xe2\x80\x9cno friend of bans\xe2\x80\x9d, in a Berliner Zeitung interview published on Tuesday. \nSpeaking to a television audience of voters on Monday evening, Merkel said the industry would need support in its transformation. \xe2\x80\x9cThe government still has to do more to set incentives,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, without giving details.  \nBosch, the world\xe2\x80\x99s biggest automotive supplier, on Tuesday lamented the \xe2\x80\x9cone dimensional nature\xe2\x80\x9d of the debate, saying electric vehicles were not the only way to reduce pollution. \nThe German company is exploring synthetic fuels, which would have the advantage of being able to use existing filling stations and engines, its CEO Volkmar Denner told a news conference, adding this could potentially save 2.8 gigatonnes of CO2 by 2050 - three times as much as Germany produced in 2016.  \n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is a faster way of limiting global warming,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \nIndependent analyst Richard Windsor warned that far from boosting the industry, a shift to electric cars - which are expected to last longer than combustion-engined equivalents and require less maintenance - could inflict long-term damage. \n\xe2\x80\x9cVehicle makers are queuing up to announce their commitment to electric vehicles but at the same time they may be cheering for their own demise,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \n'

aS' President Donald Trump is weighing a strategy that could allow more aggressive U.S. responses to Iran\xe2\x80\x99s forces, its Shi\xe2\x80\x98ite Muslim proxies in Iraq and Syria, and its support for militant groups, according to six current and former U.S. officials. \nThe proposal was prepared by Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, national security adviser H.R. McMaster and other top officials, and presented to Trump at a National Security Council meeting on Friday, the sources said. \nIt could be agreed and made public before the end of September, two of the sources said. All of the sources are familiar with the draft and requested anonymity because Trump has yet to act on it. \nIn contrast to detailed instructions handed down by President Barack Obama and some of his predecessors, Trump is expected to set broad strategic objectives and goals for U.S. policy but leave it to U.S. military commanders, diplomats and other U.S. officials to implement the plan, said a senior administration official. \n\xe2\x80\x9cWhatever we end up with, we want to implement with allies to the greatest extent possible,\xe2\x80\x9d the official added. \nThe White House declined to comment. \nThe plan is intended to increase the pressure on Tehran to curb its ballistic missile programs and support for militants, several sources said. \n\xe2\x80\x9cI would call it a broad strategy for the range of Iranian malign activities: financial materials, support for terror, destabilization in the region, especially Syria and Iraq and Yemen,\xe2\x80\x9d said another senior administration official.\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \nThe proposal also targets cyber espionage and other activity and potentially nuclear proliferation, the official said. \nThe administration is still debating a new stance on a 2015 agreement, sealed by Obama, to curb Iran\xe2\x80\x99s nuclear weapons program. The draft urges consideration of tougher economic sanctions if Iran violates the 2015 agreement. \nThe proposal includes more aggressive U.S. interceptions of Iranian arms shipments such as those to Houthi rebels in Yemen and Palestinian groups in Gaza and Egypt\xe2\x80\x99s Sinai, a current official and a knowledgeable former U.S. official said. \nThe plan also recommends the United States react more aggressively in Bahrain, whose Sunni Muslim monarchy has been suppressing majority Shi\xe2\x80\x98ites, who are demanding reforms, the sources said. \nIn addition, U.S. naval forces could react more forcefully when harassed by armed speed boats operated by the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, Iran\xe2\x80\x99s paramilitary and espionage contingent, three of the sources said. \nU.S. ships have fired flares and warning shots to drive off IRGC boats that made what were viewed as threatening approaches after refusing to heed radio warnings in the passageway for 35 percent of the world\xe2\x80\x99s seaborne petroleum exports. \nU.S. commanders now are permitted to open fire only when they think their vessels and the lives of their crews are endangered. The sources offered no details of the proposed changes in the rules, which are classified. \nThe plan does not include an escalation of U.S. military activity in Syria and Iraq. Trump\xe2\x80\x99s national security aides argued that a more muscular military response to Iranian proxies in Syria and Iraq would complicate the U.S.-led fight against Islamic State, which they argued should remain the top priority, four of the sources said. \nMattis and McMaster, as well as the heads of the U.S. Central Command and U.S. Special Forces Command, have opposed allowing U.S. commanders in Syria and Iraq to react more forcefully to provocations by the IRGC, Hezbollah and other Iranian-backed Shi\xe2\x80\x98ite militias, the four sources said. \nThe advisers are concerned that more permissive rules of engagement would divert U.S. forces from defeating the remnants of Islamic State, they said. \nMoreover, looser rules could embroil the United States in a conflict with Iran while U.S. forces remain overstretched, and Trump has authorized a small troop increase for Afghanistan, said one senior administration official. \nA former U.S. official said Hezbollah and Iranian-backed Shi\xe2\x80\x98ite militias in Iraq have been \xe2\x80\x9cvery helpful\xe2\x80\x9d in recapturing vast swaths of the caliphate that Islamic State declared in Syria and Iran in 2014. \nU.S. troops supporting Kurdish and Sunni Arab fighters battling Islamic State in Syria have been wrestling with how to respond to hostile actions by Iranian-backed forces. \nIn some of the most notable cases, U.S. aircraft shot down two Iranian-made drones in June. Both were justified as defensive acts narrowly tailored to halt an imminent threat on the ground. \nTrump\xe2\x80\x99s opposition to the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), poses a dilemma for policymakers. \nMost of his national security aides favor remaining in the pact, as do U.S. allies Israel and Saudi Arabia despite their reservations about Iran\xe2\x80\x99s adherence to the agreement, said U.S. officials involved in the discussions. \n\xe2\x80\x9cThe main issue for us was to get the president not to discard the JCPOA. But he had very strong feelings, backed by (U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations) Nikki Haley, that they should be more aggressive with Iran,\xe2\x80\x9d one of the two U.S. officials said. \xe2\x80\x9cAlmost all the strategies presented to him were ones that tried to preserve the JCPOA but lean forward on these other (issues.)\xe2\x80\x9d \n'

aS' U.S. President Donald Trump plans to host a bipartisan group of senators for dinner on Tuesday to make a push for tax reform and other top agenda items a week after he made an alliance with Democrats on raising the debt ceiling and funding government. \nThe White House announced the dinner with the Republican president late on Monday, and a White House aide confirmed the guest list included three Democrats: Joe Donnelly of Indiana, Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota and Joe Manchin of West Virginia. \nIt also included Republican members of the Senate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch of Utah, Patrick Toomey of Pennsylvania and John Thune of South Dakota, the aide said, confirming a guest list first reported by the Washington Post.      \n\xe2\x80\x9cThe president is committed to getting tax relief for middle-class Americans passed and is willing to work with Democrats and Republicans to do it,\xe2\x80\x9d the official said.  \nThe dinner comes as the Senate begins hearings this week on tax reform, an issue that Trump and Republicans in Congress promised to tackle on the campaign trail last year. \nTrump is trying to persuade Democrats to support his push to cut tax rates and simplify the tax code this year, a plan critical to bolstering Republicans heading into 2018 congressional elections. \nLast month, Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer laid out his party\xe2\x80\x99s demands for any bipartisan tax reform package in a letter to the president signed by 43 Senate Democrats and two independents. \nBut Donnelly, Heitkamp and Manchin, who face re-election in states that Trump won easily in the 2016 presidential election, did not sign it.            \nThe White House saw that as a sign that they are \xe2\x80\x9cmore open to working with us,\xe2\x80\x9d the White House official said.  \nThe dinner is the latest sign the president is willing to work with Democrats in Congress.  \nLast Wednesday, he stunned fellow Republicans by making a deal with Democrats to extend the U.S. debt limit and provide government funding until Dec. 8. \nHeitkamp also traveled with the president on Air Force One on Wednesday to a tax event in her home state. She and Manchin had been in the running for a Cabinet position earlier in Trump\xe2\x80\x99s administration.  \nTrump last week also signaled willingness to work with Democrats to end congressional battles over the debt limit. \n'

aS' If you thought the election of Donald Trump has been a gift for  comedians, think again. \nJust as news media outlets struggle to keep pace with the  controversies and personalities at Trump\xe2\x80\x99s White House, comedy writers, producers, and talk show hosts have scrambled to process material that a year ago appeared to be a comedy gold mine, but which some no longer see as a laughing matter. \n\xe2\x80\x9cPeople say, you comedians must be so happy about Trump,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miles Kahn, writer and producer on Samantha Bee\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cFull Frontal\xe2\x80\x9d television show on TBS, a unit of Time Warner Inc. \n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think any of us are. We\xe2\x80\x99re scared. We get very anxious, we\xe2\x80\x99re kept on edge and when you\xe2\x80\x99re anxious it\xe2\x80\x99s really hard to concentrate and write something funny,\xe2\x80\x9d Kahn said. \n\xe2\x80\x9cFull Frontal\xe2\x80\x9d is competing on Sunday for a variety talk series Emmy - the highest awards in television - in a tight race that includes late-night shows featuring Stephen Colbert, John Oliver and Bill Maher, who all have relentlessly attacked Trump and his policies. \nAsked about the plethora of Trump material, Bee told reporters last week, \xe2\x80\x9cAs citizens, we would actually ask for less. ... We have what we have, so we make what we can out of it.\xe2\x80\x9d \nColbert\xe2\x80\x99s skewering of Trump sent ratings soaring for his \xe2\x80\x9cThe Late Show\xe2\x80\x9d and helped win him the job of hosting Sunday\xe2\x80\x99s prime-time Emmy Awards show. \nAfter its most-watched season in 23 years, sketch show \xe2\x80\x9cSaturday Night Live,\xe2\x80\x9d got 22 Emmy nominations. Melissa McCarthy\xe2\x80\x99s impersonations of former White House press secretary Sean Spicer brought her a guest actress Emmy last Sunday, while Alec Baldwin\xe2\x80\x99s take on Trump and Kate McKinnon\xe2\x80\x99s spoofs of Trump aide Kellyanne Conway are in the race this weekend. \nIn a nation divided by the 2016 presidential election, comedy fills a vital role, even if laughter is sometimes being replaced by outrage, said Dannagal Young, associate professor of communications at the University of Delaware \n\xe2\x80\x9cComedy has a history of making light of tragedy. A lot of people are looking to these shows to make sense of the political world, to find some kinship with other people watching and in recognizing the insanity for what it is,\xe2\x80\x9d Young said. \nTV comics like Bee, Colbert, Oliver and Seth Myers, host of \xe2\x80\x9cLate Night with Seth Meyers,\xe2\x80\x9d have been so hard-hitting that their material sometimes \xe2\x80\x9ccomes close to being didactic, and not cheerful,\xe2\x80\x9d Young said. \nIn August, Meyers called Trump a \xe2\x80\x9clying racist.\xe2\x80\x9d In May, Colbert said Trump has \xe2\x80\x9cmore people marching against (him) than cancer.\xe2\x80\x9d \nWriters on topical shows are constantly being outpaced by news from the White House and Trump\xe2\x80\x99s freewheeling Twitter habit. \n\xe2\x80\x9cPretty much on a weekly basis we are throwing out something that we wanted to talk about. After we have rehearsed the show and are in rewrite, we are constantly checking the news to make sure we are not missing anything,\xe2\x80\x9d said Kahn. \nMeanwhile, shows like White House comedy series \xe2\x80\x9cVeep,\xe2\x80\x9d which is bidding for its a third Emmy, and nefarious Washington drama \xe2\x80\x9cHouse of Cards,\xe2\x80\x9d a contender for best drama series, are in danger of being sidelined. \nYoung questioned whether the once far-fetched premise of such TV shows is still compelling. \n\xe2\x80\x9cI have been a huge fan of \xe2\x80\x98House of Cards,\xe2\x80\x99 but I\xe2\x80\x99ve not even started watching the new season because I don\xe2\x80\x99t have room for the fictional version. I\xe2\x80\x98m already overflowing with the real version,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \n'

aS' At polling station no. 333 in the Russian city of Vladikavkaz, Reuters reporters only counted 256 voters casting their ballots in a regional election on Sunday. \nPeople were voting across Russia in what is seen as a dress rehearsal for next year\xe2\x80\x99s presidential vote. Kremlin candidates for regional parliaments and governorships performed strongly nationwide. \nWhen the official results for polling station no. 333 were declared, the turnout was first given as 1,331 before being revised up to 1,867 on Tuesday. That is more than seven times higher than the number of voters counted by Reuters - with 73 percent of the votes going to United Russia, the party of President Vladimir Putin. \nElection officials at the polling station said their tally was correct and there were no discrepancies.   \nReuters reporters were there when the polls opened at 08:00 until after the official count had been completed. They saw one man, who said he was a United Russia election observer, approaching the ballot box multiple times and each time putting inside voting papers. \n\xe2\x80\x9cWe must ensure 85 percent for United Russia. Otherwise, the Tsar will stop providing us with money,\xe2\x80\x9d the man, Sergei Lyutikov, told a reporter, in an apparent reference to Putin. \nPutin is the strong favorite to win re-election next year. Many voters credit him with restoring national pride. However, with the economy forecast to grow only 1 percent this year enthusiasm for Putin is not as strong as it has been. Political analysts say that could result in a weak election turnout. \nReuters reporters observed the vote at six polling stations on Sunday. At all six the reporters found discrepancies, of varying sizes, between the official vote tally and the number of voters the reporters counted. \nThe reporters were present for the entire voting day except for in one place where a reporter missed the start because they were initially not allowed in. \nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov did not immediately respond to requests for comments for this story.  \nHowever, Peskov, on a conference call with reporters on Monday, said the vote showed people trust Putin. He said that there was \xe2\x80\x9czero tolerance\xe2\x80\x9d of fraud, with reports of violations of election rules being dealt with swiftly.  \nCiting election commission data, he said the volume of complaints were down on previous elections, and in most cases the complaints were about secondary issues.    \nUnited Russia\xe2\x80\x99s party headquarters, in a statement sent to Reuters, said it gave no orders to anyone to stuff ballots or falsify results. It said all violations would be examined by election commissions and, if the law was broken, those responsible would be punished.  \nThe six polling stations the Reuters reporters visited were in three regions but there were thousands of polling stations operating in Russia on Sunday so the events only offer a small snapshot of what happened.   \nReuters reporters are unable to assess if such practices were widespread, or whether they had a material bearing on the outcome of the election.      \nOpinion polls consistently show that United Russia has more support than any other Russian party. \nGolos, a non-governmental organization whose volunteers monitored the voting in 36 regions, said late on Monday it had received reports of 825 violations of election rules. They included multiple reports of inflated turnout figures and ballot-stuffing. However, the NGO said violations were down compared to previous elections. \nRussia\xe2\x80\x99s central election commission, asked about the discrepancies witnessed by Reuters did not immediately respond. \nElla Pamfilova, chair of the commission, told a news conference after polls closed that the irregularities that had been reported to her commission would be investigated. \nAt polling station no. 333, located in a further education college in Vladikavkaz, capital of the North Ossetia region, voters on Sunday were electing a new regional parliament. \nLyutikov was there throughout the day. He works as an aide to Vadim Suanov, a United Russia deputy in the outgoing North Ossetia regional legislature, according to the legislature\xe2\x80\x99s website. Suanov, who was running for re-election on Sunday, told Reuters he knew nothing about what his employee did in the polling station. \nLyutikov cast his ballot in the first hours of voting but later inserted ballot papers about 10 times, according to the Reuters witnesses. \nLyutikov told a Reuters reporter not to document him at the ballot box, threatening to break her mobile phone if the pictures and video footage were not deleted. At one point, he showed a reporter his passport, with his name, Sergei Ivanovich Lyutikov and his date of birth, April 17 1984. \nWhile he was approaching the ballot box, he was in sight of Yelena Khadonova, the chair of the election commission for polling station no.333. \nAsked about Lyutikov\xe2\x80\x99s actions, she said: \xe2\x80\x9cI have nothing to comment on. I haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen anything.\xe2\x80\x9d  \nAt a parliamentary election last September, Reuters reporters at several polling stations found cases of inflated turnout and ballot-stuffing. Russia election chiefs said they would investigate, and the police launched their own investigation. \nAfter Sunday\xe2\x80\x99s vote, Kremlin candidates were on track to win in all 16 regions where governors were being elected, according to preliminary results. In the six regions where parliaments were being elected, including in North Ossetia, United Russia was in comfortable first place.  \nUnited Russia was less dominant in municipal elections in parts of Moscow, where support for opposition candidates is traditionally stronger. \nAt another location, polling station no. 618 in Belgorod region, a Reuters reporter accompanied election officials on their visits to voters\xe2\x80\x99 houses to administer home voting. The number of home voters was equal to about a quarter of those who voted at the polling station.     \nUnder Russia\xe2\x80\x99s electoral rules, voting at home is reserved for cases where a voter has specifically requested a visit, because for health reasons they are unable to make it to a polling station. \nKremlin opponents and independent monitors say home voting is open to abuse because it is not subject to the same scrutiny as voting in a polling station, where monitors from several parties, and journalists, are often present. \nDespite the rule that home voting is only offered on request, several of the people visited by the election officials at their homes said they had not asked to vote at home.  \nThe election officials entered most of houses without knocking on the door. One man in his sixties was smoking a cigarette in his backyard when the election officials arrived. \n\xe2\x80\x9cFirst build a road and then we\xe2\x80\x99ll talk,\xe2\x80\x9d he told the officials, pointing at a bumpy path leading to his house. He denied he asked them to come, but still cast his vote. \nThe officials said a relative or neighbor may have made the request on his behalf. \nOver the course of two hours, during which the reporter was with the officials at all times, they collected 14 filled ballot papers. When the officials returned to the polling station, they had 18 filled ballot papers. \nThe officials who made the trip said the tally was correct. The head of the election commission at polling station no. 618, Lyubov Grushko, said: \xe2\x80\x9cThe difference in numbers is a provocative issue, we won\xe2\x80\x99t discuss it.\xe2\x80\x9d     \n'

aS' Pressure mounted on Myanmar on Tuesday to end violence that has sent about 370,000 Rohingya Muslims fleeing to Bangladesh, with the United States calling for protection of civilians and Bangladesh urging safe zones to enable refugees to go home. \nBut China, which competes for influence in its southern neighbor with the United States, said it backed Myanmar\xe2\x80\x99s efforts to safeguard \xe2\x80\x9cdevelopment and stability\xe2\x80\x9d. \nThe government of Buddhist-majority Myanmar says its security forces are fighting Rohingya militants behind a surge of violence in Rakhine state that began on Aug. 25, and they are doing all they can to avoid harming civilians. \nThe government says about 400 people have been killed in the fighting, the latest in the western state. \nThe top U.N. human rights official denounced Myanmar on Monday for conducting a \xe2\x80\x9ccruel military operation\xe2\x80\x9d against Rohingya, branding it \xe2\x80\x9ca textbook example of ethnic cleansing\xe2\x80\x9d.    \nThe United States said the violent displacement of the Rohingya showed Myanmar\xe2\x80\x99s security forces were not protecting civilians. Washington has been a staunch supporter of Myanmar\xe2\x80\x99s transition from decades of harsh military rule that is being led by Nobel peace laureate Aung San Suu Kyi. \n\xe2\x80\x9cWe call on Burmese security authorities to respect the rule of law, stop the violence, and end the displacement of civilians from all communities,\xe2\x80\x9d the White House said in a statement. \nMyanmar government spokesmen were not immediately available for comment but the foreign ministry said shortly before the U.S. statement was issued that Myanmar was also concerned about the suffering. Its forces were carrying out their legitimate duty to restore order in response to acts of extremism. \n\xe2\x80\x9cThe government of Myanmar fully shares the concern of the international community regarding the displacement and suffering of all communities affected by the latest escalation of violence ignited by the acts of terrorism,\xe2\x80\x9d the ministry said in a statement. \nMyanmar\xe2\x80\x99s government regards Rohingya as illegal migrants from Bangladesh and denies them citizenship, even though many Rohingya families have lived there for generations. \nAttacks by a Rohingya insurgent group, the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA), on police posts and an army base in the north of Rakhine on Aug. 25 provoked the military counter-offensive that refugees say is aimed at pushing Rohingya out of the country. \nA similar but smaller wave of attacks by the same insurgents last October also sparked what critics called a heavy-handed response by the security forces that sent 87,000 Rohingya fleeing to Bangladesh. \nReports from refugees and rights groups paint a picture of widespread attacks on Rohingya villages in the north of Rakhine by the security forces and ethnic Rakhine Buddhists, who have put numerous Muslim villages to the torch. \nBut Myanmar authorities have denied the security forces, or Buddhist civilians, have been setting the fires, instead blaming the insurgents. Nearly 30,000 Buddhist villagers have also been displaced, they say. \n\xe2\x80\x98STOP THE VIOLENCE\xe2\x80\x99 \nThe exodus to Bangladesh shows no sign of slowing with 370,000 the latest estimate, according to a U.N. refugee agency spokeswoman, up from an estimate of 313,000 on the weekend. \nBangladesh was already home to about 400,000 Rohingyas. \nMany refugees are hungry and sick, without shelter or clean water in the middle of the rainy season. The United Nations said 200,000 children needed urgent support. \nTwo emergency flights organized by the U.N. refugee agency arrived in Bangladesh with aid for about 25,000 refugees. More flights are planned with the aim of helping 120,000, a spokesman said. \nWorry is also growing about conditions inside Rakhine State, with fears a hidden humanitarian crisis may be unfolding. \nMyanmar has rejected a ceasefire declared by ARSA to enable the delivery of aid there, saying it did not negotiate with terrorists. \nBut Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina said Myanmar should set up safe zones to enable the refugees to go home. \n\xe2\x80\x9cMyanmar will have to take back all Rohingya refugees who entered Bangladesh,\xe2\x80\x9d Hasina said on a visit to the Cox\xe2\x80\x99s Bazar border district where she distributed aid. \n\xe2\x80\x9dMyanmar has created the problem and they will have to solve it,\xe2\x80\x9c she said, adding: \xe2\x80\x9dWe want peaceful relations with our neighbors, but we can\xe2\x80\x99t accept any injustice. \n\xe2\x80\x9cStop this violence against innocent people.\xe2\x80\x9d \nMyanmar has said those who can verify their citizenship can return but most Rohingya are stateless. \nIn Beijing, Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said, \xe2\x80\x9cThe international community should support Myanmar in its efforts to safeguard development and stability.\xe2\x80\x9d \nPakistan called on Myanmar to stop making \xe2\x80\x9cunfulfilled promises\xe2\x80\x9d. \nIn a speech to the U.N. Human Rights Council in Geneva, on behalf of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation, Pakistan said, \xe2\x80\x9cDiscrimination, violence and acts of hatred are intolerable.\xe2\x80\x9d \n'

Our streets\xe2\x80\x9d during protests over the acquittal of a white former policeman who shot a black man to death in 2011. \nSeveral hundred people marched through the streets of St. Louis again on Monday evening, but rallies remained peaceful as on-and-off rain appeared to keep some protesters at home. \nMore than 120 people were arrested late Sunday, when police in riot gear used pepper spray and detained activists who defied orders to disperse following larger, peaceful protests.  \nA St. Louis Post-Dispatch photojournalist, David Carson, tweeted that he and others heard some officers chant \xe2\x80\x9cWhose streets? Our streets,\xe2\x80\x9d commandeering a refrain used by the protesters themselves.   \nA grainy video circulating online shows a group of officers  and the chant can be heard. Carson said he spoke to a police commander at the scene who said any such chant would be unacceptable and he would deal with it.  \nThe protests followed a judge\xe2\x80\x99s ruling on Friday finding the former officer, Jason Stockley, 36, not guilty of first-degree murder in the 2011 shooting death of Anthony Lamar Smith, 24. \nThe clashes evoked memories of riots following the 2014 shooting of a black teenager by a white officer in nearby Ferguson. \n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Department is aware of the video circulating on social media, and is reviewing the footage,\xe2\x80\x9d police spokeswoman Schron Jackson wrote in an email to Reuters. \xe2\x80\x9cWe hold our officers to the highest standards of professionalism and any officer not meeting those standards will be held accountable.\xe2\x80\x9d     \nSuch actions could only inflame tensions, said Nicolle Barton, executive director of the St. Louis police civilian oversight board, which is also investigating. \xe2\x80\x9cCertainly we do not want that to be taking place,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \nThe Ethical Society of Police, a group of black St. Louis police officers, tweeted on Monday there was \xe2\x80\x9cNo need 2 chant.\xe2\x80\x9d  \nWhile most protests were peaceful, some turned violent at night with some people in the streets carrying guns, bats and hammers.     \n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re in control, this is our city and we\xe2\x80\x99re going to protect it,\xe2\x80\x9d acting police commissioner Lawrence O\xe2\x80\x98Toole said on Monday.     \nThe U.S. Justice Department said on Monday it had decided a year ago there was insufficient evidence to pursue federal civil rights charges against Stockley. It held off announcing the decision to avoid influencing the trial, it said. \n'

aS' The U.S. Supreme Court on Tuesday allowed President Donald Trump to broadly implement a ban on refugees entering the country from around the world. \nThe justices granted a request from the Trump administration to block a federal appeals court decision that, according to the Justice Department, would have allowed up to 24,000 additional refugees to enter the United States than would otherwise have been eligible. \nThe Supreme Court ruling gives Trump a partial victory as the high court prepares for a key October hearing on the constitutionality of Trump\xe2\x80\x99s controversial executive order, which banned travelers from six Muslim-majority countries and limited refugee admissions.  \nThe March 6 order suspended travel for people from Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen for 90 days and locked out most aspiring refugees for 120 days in a move the Republican president argued was needed to prevent terrorist attacks and allow the government to put in place more stringent vetting procedures. \nThe order took effect in late June, following a Supreme Court ruling that narrowed the scope of lower court rulings.  \nIn a ruling last week, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said grandparents, aunts, uncles and cousins of legal U.S. residents would be exempt from the travel ban. \nThe Justice Department opted not to appeal that part of the 9th Circuit decision. \nHowever, the 9th Circuit also ruled that Trump\xe2\x80\x99s refugee policy was too broad, and the court allowed entry to refugees from around the world if they had a formal offer from a resettlement agency.  \nThe Justice Department appealed, and the full Supreme Court on Tuesday sided with the administration in a one-sentence order. \nNaureen Shah, Amnesty International USA\xe2\x80\x99s senior director of campaigns, said the refugee ban is inherently cruel. \n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Supreme Court today has dealt yet another devastating blow to vulnerable people who were on the cusp of obtaining safety for themselves and their families,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cThey continue to be subjected to unimaginable violence and fear while their lives are in limbo.\xe2\x80\x9d \nEarlier on Tuesday the state of Hawaii, which challenged the policy, said in a court filing that the U.S. government could still \xe2\x80\x9cbar tens of thousands of refugees from entering the country.\xe2\x80\x9d All the 9th Circuit ruling did is \xe2\x80\x9cprotect vulnerable refugees and the American entities that have been eagerly preparing to welcome them to our shores,\xe2\x80\x9d Hawaii\xe2\x80\x99s lawyers added. \nHawaii Attorney General Doug Chin said he respected the Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision and is preparing for the hearing there on Oct. 10.  \n'

aS' U.S. President Donald Trump\xe2\x80\x99s meeting on Tuesday evening with a bipartisan group of senators to discuss tax reform \xe2\x80\x9cwas highly productive, and will spur constructive discussion moving forward,\xe2\x80\x9d the White House said in a statement on Wednesday. \nTrump, who is pushing his overall goals of a simpler tax code with lower rates even as a detailed plan has yet to emerge, is also scheduled to hold another bipartisan meeting later on Wednesday at the White House. \n'

aS' Police and spy chiefs from China to the Middle East, a Ukrainian oligarch and a former president of Panama are among the people a coalition of human rights groups wants targeted for sanctions under an expanded U.S. law aimed at curbing rights abuses and corruption worldwide. \nThe coalition, in documents to be made public on Wednesday, submitted 15 cases to the U.S. State Department and U.S. Treasury, urging them to investigate using the law, called the  Global Magnitsky Act. \nThe law, which then-President Barack Obama signed in December 2016, expands the scope of 2012 legislation that froze the assets of Russian officials and banned them from traveling to the United States because of their links to the 2009 death in prison of a whistleblower, Sergey Magnitsky. \n\xe2\x80\x9cThe cases we have elected to highlight come from every region of the world, and involve horrific stories of torture, enforced disappearance, murder, sexual assault, extortion and bribery,\xe2\x80\x9d the coalition of 23 groups said in a letter to U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. \nThe groups said their information came from first-hand accounts of victims and their attorneys, investigative journalism and reports by non-governmental organizations (NGOs). \n(\n) \nPolice chiefs, public prosecutors and heads of security services in Bahrain, China, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Mexico and Central Asian countries where prisoners were tortured, executed or died in custody are on the list compiled by the groups, which are coordinated by Washington-based Human Rights First. \nAmong them are Chinese Deputy Minister of Public Security Fu Zhenghua and Beijing\xe2\x80\x99s Municipal Public Security Bureau deputy head Tao Jing. The groups accuse the two officials of bearing \xe2\x80\x9ccommand responsibility\xe2\x80\x9d for actions of forces under their control in the torture and 2014 death of human rights activist Cao Shunli. \nCao\xe2\x80\x99s lawyer has said she was denied medical treatment until she was seriously ill, which the Chinese government denies.  \nDmitry Firtash, a Ukrainian oligarch indicted by a U.S. court in 2013 on bribery and other charges, is on the list. He denies wrongdoing and is fighting extradition from Austria. Another target is former Panamanian president Ricardo Martinelli, who is jailed in Florida facing extradition to Panama on charges he conducted illegal surveillance and stole state funds while in office. Martinelli has repeatedly denied the charges. \nPresident Donald Trump, a Republican who did not stress global human rights as a foreign policy priority during his presidential campaign or early months in office, told Congress in April that he was committed to \xe2\x80\x9crobust and thorough implementation\xe2\x80\x9d of the Magnitsky law. \nHis administration has yet to impose sanctions or travel bans under it, but an official said the process of identifying potential targets \xe2\x80\x9cis both internal and external. We have received nominations from multiple sources including the United States Congress and NGOs.\xe2\x80\x9d \n\xe2\x80\x9cEvidence permitting, our objective is to leverage the global reach of this authority and pursue geographically diverse \xe2\x80\x98tranches\xe2\x80\x99 of targets on an ongoing basis,\xe2\x80\x9d said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. \nActing on the recommendations could pose risks for Trump if targeted governments retaliated. Washington needs Beijing\xe2\x80\x99s help in pressuring North Korea to halt its missile and nuclear tests, for example. \nThe original Magnitsky legislation strained relations between Moscow and Washington. Magnitsky, a tax accountant and lawyer, was arrested in 2008 shortly after accusing Russian officials of involvement in fraud, and died in prison nearly a year later while awaiting trial. \nWilliam Browder, whose Russian hedge fund employed Magnitsky as a lawyer, spearheaded an international campaign to push through the original Magnitsky Act, which now covers 44 Russians. He said travel bans and asset freezes are effective. \n\xe2\x80\x9cIt creates a very devastating consequence because people who thought they could act with absolute impunity no longer have that comfort,\xe2\x80\x9d Browder said. \nThe human rights coalition also hopes that pressure from politicians such as Republican Senator John McCain and Democratic Senator Ben Cardin, the authors of the original legislation and the update, will spur the Trump administration into action. \nMcCain, in a statement to Reuters, said the role of NGOs is crucial, and envisioned under the new law. \xe2\x80\x9cI will continue working to ensure the administration enforces the law and utilizes this powerful tool to advance freedom and justice around the world,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \nRob Berschinski, a former Obama administration official who led the efforts at Human Rights First, said, \xe2\x80\x9cOur process is designed to assist the government, but also to remove any excuse around whether it has the ability to levy sanctions. Now the question is simply one of political will.\xe2\x80\x9d \nThe Global Magnitsky Act requires the Trump administration to report to Congress by Dec. 10 on sanctions it has imposed under the law. \n'

aS' Myanmar\xe2\x80\x99s national leader Aung San Suu Kyi, facing outrage over violence that has forced about 400,000 Rohingya Muslims to flee to Bangladesh, canceled a trip to the upcoming U.N. General Assembly because of the crisis, her office said on Wednesday. \nThe exodus of refugees, sparked by the security forces\xe2\x80\x99 fierce response to a series of Rohingya militant attacks, is the most pressing problem Suu Kyi has faced since becoming leader last year.  \nCritics have called for her to be stripped of her Nobel peace prize for failing to do more to halt the strife which the U.N. rights agency said was a \xe2\x80\x9ctextbook example of ethnic cleansing\xe2\x80\x9d. \nAid agencies will have to step up operations \xe2\x80\x9cmassively\xe2\x80\x9d in response to the refugee flow to Bangladesh, a senior U.N. official said, adding that the $77 million the United Nations had appealed for last week would not be enough. \nBut a Bangladeshi border force officer said the number of people crossing into his area had fallen sharply, apparently because everyone had left the districts worst hit by violence. \nSuu Kyi, in her first address to the U.N. General Assembly as leader in September last year, defended her government\xe2\x80\x99s efforts to resolve the crisis over treatment of the Muslim minority. \nThis year, she canceled her trip to New York because of the security threats posed by the insurgents and the need to restore stability, Zaw Htay, spokesman for Suu Kyi\xe2\x80\x99s office, told a media briefing. \n\xe2\x80\x9cShe is concentrating on establishing stability,\xe2\x80\x9d the spokesman said, adding that preventing any spread of communal violence was a priority and Suu Kyi would address the nation on reconciliation and peace next Tuesday. \nInternational pressure has been growing on Buddhist-majority Myanmar to end the violence in the western state of Rakhine that began on Aug. 25 when Rohingya militants attacked 30 police posts and an army camp. \nThe raids triggered a sweeping military counter-offensive against the insurgents, whom the government labels terrorists. Refugees say the offensive is aimed at pushing Rohingya out of Myanmar. \nNumerous Rohingya villages in the north of Rakhine state have been torched but authorities have denied that security forces or Buddhist civilians have been setting the fires. Instead, they blame the insurgents.  \nIn the latest violence reported by the government, the insurgents attacked and burned three police posts in the north of Rakhine on Tuesday. There were no reports of casualties. \nThe Trump administration has called for protection of civilians, and Bangladesh says all the refugees will have to go home and has called for safe zones in Myanmar. Zaw Htay said safe zones were not acceptable. \nChina, which competes with the United States for influence in Asia, said on Tuesday it backed Myanmar\xe2\x80\x99s efforts to safeguard \xe2\x80\x9cdevelopment and stability\xe2\x80\x9d. \nThe U.N. Security Council is to meet on Wednesday behind closed doors for the second time since the crisis erupted. British U.N. Ambassador Matthew Rycroft said he hoped there would be a public statement agreed by the council. \nMyanmar\xe2\x80\x99s military, which ruled for almost 50 years until it began a transition to democracy in 2011, retains significant political powers and has full control of security.  \nNevertheless, critics say Suu Kyi could speak out against the violence and demand respect for the rule of law. \nBut anti-Rohingya sentiment is common in Myanmar, where Buddhist nationalism has surged since the end of military rule. \nSuu Kyi, whom the military blocked from becoming president and who says Myanmar is at the beginning of the road to democracy, could risk being denounced as unpatriotic if she were seen to be criticizing a military operation that enjoys widespread support. \nA mob in central Myanmar threw stones at Muslim shops on Sunday but there have been no serious outbreaks elsewhere.  \nZaw Htay said the government had information about plots to launch attacks, although he did not elaborate, except to say security was being tightened in cities.  \nThose fears will be compounded by an al Qaeda call to arms in support of the Rohingya. \n\xe2\x80\x9cThe savage treatment meted out to our Muslim brothers ... shall not pass without punishment,\xe2\x80\x9d al Qaeda said in a statement, the SITE monitoring group said.  \nBangladesh was already home to about 400,000 Rohingya who fled earlier conflict and many of the new refugees, hungry and sick, are without shelter or clean water. \n\xe2\x80\x9cWe will all have to ramp up our response massively, from food to shelter,\xe2\x80\x9d George William Okoth-Obbo, assistant high commissioner for operations at the U.N. refugee agency, told Reuters during a visit to the Kutupalong camp in Bangladesh.      \nHe declined to say how many people he thought might come but Bangladeshi officer Lieutenant Colonel Ariful Islam said numbers were falling off sharply in his area. \n\xe2\x80\x9cThe people who arrived in the early days after the atrocities, now they\xe2\x80\x99ve come out,\xe2\x80\x9d Islam told Reuters. \n'

aS' A mysterious Syrian wheat purchase signed last October with a little-known Russian trader has formally been called off, a government source has told Reuters. \nWar-torn Syria had sought 1 million tonnes of wheat from trader Zernomir to feed government-held territories and prevent bread shortages. \nWheat exporter Russia supports Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in the country\xe2\x80\x99s six-year-old war and has helped the government with wheat aid. \nBut there was scepticism about the ability of Zernomir to deliver on the deal from the start.  \n\xe2\x80\x9cThe deal was canceled due to difficulties in banking operations and execution,\xe2\x80\x9d the government source said.  \nA Russian agriculture ministry official had told Reuters the main problem was that the supplier lacked experience and had set the price too low.  \nState grain buyer the General Authority for Cereal Processing and Trade (Hoboob) instead signed contracts in February with local traders for around 1.2 million tonnes of Russian wheat.    \n\xe2\x80\x9cWe now have within our hands a lot of the quantities from those contracts and we will also evaluate the situation and see whether we need to go back to the market through tenders,\xe2\x80\x9d the source said.  \nFlat bread is a subsidized staple in Syria, where war is estimated to have killed several hundred thousand people and forced millions to flee their homes. \nHoboob has not named the Syrian firms that are helping it buy Russian wheat.  \nRussian customs data shows Russia supplied 125,200 tonnes of wheat to Syria in 2016/17, up from 47,000 tonnes in 2015/16. \nSyria\xe2\x80\x99s strategic wheat reserves stand at six months\xe2\x80\x99 worth versus just 17 days of reserves last year, Internal Trade and Consumer Protection Minister Abdullah al-Gharb said last month.  \n'

aS' A former Vietnamese official who Germany says was kidnapped in Berlin to face charges in Hanoi over financial losses at a state construction firm had been cleared of wrongdoing by the previous government, according to documents seen by Reuters. \nThe decision to re-open the case and aggressively pursue prosecution shows the tougher stance taken by the ruling Communist Party since Vietnam\xe2\x80\x99s security establishment emerged stronger from a power struggle last year in which ex-Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung lost out.  \nThe party says it wants to tackle corruption but some critics have accused Vietnam\xe2\x80\x99s rulers of embarking on a witch-hunt following the launch of investigations implicating increasingly senior figures. \nThe internal crackdown drew global attention last month when Germany accused Hanoi of kidnapping Trinh Xuan Thanh, a former official with state oil firm PetroVietnam. \nHe was accused of financial mismanagement that caused losses of $150 million at PetroVietnam Construction (PVC) during the time he served as chairman from 2009 to 2013. \nBut according to a letter dated May 18, 2015 from then trade minister Vu Huy Hoang to then Prime Minister Dung, the official had stated his responsibility but the government had not \xe2\x80\x9cfound negative signs\xe2\x80\x9d relating to his actions. \n\xe2\x80\x9cTherefore, authorized agencies and units agreed not to take disciplinary action over Thanh,\xe2\x80\x9d it said, noting that he had moved to a role at the trade ministry, where he had worked hard to try to resolve the problems at PetroVietnam Construction. \n\xe2\x80\x9cCorrective work and post-inspection handling of PVC were done effectively and in accordance with the prime minister\xe2\x80\x99s requirements,\xe2\x80\x9d the letter said. \nResponding to questions about the letter and whether there would be further prosecutions over the case, Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Le Thi Thu Hang said the party and state were resolute in dealing with corruption or lawbreaking by any organization or individual. \n\xe2\x80\x9cBased on the results of the investigation, the functional agencies shall strictly handle those who violate the law in accordance with the provisions of Vietnamese law,\xe2\x80\x9d she told Reuters. \nReuters was unable to contact Thanh, former trade minister Hoang or former prime minister Dung either directly or through government offices. \nThanh ran PetroVietnam Construction, a subsidiary of a sprawling state enterprise that is also involved in everything from oil and gas to power generation, ship building and insurance. \nAfter his return to Vietnam, Thanh was shown on state television saying that he had decided to surrender himself in order to face justice. The government has not said how he returned home. \nThanh was a relatively junior figure among those who are under investigation in relation to PetroVietnam\xe2\x80\x99s dealings as well as in the banking sector. \nThe most senior political casualty so far is Dinh La Thang, a former PetroVietnam chairman who was sacked from his role in the politburo. A vice-minister who had been responsible for appointing Thanh has also been sacked. \nHoang has also been symbolically stripped of his title of former trade minister for violating state and party rules. \nInvestigations continue into PetroVietnam and the trade ministry which oversaw it as well as into the central bank. \nThere are widespread expectations that more members of Dung\xe2\x80\x99s administration will be prosecuted. \nDung lost out last year in the battle to secure the post of Communist Party General Secretary, Vietnam\xe2\x80\x99s most powerful position. \nThe post remained in the hands of Nguyen Phu Trong, whose modest public profile contrasts with the conspicuous wealth that some members of Dung\xe2\x80\x99s administration displayed. \n\xe2\x80\x9cFighting and preventing corruption, waste and negativity are no longer handled slowly and case by case. It has become a movement,\xe2\x80\x9d Trong said in July. \nAccording to a survey by Transparency International conducted between July 2015 and January 2017, Vietnam had become the most bribery prone country in Asia after India and a majority of Vietnamese believed corruption had worsened. \n'

aS' YuMi the humanoid robot showed no signs of nerves on Tuesday night as it raised its baton to conduct the Lucca Philharmonic orchestra alongside Italian tenor Andrea Bocelli. \nThe two-armed robot, designed by Swiss firm ABB, made its debut at Pisa\xe2\x80\x99s Verdi Theatre to mark the First International Festival of Robotics in the Tuscan city. \n\xe2\x80\x9cWe basically had to find time to understand his movements. When we found the way, everything was pretty easy,\xe2\x80\x9d said the orchestra\xe2\x80\x99s resident conductor, Andrea Colombini. \n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is absolutely fantastic. And the technicians were fantastic just to make everything perfect, especially in the length and in the speed of the gesture, which is very important,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \nYuMi, whose name is derived from the phrase \xe2\x80\x98you and me\xe2\x80\x99, was taught all the movements by Colombini, who held its arms in rehearsals so the computer could memorize the correct gestures. The robot is not able to improvise and any unexpected change in tempo from the musicians would have been ruinous. \nThe robot conducted three of the 18 pieces performed on Tuesday night, including the famous aria La Donna e\xe2\x80\x99 Mobile, from Verdi\xe2\x80\x99s opera Rigoletto. \n'

aS'President Trump clearly inherited an economy on the upswing, according to the 2016 Census report, with income, health coverage and poverty levels having all improved in the past two years.\nThe question is whether his administration and the Republican-controlled Congress will sustain the momentum, or even reverse it.\nThe \n, \n, showed median income, adjusted for inflation, grew by 3.2 percent from 2015 to 2106, to $59,039, as employers added jobs and hours and even, in some cases, gave raises. At the same time, the poverty rate decreased by 0.8 percentage points, or 2.5 million people, to 12.7 percent. Both measures are now at or near their prerecession levels in 2007, a hard-fought recovery.\nOn health care, the data show that the ranks of the uninsured fell last year by 900,000 people, to an all-time low of 8.8 percent of the population. The decline is a result of the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare. The 32 states and District of Columbia that participate in the A.C.A.\xe2\x80\x99s expansion of Medicaid for low-income families had larger declines in their uninsured populations than states that do not participate. Massachusetts, for example, a pioneer in broad coverage, has the lowest uninsured rate in the nation, 2.5 percent, while Texas, which rejected Medicaid expansion, has the highest, 16.6 percent.\nThe data also show the success of federal safety-net programs. If not for tax credits for low-income workers, an additional 8.2 million people would have been classified as poor last year. Similarly, food stamps and low-income housing aid lifted 3.6 million and 3.1 million people, respectively, out of poverty last year.\nFor all the improvement, however, broad prosperity remains elusive. For income gains to meaningfully raise living standards, they would have had to exceed the peak from before the recession, not merely met it. One in eight Americans, 40.6 million people, are still poor. Some 28.1 million are still without health coverage.\nAnd yet, Republican policy makers seem determined to undo the progress that has been made. The Trump administration has opposed Obama-era rules to update the nation\xe2\x80\x99s overtime-pay protections for salaried workers, arguably the single most important policy option to raise middle-class pay. President Trump and the House Budget Committee have both issued budget proposals for 2018 that call for deep spending cuts to safety-net programs. This week, the Republican senators Bill Cassidy of Louisiana and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina plan to introduce yet another draconian bill to end Obamacare.\nThose giant steps backward would all shift income up the economic ladder. They would also create fiscal room for big tax cuts for the rich, a grail of Republican policy, despite the poor job and wage growth after the tax cuts of the George W. Bush era.\nThe result would be greater income inequality, the one measure that did not improve in the new Census data. Income gains at the top far outstripped those at the bottom.\nRepublicans\xe2\x80\x99 policies would undermine the gains of average Americans. Incompetence and public opposition have limited their success so far. They will not give up, though, so neither can the opposition.\n'

aS'The range of problems facing the United States abroad is daunting: a volatile Middle East, an unpredictable, mischievous Russia, a truly menacing North Korea. To say nothing of destabilizing global challenges like the mass migration of desperate refugees, and climate change. President Trump\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cAmerica First\xe2\x80\x9d approach, which calls for disengagement from old alliances and responsibilities, is a dodge, not an answer. What\xe2\x80\x99s needed is a robust foreign policy led by a reinvigorated State Department that right now is suffering from presidential neglect, poor leadership and an absence of professional firepower in pivotal positions.\nTwo people who understand the urgency of helping the department recover from the damages inflicted by Mr. Trump are Senators Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, and Patrick Leahy, Democrat of Vermont. Leading members of the Senate Appropriations Committee, they have sought to rally their colleagues around a bipartisan spending bill for 2018 that would strengthen the department and replenish important foreign aid programs.\nLast week, the two \n for a $51 billion bill for the \n, about $11 billion more than the administration requested. While the total is less than what Congress allocated for 2017, and less than necessary given the international challenges, it\xe2\x80\x99s nowhere near the 30 percent cut that Mr. Trump; his budget chief, Mick Mulvaney; and his secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, had absurdly insisted was imperative.\nAs interesting as the bipartisan vote was the Republican-led committee\xe2\x80\x99s report, which pulled no punches in blistering Mr. Trump and his aides for \n in May that amounted to an \xe2\x80\x9capparent doctrine of retreat\xe2\x80\x9d from the world. \xe2\x80\x9cThe lessons learned since September 11, 2001, include the reality that defense alone does not provide for American strength and resolve abroad,\xe2\x80\x9d the report said. \xe2\x80\x9cBattlefield technology and firepower cannot replace diplomacy and development.\xe2\x80\x9d\nThat argument strikes at the heart of Mr. Trump\xe2\x80\x99s approach, which favors warlike rhetoric and a reliance on the Pentagon as the primary levers of American power, while negotiation and diplomacy are given short shrift. At more than $600 billion annually, the military budget accounts for almost \n of the federal budget, and Mr. Trump would add billions more for additional Navy ships and nuclear weapons. The State Department and its foreign aid programs account for 1 percent of the overall budget.\nSixteen years of war against terrorists in Afghanistan, Iraq and elsewhere have given the military what it and many others see as a priority claim on federal dollars, leaving the State Department in a subsidiary role. Mr. Trump reinforced that trend with his proposed budget cuts, which would eliminate more than 2,500 diplomatic and development jobs and make major reductions in diplomatic security (36 percent in budget cuts), H.I.V./AIDS programs (17 percent), international disaster assistance and food aid (a whopping 77 percent) and migration and refugee assistance (18 percent). When the \xe2\x80\x9cunjustified\xe2\x80\x9d budget cuts were announced, the committee report said, they caused so much concern in foreign capitals that China and Russia were able to \xe2\x80\x9chijack our national security narrative\xe2\x80\x9d as a commanding and confident power capable of leading the world.\nThe committee bill would rescind many of these reductions and go beyond the numbers by imposing unprecedented restrictions to protect certain programs and operations from administrative meddling. The number of Foreign Service officer positions, for example, would not be permitted to go below 14,000; and the State Department\xe2\x80\x99s Bureau of Population, Refugees and Migration could not be eliminated.\nThere are two reasons for these rules. Senators were angered that Mr. Mulvaney arbitrarily took a meat ax to the State Department budget without understanding its programs or the consequences of reductions and without adequate consultation with Congress. There is also grave bipartisan concern about whether Mr. Tillerson, a former Exxon Mobil chief executive with no government experience, is over his head and, indeed, whether the reorganization he has promised will end up further weakening the department. The secretary is widely seen as lacking influence with Mr. Trump; often eclipsed on the world stage by the ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki Haley; accessible only to a small coterie of aides; and detached from an increasingly demoralized diplomatic corps. Many senior people have already left their jobs in an institution that many once saw as the government\xe2\x80\x99s crown jewel.\nLike all institutions, the department can benefit from improvements. But there is no sign that Mr. Trump and his team understand its core mission and its importance in a turbulent world. With their bill, Mr. Graham, Mr. Leahy and their fellow committee members have ringingly reaffirmed that mission. The rest of Congress should ensure that a strong version of it becomes law.\n'

aS' Parts of Florida inched back toward normalcy on Wednesday with workers restoring power, clearing roads and replenishing gas supplies, even as scenes of destruction emerged from southernmost islands and new dangers emerged for residents without electricity.\nResidents drifted back from shelters and out-of-state hotels to see Hurricane Irma\'s scattershot destruction. Positive signs included some curfews being lifted, flights resuming and grocery stores reopening. But flooded streets remained, and the count of damaged and totaled homes ticked upward.\n"Everything\'s gone," said Jen Gilreath, a 33-year-old bartender whose Jacksonville home filled with knee-high floodwaters.\nWhile people around the state waited for power to be restored, a new hazard developed: carbon monoxide poisoning from generators. Authorities said that five people died and more than a dozen were treated for breathing fumes from the temporary power sources in separate instances in the Orlando, Miami and Daytona Beach areas.\nOne Miami-area apartment building was evacuated after authorities determined a lack of power made it unsafe for elderly tenants, while officers arrived at another retirement community to help people stranded on upper floors without access to working elevators. Elsewhere, a South Florida townhouse that weathered the storm was gutted by fire when power was restored, causing the stove to ignite items left on the cooktop.\nAs crews labored to repair the lone highway connecting the Keys, residents of some of the islands closest to Florida\'s mainland returned to get their first look at the devastation two days after Irma roared in with 130 mph (209 kph) winds.\nFederal Emergency Management Agency administrator Brock Long said preliminary estimates suggested that 25 percent of the homes in the Keys were destroyed and 65 percent sustained major damage.\n"Basically, every house in the Keys was impacted," he said.\nThe number of deaths blamed on Irma in Florida climbed to 13 with the carbon monoxide deaths, in addition to four in South Carolina and two in Georgia. At least 37 people were killed in the Caribbean.\n"We\'ve got a lot of work to do, but everybody\'s going to come together," Florida Gov. Rick Scott said. "We\'re going to get this state rebuilt."\nGlimpses of Irma\'s economic toll were emerging, with Florida saying 31 state agencies had already amassed nearly $250 million in preparation and recovery expenses. In the meantime, officials warily eyed storm damage to its citrus crops, an issue Sens. Bill Nelson and Marco Rubio planned to address at a joint news conference Wednesday morning with growers.\nThe number of people without electricity in the steamy late-summer heat dropped to 9.5 million \xe2\x80\x94 just under half of Florida\'s population. Utility officials warned it could take 10 days or more for power to be fully restored. About 110,000 people remained in shelters across the state.\nIn hard-hit Naples, on Florida\'s southwest coast, more than 300 people stood outside a Publix grocery store Tuesday, waiting for it to open.\nAt the front of the line after a more than two-hour wait, Phill Chirchirillo, 57, said days without electricity and other basics were beginning to wear on people.\n"At first it\'s like, \'We\'re safe, thank God.\' Now they\'re testy," he said. "The order of the day is to keep people calm."\nWhile nearly all of Florida was engulfed by the 400-mile-wide (645-kilometer) storm, the Keys \xe2\x80\x94 home to about 70,000 people \xe2\x80\x94 appeared to be the hardest hit. Drinking water and power were cut off, all three of the islands\' hospitals were closed, and the supply of gasoline was extremely limited.\nSearch-and-rescue teams made their way into the more distant reaches of the Keys, and an aircraft carrier was positioned off Key West to help. Officials said it was not known how many people ignored evacuation orders and stayed behind in the Keys.\nCrews also worked to repair two washed-out, 300-foot (90-meter) sections of U.S. 1, the highway that runs through the Keys, and check the safety of the 42 bridges linking the islands.\nIn Islamorada, a trailer park was devastated, the homes ripped apart as if by a giant claw. A sewage-like stench hung over the place.\nDebris was scattered everywhere, including refrigerators, washers and dryers, a 25-foot (8-meter) fishing boat and a Jacuzzi. Homes were torn open to give a glimpse of their contents, including a bedroom with a small Christmas tree decorated with starfish.\nOne man and his family came to check on a weekend home and found it destroyed. The sight was too much to bear. The man told his family to get back in the car, and they drove off toward Miami.\nThe Lower Keys \xe2\x80\x94 including the chain\'s most distant and most populous island, Key West, with 27,000 people \xe2\x80\x94 were still off-limits, with a roadblock in place where the highway was washed out.\nAlthough the Keys are studded with mansions and beachfront resorts, about 13 percent of the people live in poverty and could face big obstacles as the cleanup begins.\n"People who bag your groceries when you\'re on vacation \xe2\x80\x94 the bus drivers, hotel cleaners, cooks and dishwashers \xe2\x80\x94 they\'re already living beyond paycheck to paycheck," said Stephanie Kaple, who runs an organization that helps the homeless in the Keys.\nOn the mainland, one of the evacuees taken from the Coral Gables apartment building that lacked power was a 97-year-old woman who is immobile and has heart problems.\nFive firefighters went up the dark emergency stairwell, strapped Cuban-born Ofelia Carrillo to a special evacuation chair and carried her down. Her daughter Madeleine Alvarez said they ultimately heeded firefighters\' isntructions, despite doctors warning of her mother\'s fragile state.\n"This is the most stressful situation I\'ve lived in my life," Alvarez said.\n'

aS' Nearing the end of a sweeping visit to assess the devastation wrought by Hurricane Irma, French President Emmanuel Macron has promised to rebuild the wrecked island of St. Martin and diversify its economy from a sole reliance on tourism.\nMacron stayed overnight on St. Martin, reportedly sleeping on a camp cot. He was heading to the heavily damaged island of St. Barts Wednesday with the French health minister, who has warned about diseases spreading on the islands after water supplies, electricity and communication were knocked out for days.\nIn further responses to complaints that his government didn\'t do enough to handle Irma\'s wrath, Macron also pledged to evacuate residents of his country\'s Caribbean territories and provide services and shelter for those who choose to stay.\n"What we have seen today are people determined to rebuild and return to a normal life," Macron said Tuesday. "They are impatient for answers and some are very, very angry. The anger is legitimate because it is a result of the fear they have faced and of being very fatigued. It is certain that some want to leave, and we will help them in that effort."\nHe said France was bringing in air-conditioned tents so children can start classes again soon, and that a center would be established by Monday to begin processing requests for financial help.\nMacron pledged to rebuild St. Martin as a "model island" that would be a "showcase of French excellence."\n"I don\'t want to rebuild St. Martin as it was," he said. "We have seen there are many homes that were built too precariously, with fragile infrastructure. The geography of the homes was not adapted to the risks."\nMacron said the Category 5 hurricane killed 11 people in St. Martin, while another four people died on the Dutch side of the island, bringing the death toll in the Caribbean to at least 37.\nThe president was joined in the region by British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, whose itinerary focused on the badly damaged British Virgin Islands and Anguilla. Johnson also defended the British government following criticism that it had failed to provide enough help to British Overseas Territories devastated by the storm.\nIn London, Prime Minister Theresa May told Parliament an additional 25 million pounds ($33 million) would be spent on recovery efforts as Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson oversaw early aid efforts in Anguilla.\nJohnson told Anguilla governor Tim Foy Tuesday night that his visit is meant to show the U.K.\'s commitment.\n"It is clear this place has been through an absolutely hellish experience, and it is no doubt at all that you need help with power generation, with getting the hospital back up and running, getting the airport back up and running, and schools properly set \xe2\x80\x94 all kinds of things need to be done," Johnson said.\nHe said 1,000 British troops are in place to help residents and several hundred more are on the way. Britain also has a landing ship in place on the British Virgin Islands to help bring in heavy equipment and the Royal Navy warship Ocean is on the way, though it won\'t arrive from Gibraltar for about 10 days.\nSome 60 British police officers are also helping restore order in the British Virgin Islands, where roughly 100 prisoners escaped after the hurricane.\nThe visits came as residents tried to revive a sense of normalcy with small gestures like sharing radios and rescuing dogs.\nThe Dutch Red Cross said more than 200 people were still listed as missing on St. Maarten, but with communications extremely spotty a week after the storm hit, it wasn\'t clear how many were simply without cell service and power and unable to let friends and family know they survived. The organization said 90 percent of buildings on the Dutch territory were damaged and a third destroyed as Irma roared across the island it shares with French St. Martin.\nYogesh Bodha, a jewelry store employee, said there was no response from European officials for two days and he hasn\'t seen many changes since Dutch authorities arrived on St. Maarten.\n"They should\'ve been more organized than they were," he said. "We have not received any food or water. They say it\'s on its way. Let\'s see."\nFor Liseth Echevarria, who works as a bartender in St. Maarten, offering whatever she could to family, strangers and abandoned pets was helping her cope \xe2\x80\x94 and those around her were doing the same.\nThe manager of a marina next door threw over a hose so Echevarria and her husband could have a semblance of an outdoor shower. He also offered them a temporary power connection from his generator so they could charge phones and listen to the sole radio station still broadcasting.\n"This is the only communication that St. Maarten has with the world right now," she said.\nIt was thanks to that radio station that she found out about a flight for all Latin Americans stuck in St. Maarten. She rushed to the airport with her brother, who was evacuating back to Colombia. As she dropped him off, Echevarria saw a Yorkshire terrier tied to a metal barricade, abandoned by a passenger fleeing the island and told they couldn\'t bring pets on the plane.\nEchevarria scooped up the dog named Oliver and took him home to meet her three other dogs, including one rescued from a neighbor\'s property. The neighbor fled with her son after the hurricane destroyed their home. There was nothing left of it other than jagged pieces of wood and a shower curtain covered in colorful butterflies tangled in a toppled tree.\nEchevarria\'s husband, Lex Kools, a civil engineer, jumps over the fence every day to feed the other two dogs on the property.\n"They were attacking each other, they were so hungry," he said.\nAt Echevarria\'s and Kools\' home, the couple fed relatives and the girlfriend and two children of Echevarria\'s cousin, all of whom were staying with them.\nNear the front door, a large plastic table sagged under the weight of boxes of spaghetti and cookies, soup cans, chips, bags of almonds and macadamia nuts and rice. Underneath were dozens of bottles of water.\nThe couple said they took the goods from a grocery store blown open during the storm.\nThey said they had planned on buying the items, but no one was working at the store and they were running out of food and water. They looked at each other as they observed looting.\n"Do we do this as well?" Kools recalled thinking. "Everybody was just running inside. It was chaos."\n'

aS' Americans would get health coverage simply by showing a new government-issued card and would no longer owe out-of-pocket expenses like deductibles, according to legislation Sen. Bernie Sanders released Wednesday.\nBut the Vermont independent\'s description of the legislation omitted specifics about how much it would cost and final decisions about how he would pay for it.\nSanders was releasing his bill on the same day Republican senators were rolling out details of a last-ditch effort to repeal and replace President Barack Obama\'s health care law.\nIn an interview, Sanders said Tuesday that his measure would likely be paid for in a "progressive way." Aides said it would likely be financed by income-adjusted premiums people would pay the government, ranging from no premiums for the poorest Americans to high levies on the rich and corporations.\nThe measure has no chance of becoming law with President Donald Trump in the White House and Republicans controlling Congress. But it embodies a push to universal coverage that eluded Obama\'s 2010 law and is a tenet of the Democratic Party\'s liberal, activist base.\n"I think in a democracy, we should be doing what the American people want," Sanders said, citing polls showing growing support for the concept.\nHis bill would expand Medicare, the health insurance program for the elderly, to cover all Americans. It would be phased in over four years, and people and businesses would no longer owe premiums to insurers.\nThe progressive wing of the Democratic Party backs the bill, which would make health care less expensive and less complicated for many people and businesses. It would cover the 28 million Americans remaining uninsured despite Obama\'s law.\nBut some Democrats fear Sanders is exposing them to a lose-lose choice.\nDon\'t support Sanders\' plan and Democrats risk alienating the party\'s liberal, activist voters, volunteers and contributors. Back it and they\'ll be accused by Republicans of backing a huge tax increase and government-run health care, and taking away employer-provided coverage for half the country that many people like.\nAt least 12 other Senate Democrats signed onto Sanders\' bill by late Tuesday, including four potential 2020 presidential contenders besides Sanders: Kamala Harris of California, Massachusetts\' Elizabeth Warren, New York\'s Kirsten Gillibrand and Cory Booker of New Jersey.\nTo cover themselves, several Democrats are introducing their own bills that expand coverage without going as far as Sanders, including possible presidential aspirants Sens. Chris Murphy of Connecticut and Ohio\'s Sherrod Brown. Several Democrats facing tough re-elections next year in GOP-leaning states say they want to focus on strengthening Obama\'s existing law, including Montana\'s Jon Tester and Missouri\'s Claire McCaskill.\n"We welcome the Democrats\' strategy of moving even further left," said Katie Martin, spokeswoman for the Senate GOP\'s campaign organization.\nSeven weeks after the GOP drive to uproot Obama\'s 2010 health care law crashed in the Senate, two Republican senators, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Louisiana\'s Bill Cassidy, were releasing their plan for trying again.\nThey\'ve struggled for weeks to round up sufficient support for the package. It would cut and reshape Medicaid, disperse money spent under Obama\'s law directly to states and erase Obama\'s penalties on people who don\'t purchase coverage.\nNo. 3 Senate GOP leader John Thune of South Dakota said Graham and Cassidy would need "a double-double bank shot" to prevail, a joking reference to an impossible basketball shot.\nLike the failed Senate GOP repeal effort in July, the Graham-Cassidy push will get zero Democratic support. That means Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., will need 50 of the 52 Republican senators, a margin he couldn\'t reach in July and is struggling to reach now.\nDespite badgering by Trump that he keep trying, McConnell has expressed no interest in staging yet another vote that produces an embarrassing rejection by the GOP-controlled Senate. Conservatives are wary because the bill falls short in erasing Obama\'s wide-ranging coverage requirements.\n"I don\'t think this bill will go anywhere," said Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky.\nA third effort, a bipartisan attempt to shore up individual insurance markets around the country, is showing early signs that the sides are having problems reaching agreement.\nSens. Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn., and Patty Murray, D-Wash., hope to reach a deal on continuing for at least a year the federal payments to insurers that Trump has threatened to halt. Republicans are also insisting on easing the Obama law\'s coverage requirements, which Democrats don\'t want to do.\nAlexander said Tuesday that Republicans want "real state flexibility" to let insurers offer "a larger variety of benefits and payment rules."\nMurray said she worried the GOP wants to "wind up increasing out-of-pocket costs for patients and families." That\'s something Democrats oppose.\nMcConnell said the Alexander-Murray talks "are underway and we\'ll see where they go."\n'

aS' Former business associates of Michael Flynn have told lawmakers that he traveled to the Middle East in 2015 as part of a private proposal to build nuclear power plants across the region, a trip that the former Trump administration national security adviser never disclosed during his security clearance process.\nIn a letter released Wednesday, two top House Democrats reveal that companies involved in the proposal provided details of Flynn\'s trip in June 2015 that suggest he also failed to report contacts with Israeli and Egyptian government officials. The lawmakers \xe2\x80\x94 Rep. Elijah Cummings of Maryland and Rep. Eliot Engel of New York \xe2\x80\x94 are now asking the companies and Flynn to provide the names and nationalities of any officials he met with during the trip abroad.\nThe information released by the lawmakers is the latest evidence that Flynn didn\'t fully account for his foreign contacts and business entanglements even though he was liable for possible federal criminal penalties for lying or omitting such information. Security clearance questionnaires specifically ask applicants to report any meetings abroad or contacts with foreign government officials that occurred in the previous seven years. As a former director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, Flynn maintained a security clearance. His last renewal was in early 2016.\nFlynn has been dogged by questions about his lack of disclosure of a Turkish lobbying operation and of foreign payments he accepted after leaving the military in 2014. Flynn also was forced to resign his Trump administration post in February after White House officials determined that he had misled them about the nature of diplomatic conversations with Russia\'s ambassador to the U.S.\nSpecial counsel Robert Mueller is scrutinizing Flynn\'s foreign interactions as part of his probe into Russia\'s meddling in the 2016 election and any possible coordination with Trump associates. Earlier this year, that investigation incorporated an ongoing federal probe into Flynn\'s lobbying for a Turkish businessman during the final months of the presidential campaign.\nFlynn\'s attorney, Robert Kelner, declined to comment on the letter. Flynn\'s legal team has previously said that he\'d like to cooperate with Congress but only intended to respond to subpoenas that compel him to do so. As members of the minority party, Cummings, the ranking member on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, and Engel, the ranking member of the House Foreign Affairs committee, do not have subpoena power.\nCummings and Engel first raised concerns in June about Flynn\'s 2015 Mideast trip after Newsweek reported that Flynn had worked with companies angling to persuade foreign governments and companies to join in a plan to build a cluster of 40 nuclear plants in the Mideast for civilian power needs. The lawmakers also seized on a comment Flynn made in congressional testimony in the summer of 2015, in which he said that he had just returned from the Middle East.\nIn their latest letter, Cummings and Engel write that "it appears that General Flynn violated federal law by omitting this trip and these foreign contacts from his security clearance renewal application in 2016 and concealing them from security clearance investigators who interviewed him as part of the background check process."\nBecause of the potential for a criminal violation, the two lawmakers say they are providing Mueller with the responses from the companies.\nAccording to the letter and documents released by Cummings and Engel, Flynn\'s Mideast trip was backed by ACU Strategic Partners, a U.S. firm that sent him to persuade officials to support a plan involving companies from the U.S., Russia, France, the Netherlands, Britain, Ukraine, Israel and several Persian Gulf nations.\nDr. Thomas Cochran, an adviser to ACU Strategic Partners, told the lawmakers that Flynn was expected to press Egyptian and other officials to hold off on accepting a rival offer from Russia to finance and construct a smaller system of four reactors in Egypt and two in Jordan.\nFlynn\'s Egypt visit "was to convince the government at least to postpone accepting the Russian offer to finance and build four reactors in order to carefully consider the ACU alternative," Cochran said in his response. Flynn also traveled to Israel where, Cochran said, he sought to assure Israel that the project would be in its interest.\nThe proposal has never gotten beyond the planning stage. But in his response, Cochran indicated that there could be support from the Trump administration, particularly in its effort to involve both U.S. and Russian interests. "The ACU project gives President Trump and Secretary (Rex) Tillerson a valuable private sector mechanism for helping stabilize and improve relations with Russia as well as helping accelerate U.S.-Russia cooperation in the Middle East," Cochran said.\nIn a separate response to the congressmen, ACU Managing Director Alex Copson confirmed that ACU paid Flynn\'s travel expenses and wrote him a $25,000 check for "loss of income and business opportunities resulting from this trip." But Copson told the lawmakers that banks records show Flynn never cashed the check.\nFlynn had previously not disclosed his compensation on his government financial disclosure filed earlier this year, but in August, he filed an amended disclosure that listed he had received more than $5,000 from ACU. Flynn also listed that he was a consultant to another company, IronBridge Group, which was connected to the project.\nAn attorney for retired Rear Adm. Michael Hewitt, the chairman of IronBridge, confirmed to lawmakers that Flynn took the trip, but did not provide details of his foreign contacts.\nThomas Egan, an attorney for ACU, said Tuesday that he had received the lawmakers\' letter, but the company had not yet decided whether it would respond. Michael Summersgill, an attorney for IronBridge, did not respond to a telephone message Tuesday seeking comment.\nSince the late 1990s, Copson has promoted a series of international nuclear-related projects that have not come to fruition. The House letter cites an April 2016 email forwarded from Copson to Hewitt and several others showing that Copson initially envisioned the U.S. and Russia as developing the reactor project. But turbulence in Syria and the Iran nuclear deal led Copson to propose bringing in other partners, including China.\n'

aS' With Myanmar drawing condemnation for violence that has driven at least 370,000 Rohingya to flee the country, the government said Wednesday its leader, Aung San Suu Kyi, will skip this month\'s U.N. General Assembly.\nSuu Kyi will miss the assembly, which opened Tuesday and runs through Sept. 25, in order to address domestic security issues, according to presidential office spokesman Zaw Htay.\nHer appearance at last year\'s General Assembly was a landmark: her first since her party won elections in 2015 and replaced a military-dominated government. Even then, however, she faced criticism over Myanmar\'s treatment of Rohingya, whose name she did not utter. Members of the ethnic group are commonly referred to as "Bengalis" by many in Myanmar who insist they migrated illegally from Bangladesh.\nSuu Kyi is not Myanmar\'s president \xe2\x80\x94 her official titles are state counselor and foreign minister \xe2\x80\x94 but she effectively serves as leader of the Southeast Asian nation.\nZaw Htay said that, with President Htin Kyaw hospitalized, second Vice President Henry Van Tio would attend the U.N. meeting.\n"The first reason (Suu Kyi cannot attend) is because of the Rakhine terrorist attacks," Zaw Htay said. "The state counselor is focusing to calm the situation in Rakhine state. There are circumstances. The second reason is, there are people inciting riots in some areas. We are trying to take care of the security issue in many other places. The third is that we are hearing that there will be terrorist attacks and we are trying to address this issue."\nThe crisis erupted on Aug. 25, when an insurgent Rohingya group attacked police outposts in Myanmar\'s Rakhine state. That prompted Myanmar\'s military to launch "clearance operations" against the rebels, setting off a wave of violence that have left hundreds dead and thousands of homes burned \xe2\x80\x94 mostly Rohingya in both cases.\nThe government blames Rohingya for the attacks, but journalists who visited the region found evidence that raises doubts about its claims that Rohingya set fire to their own homes.\nMany of the Rohingya who flooded into refugee camps in Bangladesh told of Myanmar soldiers shooting indiscriminately, burning their homes and warning them to leave or die. Others said they were attacked by Buddhist mobs.\nSuu Kyi, a Nobel Peace Prize laureate who lived under house arrest for many years under a military junta that ultimately gave way to an elected government, has faced a torrent of international criticism and pressure since the crisis erupted.\nOn Tuesday, Iran\'s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei called the killing of Muslims a political disaster and called Suu Kyi a "brutal woman." U.N. human rights chief Zeid Ra\'ad al-Hussein said the Rohingya were victims of what "seems a textbook example of ethnic cleansing."\nBangladesh has been overwhelmed with the massive influx of Rohingya, many of whom arrived hungry and traumatized after walking for days through jungles or being packed into rickety wooden boats.\nBefore Aug. 25, Bangladesh had already been housing some 500,000 Rohingya refugees who fled earlier flashes of violence including anti-Muslim riots in 2012.\nPrime Minister Sheikh Hasina has pledged to help the new arrivals, but demanded that Myanmar "take their nationals back."\nWith two pre-existing camps packed beyond capacity, the government said it would provide 2,000 acres (810 hectares) for a new camp in the border district of Cox\'s Bazar. Many of the new arrivals were staying in schools, or were huddling under tarps in makeshift settlements along roads and in open fields.\nBasic resources were scarce, including food, clean water and medical aid.\nDozens of foreign diplomats and aid agency officials were set to meet Rohingya refugees Wednesday near the Kutupalong refugee camp, according to Kazi Abdur Rahman, additional deputy commissioner in Cox\'s Bazar district.\n"A humanitarian crisis is going on here," he said. The diplomats "will visit camps, talk to them, see their condition. We need to work together during such a serious crisis."\nTwo human rights groups have accused the U.N. Security Council of ignoring the crisis.\n"This is an international peace and security crisis" and there is no excuse for the Security Council "sitting on its hands," Louis Charbonneau of Human Rights Watch said Tuesday alongside representatives from Amnesty International at the U.N. headquarters\nThe Organization of Islamic Cooperation, the world\'s largest Muslim body, urged Myanmar to allow in U.N. monitors so they can investigate what it alleged was systematic brutality against the Rohingya. The U.N. Human Rights Council approved an investigative mission earlier this year, but Myanmar in June refused to allow it to enter. An envoy\'s visit in July was met with protests.\nThe ethnic Rohingya Muslim minority has faced decades of discrimination persecution in Buddhist-majority Myanmar, where they are denied citizenship despite centuries-old roots in the country.\nOn Tuesday, the president\'s office said Myanmar\'s government had established a new committee to address security and economic development in Rohingya areas. It said the 15-member committee would work on implementing recommendations made last month by a commission led by former U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan.\n'

aS' A puzzling study of U.S. pregnancies found that women who had miscarriages between 2010 and 2012 were more likely to have had back-to-back annual flu shots that included protection against swine flu.\nVaccine experts think the results may reflect the older age and other miscarriage risks for the women, and not the flu shots. Health officials say there is no reason to change the government recommendation that all pregnant women be vaccinated against the flu. They say the flu itself is a much greater danger to women and their fetuses.\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has reached out to a doctor\'s group, the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, to warn them the study is coming out and help them prepare for a potential wave of worry from expectant moms, CDC officials said.\n"I want the CDC and researchers to continue to investigate this," said Dr. Laura Riley, a Boston-based obstetrician who leads a committee on maternal immunization. "But as an advocate for pregnant women, what I hope doesn\'t happen is that people panic and stop getting vaccinated."\nPast studies have found flu vaccines are safe during pregnancy, though there\'s been little research on impact of flu vaccinations given in the first three months of pregnancy.\nFlu and its complications kill thousands of Americans every year. The elderly, young children and pregnant women are especially at risk. When a new "swine flu" strain emerged in 2009, it killed 56 U.S. pregnant women that year, according to the CDC.\nThe study\'s authors, two of whom are CDC researchers, saw a big difference when they looked at women who had miscarried within 28 days of getting a shot that included protection against swine flu, but it was only when the women also had had a flu shot the previous season.\nThey found 17 of 485 miscarriages they studied involved women whose vaccinations followed that pattern. Just four of a comparable 485 healthy pregnancies involved women who were vaccinated that way.\nThe first group also had more women who were at higher risk for miscarriage, like older moms and smokers and those with diabetes. The researchers tried to make statistical adjustments to level out some of those differences but some researchers don\'t think they completely succeeded.\nOther experts said they don\'t believe a shot made from killed flu virus could trigger an immune system response severe enough to prompt a miscarriage. And the authors said they couldn\'t rule out the possibility that exposure to swine flu itself was a factor in some miscarriages.\nTwo other medical journals rejected the article before a third, Vaccine, accepted it. Dr. Gregory Poland, Vaccine\'s editor-in-chief, said it was a well-designed study that raised a question that shouldn\'t be ignored. But he doesn\'t believe flu shots caused the miscarriages. "Not at all," said Poland, who also is director of vaccine research at the Mayo Clinic.\nThough this study may cause worry and confusion, it is evidence "of just how rigorous and principled our vaccine safety monitoring system is," said Jason Schwartz, a Yale University vaccine policy expert.\nSome of the same researchers are working on a larger study looking at more recent data to see if a possible link between swine flu vaccine and miscarriage holds up, said James Donahue, a study author from the Wisconsin-based Marshfield Clinic Research Institute. The results aren\'t expected until next year at the earliest, he said.\n'

aS' Self-driving cars may not hit the road in earnest for many years - but autonomous boats could be just around the pier.\nSpurred in part by the car industry\'s race to build driverless vehicles, marine innovators are building automated ferry boats for Amsterdam canals, cargo ships that can steer themselves through Norwegian fjords and remote-controlled ships to carry containers across the Atlantic and Pacific. The first such autonomous ships could be in operation within three years.\nOne experimental workboat spent this summer dodging tall ships and tankers in Boston Harbor, outfitted with sensors and self-navigating software and emblazoned with the words "UNMANNED VESSEL" across its aluminum hull.\n"We\'re in full autonomy now," said Jeff Gawrys, a marine technician for Boston startup Sea Machines Robotics, sitting at the helm as the boat floated through a harbor channel.\n"Roger that," said computer scientist Mohamed Saad Ibn Seddik, as he helped to guide the ship from his laptop on a nearby dock.\nThe boat still needs human oversight. But some of the world\'s biggest maritime firms have committed to designing ships that won\'t need any captains or crews \xe2\x80\x94 at least not on board.\nDISTRACTED SEAFARING\nThe ocean is "a wide open space," said Sea Machines CEO Michael Johnson.\nBased out of an East Boston shipyard once used to build powerful wooden clippers, the cutting-edge sailing vessels of the 19th century, his company is hoping to spark a new era of commercial marine innovation that could surpass the development of self-driving cars and trucks.\nThe startup has signed a deal with an undisclosed company to install the "world\'s first autonomy system on a commercial containership," Johnson said this week. It will be remotely-controlled from land as it travels the North Atlantic. He also plans to sell the technology to companies doing oil spill cleanups and other difficult work on the water, aiming to assist maritime crews, not replace them.\nJohnson, a marine engineer whose previous job took him to the Italian coast to help salvage the sunken cruise ship Costa Concordia, said that deadly 2012 capsizing and other marine disasters have convinced him that "we\'re relying too much on old-world technology."\n"Humans get distracted, humans get tired," he said.\nGLOBAL RACE\nMilitaries have been working on unmanned vessels for decades. But a lot of commercial experimentation is happening in the centuries-old seaports of Scandinavia, where Rolls-Royce demonstrated a remote-controlled tugboat in Copenhagen this year. Government-sanctioned testing areas have been established in Norway\'s Trondheim Fjord and along Finland\'s western coast.\nIn Norway, fertilizer company Yara International is working with engineering firm Kongsberg Maritime on a project to replace big-rig trucks with an electric-powered ship connecting three nearby ports. The pilot ship is scheduled to launch next year, shift to remote control in 2019 and go fully autonomous by 2020.\n"It would remove a lot of trucks from the roads in these small communities," said Kongsberg CEO Geir Haoy.\nJapanese shipping firm Nippon Yusen K.K. \xe2\x80\x94 operator of the cargo ship that slammed into a U.S. Navy destroyer in a deadly June collision \xe2\x80\x94 plans to test its first remote-controlled vessel in 2019, part of a wider Japanese effort to deploy hundreds of autonomous container ships by 2025. A Chinese alliance has set a goal of launching its first self-navigating cargo ship in 2021.\nCARS VS. BOATS\nThe key principles of self-driving cars and boats are similar. Both scan their surroundings using a variety of sensors, feed the information into an artificial intelligence system and output driving instructions to the vehicle.\nBut boat navigation could be much easier than car navigation, said Carlo Ratti, an MIT professor working with Dutch universities to launch self-navigating vessels in Amsterdam next year. The city\'s canals, for instance, have no pedestrians or bikers cluttering the way, and are subject to strict speed limits.\nRatti\'s project is also looking at ways small vessels could coordinate with each other in "swarms." They could, for instance, start as a  fleet of passenger or delivery boats, then transform into an on-demand floating bridge to accommodate a surge of pedestrians.\nSince many boats already have electronic controls, "it would be easy to make them self-navigating by simply adding a small suite of sensors and AI," Ratti said.\nARMCHAIR CAPTAINS\nResearchers have already begun to design merchant ships that will be made more efficient because they don\'t need room for seamen to sleep and eat. But in the near future, most of these ships will be only partly autonomous.\nArmchair captains in a remote operation center could be monitoring several ships at a time, sitting in a room with 360-degree virtual reality views. When the vessels are on the open seas, they might not need humans to make decisions. It\'s just the latest step in what has been a gradual automation of maritime tasks.\n"If you go back 150 years, you had more than 200 people on a cargo vessel. Now you have between 10 and 20," said Oskar Levander, vice president of innovation for Rolls-Royce\'s marine business.\nCHANGING RULES OF THE SEA\nThere are still some major challenges ahead. Uncrewed vessels might be more vulnerable to piracy or even outright theft via remote hacking of a ship\'s control systems. Some autonomous vessels might win public trust faster than others; unmanned container ships filled with bananas might not raise the same concerns as oil tankers plying the waters near big cities or protected wilderness.\nA decades-old international maritime safety treaty also requires that "all ships shall be sufficiently and efficiently manned." But The International Maritime Organization, which regulates shipping, has begun a 2-year review of the safety, security and environmental implications of autonomous ships.\n'

aS'Women have led New York\xe2\x80\x99s City Council \xe2\x80\x94 two of them in a row as speaker \xe2\x80\x94 for almost 12 years. Some people may be tempted to say it means that female lawmakers in America\xe2\x80\x99s largest city finally have a solid grip on political power. It\xe2\x80\x99s a temptation to be resisted.\nThe reality is that women in New York City government struggle to be heard in numbers anywhere near their share of the population. They fare badly enough now, filling but \n \xe2\x80\x94 barely 25 percent. After Tuesday\xe2\x80\x99s Democratic primary races, there are bound to be fewer of them in the Council that convenes in January.\nGiven that Democratic primaries in the city are usually the main event and the November general election is an afterthought, there will probably be, at most, 12 councilwomen. And since the current speaker, Melissa Mark-Viverito, must leave office under the city\xe2\x80\x99s term-limits law, her leadership position may wind up in male hands.\nGlass ceilings are hardly exclusive to New York. In the four next largest American cities, women\xe2\x80\x99s hold on local councils comes, collectively, to just over that same 25 percent. In Los Angeles, they account for 2 of 15 councilors; in Chicago, 13 of 50; in Houston, 4 of 16; and in Philadelphia, 6 of 17. And they\xe2\x80\x99re no better off in \n.\nBut women in the New York City Council are sliding backward. A decade ago, they held 18 seats, the most ever. Term limits partly account for the subsequent decline. Those limits forced some women to leave, and men ended up being elected in their stead. The dwindled numbers impelled members of the \n to warn in a report last month that \xe2\x80\x9cwe face a systemic crisis of representation.\xe2\x80\x9d\nThat the very nature of a legislature can be shaped by gender balance is self-evident. This is true on a broad range of issues, but conspicuously so on matters like child care, maternity leave and preventive cancer screenings. At the federal level, how could heads not shake in May when Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader, formed his working group on health care? He initially thought it was fine to go with\n.\n\xe2\x80\x9cWomen legislators bring with them lived experiences and crucial viewpoints that allow them to identify and take on the unique challenges that women face,\xe2\x80\x9d the New York women\xe2\x80\x99s caucus aptly said.\nWomen\xe2\x80\x99s light presence in government is not a case of their faring worse than men at the ballot box. The CUNY Institute for State and Local Governance, a research group at the City University of New York, found that the sexes win or lose elections nationwide at about the same rates. The issue, the institute said in \n, is that women tend not to run for office in the first place.\nWhy is that? Some social scientists cite traditional family arrangements that limit women\xe2\x80\x99s career choices. Researchers at the \n have found what might be called an ambition gap, with women underestimating their abilities and chances for success. It makes them less likely than men to even consider seeking public office, or to have political professionals encourage them to run.\nThis week\xe2\x80\x99s voting in New York may have reflected that. Out of the 113 Democrats running in contested Council districts, only 38 were women. Of the 33 districts with Democratic primaries, 11 had not a single woman on the ballot. (In contrast, two districts had only female candidates; both seats are already held by women.)\nPolitical parties and advocacy groups, like the recently formed \n, need to do their utmost to recruit women if there\xe2\x80\x99s to be any chance of closing that ambition gap. Getting young women engaged politically, in college or even earlier, is especially important. The way things stand, women may hold up half the sky, as a saying goes, but politics is proving to be a heavier lift.\n'

aS' Eight patients at a sweltering nursing home died after Hurricane Irma knocked out the air conditioning, raising fears Wednesday about the safety of Florida\'s 4 million senior citizens amid power outages that could last for days.\nHollywood Police Chief Tom Sanchez said investigators believe the deaths at the Rehabilitation Center at Hollywood Hills were heat-related, and added: "The building has been sealed off and we are conducting a criminal investigation."\nGov. Rick Scott called on Florida emergency workers to immediately check on all nursing homes to make sure patients are safe, and he vowed to punish anyone found culpable in the deaths.\n"This situation is unfathomable," he said.\nThe home said in a statement that the hurricane had knocked out a transformer that powered the AC.\nThe five women and three men ranged in age from 70 to 99.\nExactly how the deaths happened was under investigation, with Sanchez saying authorities have not ruled anything out, including carbon monoxide poisoning from generators. He also said investigators will look into how many windows were open.\nAcross the street from the stifling nursing home sat a fully air-conditioned hospital, Memorial Regional.\nBroward County said the nursing home had alerted the county emergency operations center on Tuesday that it had lost power, but when asked if it had any medical needs or emergencies, it did not request help.\n"It\'s a sad state of affairs," the police chief said. "We all have elderly people in facilities, and we all know we depend on those people in those facilities to care for a vulnerable elderly population."\nThe deaths came as people trying to put their lives back together in hurricane-stricken Florida and beyond confronted a multitude of new hazards in the storm\'s aftermath, including tree-clearing accidents and lethal generator fumes.\nNot counting the nursing home deaths, at least 17 people in Florida have died under Irma-related circumstances, and six more in South Carolina and Georgia, many of them well after the storm had passed. The death toll across the Caribbean stood at 38.\nAt least six people died of apparent carbon monoxide poisoning from generators in Florida. A Tampa man died after the chain saw he was using to remove trees recoiled and cut his carotid artery.\nIn Hollywood, after responding to three early-morning calls about patients in distress, firefighters went through the facility and found three people dead and evacuated more than 150 patients to hospitals, many on stretchers or in wheelchairs, authorities said. By the afternoon, five more had died.\nPatients were treated for dehydration, breathing difficulties and other heat-related ills, authorities said.\nNursing homes in Florida are required by state and federal law to file an emergency plan that includes evacuation plans for residents. County officials released documents showing that the Hollywood facility was in compliance with that regulation and that it held a hurricane drill with its staff in October.\nCalls to the owner and other officials at the Hollywood home were not immediately returned, but the facility\'s administrator, Jorge Caballo, said in a statement that it was "cooperating fully with relevant authorities to investigate the circumstances that led to this unfortunate and tragic outcome."\nThrough a representative, Carballo told the SunSentinel newspaper that the home has a back-up generator but that it does not power the air conditioning.\nThe nursing home was bought at a bankruptcy auction two years ago after its previous owner went to prison for Medicare fraud, according to news reports at the time of the sale.\nThe Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which regulates nursing homes, gives the Hollywood center a below-average rating, two stars on its five-star scale. But the most recent state inspection reports showed no deficiencies in the area of emergency plans.\nBroward County Medical Examiner Dr. Craig Mallak said after receiving some of the bodies for autopsies that the victims had been in poor health, and "it\'s going to be tough to tell how much was the heat and how much of it was they were sick already."\nFlorida, long one of America\'s top retirement destinations, has the highest proportion of people 65 and older of any state \xe2\x80\x94 1 in 5 of its 20 million residents. As of 2016, Florida had about 680 nursing homes.\nThe number of people without electricity in the steamy late-summer heat was down to 6.8 million. Utility officials warned it could take over a week for power to be fully restored. The number of people in shelters fell to under 13,000.\nElsewhere around the state, a Coral Gables apartment building was evacuated after authorities determined a lack of power made it unsafe for elderly tenants.\nAnd at the huge, 15,000-resident Century Village retirement community in Pembroke Pines, more than half the residential buildings had no power Wednesday afternoon. Rescue crews went door to door in the 94-degree heat to check on people and hand out water, ice and meals.\n"These people are basically prisoners in their own homes," said Pembroke Pines City Manager Charlie Dodge. "That\'s why we are camped out there and doing whatever we can to assist them in this process. And we\'re not leaving."\nFlorida Sen. Bill Nelson called the six deaths in Hollywood "an inexcusable tragedy" and demanded a federal investigation.\n"We need to make sure we\'re doing everything we can to keep our seniors safe during this difficult time," he said.\nIn the battered Florida Keys, meanwhile, county officials pushed back against a preliminary estimate from the Federal Emergency Management Agency that 25 percent of all homes in the Keys were destroyed and nearly all the rest were heavily damaged.\n"Things look real damaged from the air, but when you clear the trees and all the debris, it\'s not much damage to the houses," said Monroe County Commissioner Heather Carruthers.\nThe Keys felt Irma\'s full fury when the hurricane roared in on Sunday with 130 mph (209 kph) winds. But the extent of the damage has been an unanswered question for days because some places have been unreachable.\nPresident Donald Trump plans to visit Naples, on Florida\'s hard-it southwestern coast, on Thursday.\nAt the Hollywood nursing home, Jean Lindor, a kitchen worker, said through a Haitian Creole translator that the air conditioner had not been working since the storm and it had been hot inside.\nPaulburn Bogle, a member of the housekeeping staff, said the place had been hot but manageable the past few days. The staff used fans, put cold towels and ice on patients and gave them cold drinks, he said.\nFlora Mitchell arrived at the home trying to learn the fate of her 58-year-old sister, a stroke patient. She said she last heard from her sister two days earlier and learned the air conditioning was not working.\n"We need to know what happened to her," she said. "They haven\'t told us anything."\n'

aS' Irma, which flattened some Caribbean islands and enveloped nearly all of Florida in its fury, no longer exists. The open Atlantic\'s most powerful hurricane on record finally sputtered out as an ordinary rainstorm over Ohio and Indiana.\nIrma\'s confirmed death toll is 61 and still rising, 38 in the Caribbean and 23 in the United States. In the U.S. alone, nearly 7 million people were told to evacuate, and 13 million Floridians were left without power in hot steamy weather.\nThis storm grew so immensely powerful over warmer-than-normal Atlantic water that it devastated the first islands in its path. Its gargantuan size \xe2\x80\x94 two Hurricane Andrews could fit inside it \xe2\x80\x94 spread so much fear that people all over the Florida peninsula upended their lives to flee.\n"This was a large, extremely dangerous catastrophic hurricane," National Hurricane Center spokesman and meteorologist Dennis Feltgen said Wednesday, when he said the storm was over.\nColorado State University hurricane researcher Phil Klotzbach put it simpler: "Irma was a beast."\nIrma generated as much accumulated energy in a dozen days as an entire six-month hurricane season would in an average year, Klotzbach calculated.\nJust 30 hours after it became a tropical storm on Aug. 30, Irma was a major Category 3 hurricane. By Sept. 4 it had intensified into a Category 4, with 130 mph winds, and it wasn\'t near done.\nIt became a Category 5 storm the next day with top winds of 185 mph, the highest ever recorded in the open Atlantic. Only one storm whirled faster \xe2\x80\x94 Hurricane Allen reached 190 mph in 1980 over the normally warm Gulf of Mexico \xe2\x80\x94 but Irma held its ferociously high speeds for 37 hours, a new global record for tropical cyclones. It beat Typhoon Haiyan, which also reached 185 mph before killing more than 6,000 people in the Philippines. Irma ultimately spent 78 hours as a Category 5, the longest in 85 years for Atlantic hurricanes.\nIrma\'s entire path, from its birth off Africa to its death over the Ohio Valley, stayed within the cone of the probable track forecast by the National Hurricane Center.\nIrma claimed its first victim when it was still far off, sending a "monster wave" to drown a teen-aged surfer in Barbados. Then it hit the Leeward Islands in full fury, sweeping a 2-year-old boy to his death after tearing the roof from his home.\nIrma bullied through much of the Caribbean \xe2\x80\x94 Antigua, St. Martin, St. Barts, Anguilla, the U.S. and British Virgin Islands, Turks and Caicos, the Bahamas. It narrowly skirted Puerto Rico, Haiti and the Dominican Republic. It turned lush tropical playgrounds into blasted-out landscapes, littered with splintered lumber, crumpled sheet metal and shattered lives. In St. Martin, 15 people were killed.\nIrma was still a Category 5 when it raked Cuba\'s coast, the first hurricane that size to hit the storm-prone island since 1924. At least 10 people died there, despite massive evacuations. And by moving briefly over land, it may have spared Florida a tougher punch.\nMore importantly, the system slowed, delaying its turn north and steering its center over Florida\'s west coast, which is less populated and less densely developed than the east. It also allowed dry air and high winds from the southwest to flow into Irma, taking a bite out of the storm and even tearing the southwest eyewall apart for a while.\nIrma was more vulnerable, but by no means weak. A Category 4 storm with 130 winds when it slammed into Cudjoe Key, it tied for history\'s seventh strongest hurricane to make U.S. landfall, based on its central pressure. With Harvey\'s swamping of Texas, this is the first year two Category 4 storms hit the United States.\nThe Keys were devastated. Federal officials estimated that a quarter of the homes were destroyed, and hardly any escaped damage. Roofs seemed peeled off by can-openers; power poles were nowhere to be seen.\nIrma was back over water as it closed in on mainland Florida, weakening still but spreading much wider \xe2\x80\x94 to more than 400 miles in girth \xe2\x80\x94 whipping the entire peninsula with winds of 39 mph or more. It pushed its highest storm surge, 10 feet, onto Florida\'s southwestern coast, while causing some of its worst flooding in northeast Florida, Georgia and South Carolina, far from Irma\'s center.\nIrma\'s second U.S. landfall was on Marco Island, near where Wilma hit in 2005. By then, Irma was a still-major Category 3, with 115 mph winds, but weakening fast. The worst of its fury somehow missed the Tampa Bay area, where homes were not nearly as flooded as those in faraway Jacksonville. Irma then sloshed through Georgia and Alabama as a tropical storm, blowing down tall trees and power lines, before dissipating Tuesday over Tennessee and Ohio.\n'

aS' A student who opened fire in a hallway at a Washington state high school killed a classmate who confronted him Wednesday and wounded three others before being stopped by a staff member, authorities said.\nThe suspect, who a classmate described as being obsessed with previous school shootings, was taken into custody. The wounded victims were expected to survive, officials said.\nThe shooter brought two weapons to Freeman High School in Rockford, south of Spokane, but the first one he tried to fire jammed, Spokane County Sheriff Ozzie Knezovich told reporters.\n"He went to his next weapon," Kzenovich said. "A student walked up to him, engaged him, and that student was shot. That student did not survive."\nThe sheriff said the shooter fired more rounds down the hallway, striking the other students, before a school staffer could stop him. Kzenovich called it a courageous act that prevented further bloodshed.\nElisa Vigil, a 14-year-old freshman, told The Associated Press that she saw one male student shot in the head who janitors covered with a cloth and another female student wounded in the back.\nMichael Harper, a 15-year-old sophomore, said the suspect had brought notes in the beginning of the school year, saying he was going to do "something stupid" and might get killed or jailed. Some students alerted counselors, the teen told AP, but it wasn\'t clear what school officials did in response.\nA call to the school was not immediately returned.\nHarper said the shooter had many friends and was not bullied, calling him "nice and funny and weird" and a huge fan of the TV show "Breaking Bad." He also said the suspect was obsessed with other school shootings.\nStudents say the shooter was armed with a pistol and rifle and had carried a duffel bag to school. After shots were fired, students went running and screaming down the hallways, Harper said.\nAuthorities didn\'t release the suspect\'s identity or a possible motive. The victims also were not named.\nLuis Prito, an assistant football coach at Freeman High, called the shooting devastating.\n"This is a real close-knit community," he said.\nA two-lane road into the town of about 500 people near the Idaho border was clogged as worried parents sped to the school. Some people abandoned their cars on the street to make it to their children.\nCheryl Moser said her son, a freshman, called her from a classroom after hearing shots fired.\n"He called me and said, \'Mom, there are gunshots.\' He sounded so scared. I\'ve never heard him like that," Moser told The Spokesman-Review newspaper. "You never think about something happening like this at a small school."\nProvidence Sacred Heart Medical Center and Children\'s Hospital received three pediatric patients, spokeswoman Nicole Stewart said. They were in stable condition and surrounded by family, she said.\nStephanie Lutje told AP she was relieved to hear her son was safe after his high school near Freeman High was put on lockdown. She commended the school district for its communication.\n"It\'s been amazing, within probably 15-20 minutes of hearing about it, I\'d already received a phone call, I\'d already received a text message saying that their school is OK," she said.\nShe still worried for others she knew, including a co-worker who had yet to hear from her son, a sophomore at Freeman.\n"My stomach\'s in knots right now," she said.\nGov. Jay Inslee said in a statement that "all Washingtonians are thinking of the victims and their families, and are grateful for the service of school staff and first responders working to keep our students safe."\n'

aS' White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Wednesday that sports anchor Jemele Hill could justifiably be fired from ESPN for tweets calling President Donald Trump a "white supremacist" and "a bigot."\n"I think that\'s one of the more outrageous comments that anyone could make, and certainly something that I think is a fire-able offense by ESPN," Sanders said.\nSanders said she was not sure whether the president was aware of Hill\'s comments.\nOn Monday night, in a series of exchanges with other Twitter users, Hill said, "Donald Trump is a white supremacist who has largely surrounded himself w/ other white supremacists."\nHill, an African-American co-host of the 6 p.m. broadcast of "SportsCenter," also added that "Trump is the most ignorant, offensive president of my lifetime. His rise is a direct result of white supremacy. Period."\nIn another tweet, she said, "Donald Trump is a bigot," and went on to criticize his supporters, adding "The height of white privilege is being able to ignore his white supremacy, because it\'s of no threat to you. Well, it\'s a threat to me."\nESPN distanced itself from Hill\'s tweets on Tuesday.\n"The comments on Twitter from Jemele Hill regarding the president do not represent the position of ESPN," the network tweeted from its public relations department\'s account. "We have addressed this with Jemele and she recognizes her actions were inappropriate."\nDisney-owned ESPN did not elaborate on any possible punishment for Hill, and she was on "SportsCenter" as usual on Tuesday and Wednesday.\nWhile many Twitter users called for Hill to be fired, unemployed NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick expressed his support, tweeting "We are with you @jemelehill."\nKaepernick, who remains unsigned after opting out of his contract with the San Francisco 49ers, received plenty of criticism \xe2\x80\x94 and support \xe2\x80\x94 after kneeling during the national anthem before games last season to protest police brutality.\nWhen asked why prominent African-Americans were criticizing Trump, Sanders said she could not speak for Hill and said the president has met with respected African-American leaders like U.S. Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina, the only black Republican in the Senate.\n"He\'s committed to working with them to bring the country together," Sanders said. "I think that\'s where we need to be focused \xe2\x80\x94 not on outrageous statements like that one."\nThe National Association of Black Journalists said in a statement that it "supports Hill\'s First Amendment rights on all matters of discussion, within and outside the world of sports, as they do not impinge on her duties as a host and commentator."\nThree weeks ago, ESPN said it pulled broadcaster Robert Lee, who is Asian-American, from the Virginia football season opener because of violence in Charlottesville, Virginia. The violence erupted at a rally to protest the decision to remove a statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee.\n'

aS' The U.S. on Wednesday banned federal agencies from using computer software supplied by Kaspersky Lab because of concerns about the company\'s ties to the Kremlin and Russian spy operations.\nThe directive issued by acting Homeland Security Secretary Elaine Duke comes as various U.S. law enforcement and intelligence agencies and several congressional committees are investigating Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election.\nKaspersky said in a statement that it was disappointed by the directive and insisted "it does not have unethical ties or affiliations with any government, including Russia."\nDuke directed all U.S. federal agencies and departments to stop using products or services supplied directly or indirectly by the Russian-owned and operated company. The directive gives agencies 30 days to determine whether they are using any Kaspersky products. The software must be removed from all information systems within 90 days.\n"The department is concerned about the ties between certain Kaspersky officials and Russian intelligence and other government agencies," the directive said. It said the department also is concerned about Russian laws that would permit Russian spy agencies to compel Kaspersky to provide assistance or intercept communications transiting Russian networks.\n"The risk that the Russian government \xe2\x80\x94 whether acting on its own or in collaboration with Kaspersky \xe2\x80\x94 could capitalize on access provided by Kaspersky products (in order) to compromise federal information and information systems directly implicates U.S. national security," the directive said.\nThe directive provides Kaspersky an opportunity to respond or mitigate the department\'s concerns.\nKaspersky said the company was happy to have an opportunity to provide information to show that the allegations are unfounded.\n"No credible evidence has been presented publicly by anyone or any organization as the accusations are based on false allegations and inaccurate assumptions, including claims about the impact of Russian regulations and policies on the company," Kaspersky said.\nKaspersky said it is not subject to the Russian laws cited in the directive and said information received by the company is protected in accordance with legal requirements and stringent industry standards, including encryption.\n"Kaspersky Lab has never helped, nor will help, any government in the world with its cyberespionage or offensive cyber efforts, and it\'s disconcerting that a private company can be considered guilty until proven innocent, due to geopolitical issues," Kaspersky said.\nThe chief executive of the company, Eugene Kaspersky, is a mathematical engineer who attended a KGB-sponsored school and once worked for Russia\'s Ministry of Defense. His critics say it\'s unlikely that his company could operate independently in Russia, where the economy is dominated by state-owned companies and the power of spy agencies has expanded dramatically under President Vladimir Putin.\nAt a Senate intelligence committee hearing in May, top U.S. officials were asked whether they would be comfortable with Kaspersky software on their computers.\n"No" was the reply given by then-acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe, CIA Director Mike Pompeo, National Intelligence Director Dan Coats, National Security Agency Director Adm. Mike Rogers, National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency Director Robert Cardillo and Defense Intelligence Agency Director Lt. Gen. Vincent Stewart.\nDemocrats on Capitol Hill applauded the decision.\nMinnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Rules Committee, sent a letter to Duke asking the department for information about the government\'s use of Kaspersky products, especially on critical infrastructure and election systems.\n"While our intelligence agencies may not use Kaspersky software, other federal agencies do," Klobuchar wrote. "Public contracting reports show that Kaspersky Lab software has been used by the Department of Justice, the Treasury Department, the Department of State and several other agencies.\n"Given that our intelligence officials would not use Kaspersky Lab software, it is alarming that essential U.S. government agencies do. This is especially concerning because the Russian government is actively trying to undermine our democracy."\nSen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., who has been voicing concern about Kaspersky for months, said the directive was a positive step. She called the company\'s ties with the Kremlin "alarming."\nShaheen has been working to pass a government-wide ban on Kaspersky software, which would effectively make the directive the law. In June, she successfully amended the defense policy bill to ban the Defense Department from using Kaspersky software. Since then, she\'s offered another amendment to the bill, which is being debated on the Senate floor, to extend the ban to the entire federal government.\nRep. Bennie Thompson, D-Miss., the ranking member of the House Homeland Security Committee, said that since the election, questions have intensified about federal information networks use of the Russian company\'s software.\n"To date, DHS had only issued four binding operational directives to federal agencies and they\'ve done so quietly," Thompson said. "It is clear that DHS\'s decision to issue this directive, in a very public way, is significant."\n'

aS' House Speaker Paul Ryan backed off months of promises that the Republicans\' tax plan won\'t add to the nation\'s ballooning deficit, declaring Wednesday in an AP Newsmaker interview that the most important goal of an overhaul is economic growth.\nAsked twice whether he would insist the emerging tax plan won\'t pile more billions onto the $20 trillion national debt, Ryan passed up the chance to affirm that commitment. GOP leaders made that "revenue neutral" promise in a campaign manifesto last year and many times since.\n"We want pro-growth tax reform that will get the economy going, that will get people back to work, that will give middle-income taxpayers a tax cut and that will put American businesses in a better competitive playing field so that we keep American businesses in America," the Wisconsin Republican told Associated Press reporters and editors. "That is more important than anything else."\nRyan\'s comments signaling possible retreat on a core GOP commitment came amid quickening action on taxes, which Republicans view as their last, best chance to notch a significant accomplishment to take to voters in the 2018 midterm elections following the collapse of their "Obamacare" repeal drive. Yet even as President Donald Trump hunted for Democratic votes for a plan that\'s not yet taken shape, and GOP leaders laid out an aggressive timetable to lawmakers, significant hurdles remained.\nA major one is the GOP\'s failure, thus far, to pass a federal budget, which under legislative rules is a prerequisite for a tax plan that can avoid being stalled to death by Democrats in the Senate.\nOthers involve the contents of the tax blueprint itself, which Ryan and his lieutenants envision as a far-reaching reform plan that would significantly lower rates for corporations and individuals while cleaning up the loophole-ridden code. One problem is that every tax deduction has its own constituency, and Ryan has already ruled out eliminating some of the most popular ones, including deductions for home mortgages and charitable giving.\nObjections also threaten from the GOP\'s seemingly shrinking ranks of deficit hawks if Ryan, Trump and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell do try to move forward with a tax plan that could cost hundreds of billions of dollars, without paying for it with cuts in federal spending or some new sources of revenue. Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tenn., chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, issued a statement earlier this week calling the debt the "greatest threat to our nation," greater than North Korea, Russia or the Islamic State group.\nRyan made his comments on taxes as he discussed a range of issues with the AP, including immigration, where he pledged to find a solution for the nearly 800,000 immigrants brought to this country as children and now here illegally. He declared that removing them all is "not in our nation\'s interest," though he declined to reaffirm his past support for eventual citizenship for the "Dreamers."\nHe said any immigration solution must include border security measures, though he said a wall along the entire southern border, which Trump has repeatedly urged, doesn\'t make sense.\nOn taxes, Trump himself added to the complications when he surprisingly declared, at a meeting with a bipartisan group of House members, that taxes on the wealthy would not go down under the GOP plan and might even go up. Although the administration has not provided specifics on its plan, House Republicans have embraced an approach that would lower the top individual rate from 39.6 percent to 33 percent, which would be enormously beneficial to the wealthiest Americans.\nStill, Trump declared, "The rich will not be gaining at all with this plan. We are looking for the middle class and we are looking for jobs \xe2\x80\x94 jobs being the economy."\nTrump reiterated that he hoped to lower the top corporate tax rate from 35 to 15 percent, something Ryan has already ruled out as impractical \xe2\x80\x94 and an idea the president himself has backed off from, according to people with knowledge of a meeting he held Tuesday night with bipartisan senators.\nThe president added, improbably, that the individual rate would be even lower than that.\nThe long list of difficulties has led some analysts to conclude that Congress is likelier to settle on straightforward tax cuts than on full-blown reform \xe2\x80\x94 if it passes anything at all.\nBut Ryan rejected that approach, telling the AP, "It\'s not just narrow cuts in taxes that will do the job."\nReferencing tax cuts signed by President George W. Bush, Ryan said, "You can\'t just do what Bush did in 2001 and 2003. You have to overhaul the system itself to put American businesses and the American economy in a much more competitive situation."\nEarlier Wednesday, Ryan and House Ways and Means Chairman Kevin Brady met behind closed doors with GOP lawmakers to lay out a timetable on taxes, pledging a detailed blueprint from top congressional Republicans and administration officials in the final week of September. The goal, which Ryan reiterated Wednesday, is to send Trump a bill to sign before year\'s end.\nThe challenges were immediately apparent as House Republicans left the meeting with Ryan and Brady complaining they still didn\'t know what was going on. And some conservatives were voicing concerns about Trump\'s newfound fondness for making deals with Democrats, as he did last week on the debt ceiling with House Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi of California.\nSchumer and Pelosi were invited to the White House for dinner Wednesday night, with no Republicans present save the president, who was once a Democrat.\n"The problem here is we don\'t have a clue what\'s in the tax plan," said Rep. Dave Brat, R-Va. "Now Trump is talking about doing bipartisan stuff with Chuck and Nancy on taxes. And I don\'t want to open the door to that until we see what this tax plan looks like."\n'

aS' A man convicted of killing two people in back-to-back robberies in suburban Cleveland in 1992 was executed Wednesday as family members of his victims looked on.\nThe prison system announced the time of death for Gary Otte as 10:54 a.m. following the administration of three lethal drugs at the Southern Ohio Correctional Facility in Lucasville.\nIn his final statement, the 45-year-old Otte professed his love for his family, sang a Christian hymn and quoted the Bible. He said, "God is good all the time," and added, "I\'m sorry." Then, he sighed deeply and began singing, "The Greatest Thing," with words such as "I want to know you, Lord" and "I want to serve you, Lord." He stopped singing at 10:39.\nOtte quoted the Bible with his last words: "Father, forgive them, for they know not what they\'re doing. Amen." The words were derived from a Bible account of Jesus Christ\'s crucifixion.\nOtte gave a thumbs-up sign, and then his stomach rose and fell several times between 10:41 and 10:42. Two members of the state execution team did a consciousness check at 10:42. Otte\'s stomach continued to rise and fall a couple of more minutes, then he appeared to go still.\nDefense attorney Carol Wright said she believes the rising and falling of Otte\'s chest and tears she saw on his face while the first drug, the sedative midazolam, was being administered indicated that he was suffering from a phenomenon known as air hunger. Those occurrences "indicated to me that he was feeling pain or sensations," said Wright, who tried unsuccessfully at first to leave the room to alert a federal judge about her concerns.\nProper security protocol was followed, and the execution was carried out without complication, prisons spokeswoman JoEllen Smith said.\n"Once (Wright\'s) identity and intention was verified, she was given permission to exit the room," Smith said.\nOtte had unsuccessfully argued Ohio\'s lethal-injection method put him at risk of suffering serious pain because the midazolam might not render him deeply unconscious. The rising and falling of his chest was similar to reactions in past executions when a different drug was used.\nOtte was sentenced to die for the Feb. 12, 1992, killing of Robert Wasikowski and the Feb. 13, 1992, killing of Sharon Kostura.\nWitnesses on Wednesday included the daughter and brother of Wasikowski and the sister, brother-in-law and niece of Kostura.\nOtte didn\'t sleep after arriving at the prison at 9:46 a.m. Tuesday and spent his time on the phone with friends and family and visiting with his parents and other relatives.\nHis legal appeals ended about two hours before his scheduled execution when the Ohio Supreme Court declined to weigh in on his contention that he shouldn\'t be put to death because of his age at the time of the crime.\nOtte was 20 when he killed Wasikowski and Kostura.\nAuthorities had said he asked to go inside Wasikowski\'s apartment to use the phone and then shot the 61-year-old and stole about $400. The next day, authorities say, Otte forced his way into the apartment of the 45-year-old Kostura in the same building, shot her and stole $45 and her car keys.\nBoth the state Parole Board and Republican Gov. John Kasich denied Otte\'s request for clemency.\nOtte\'s drug addiction, intoxication and depression led to the slayings, and Otte had poor legal assistance at trial, his public defenders said in documents filed with the parole board. They argued that a life sentence without parole was an appropriate alternative.\nThe Cuyahoga County prosecutor said Otte still wouldn\'t take full responsibility for his crimes and tried to blame others, including the victims.\nThe killings weren\'t spur-of-the-moment decisions by Otte, who lingered in the victims\' apartments to rob them and even turned the TV up to block out Kostura\'s pleas for help, county prosecutor Michael O\'Malley said in a January filing with the parole board.\n'

aS' For more than 100 years, American League teams have gone on winning streaks of varying lengths \xe2\x80\x94 short ones, long ones, double-digit ones.\nNothing, though, like the one the Cleveland Indians have pieced together.\nA streak for the ages.\nMoving past the "Moneyball" Oakland Athletics, the Indians set the AL record with their 21st straight win on Wednesday, 5-3 over the Detroit Tigers, to join only two other teams in the past 101 years to win that many consecutive games.\nJay Bruce hit a three-run homer off Buck Farmer (4-3) and Mike Clevinger (10-5) won his fourth straight start as the Indians, a team with its sights set on ending the majors\' longest World Series title drought, matched the 1935 Chicago Cubs for the second-longest streak since 1900.\nAnd in doing so, they separated themselves from every AL team since the league was formed in 1901.\n"Who would\'ve ever thought that we\'d be in this situation?" Bruce said. "I can\'t even imagine."\nBelieve it.\nNow that they\'ve moved past those 2002 A\'s immortalized on film, the Indians are within five wins of catching the 1916 New York Giants, who won 26 straight without a loss but whose century-old mark includes a tie.\nThe Indians haven\'t lost in 20 days, and they\'ve rarely been challenged during a late-season run in which they\'ve dominated every aspect of the game.\n"I think they\'re enjoying themselves," manager Terry Francona said as clubhouse music boomed in the background. "They should. I think what\'s kind of cool about our game is when you do things, and you do them the right way, I think it means more. Our guys are playing the game to win, the right way.\n"That part\'s very meaningful. They should enjoy what they\'re doing. It\'s pretty special."\nAfter leading 4-1, the Indians had to overcome a costly error and rely on their bullpen to hold off the Tigers, who have lost 11 of 12 to Cleveland and saw manager Brad Ausmus and catcher James McCann ejected from the series finale.\nRoberto Perez added a homer in the seventh and four Cleveland relievers finished, with Cody Allen working the ninth for his 27th save.\nWith the crowd of 29,346 standing and stomping, Allen retired Ian Kinsler on a sinking liner for the final out, giving the Indians the league\'s longest streak since the AL was founded 116 years ago.\nThere was no big celebration afterward as the Indians simply congratulated one another and stuck to their routine.\n"We\'re so focused," said Bruce, who arrived via trade last month from the New York Mets. "I thought we were playing the Royals today. ... Everyone comes here and gets ready to play today and I think that\'s something that speaks volumes."\nDuring their streak, which began with a 13-6 win over Boston ace Chris Sale on Aug. 23, the Indians have rarely been tied, never mind equaled, for nine innings. They have been superior in every way possible.\nCleveland\'s starters have gone 19-0 with a 1.70 ERA, they\'ve outscored their opponents 139-35 and trailed in only four of 189 innings.\nIncredibly, the Indians have hit more home runs (40) than their pitchers have given up in total runs.\nAnd while they\'ve racked up win after win, the defending AL champs have reduced their magic number for winning their second straight AL Central title to four. They\'ve also passed Houston for the league\'s best record, which will come into play in the postseason as the team with the best overall mark will have home-field advantage.\nNow that they\'re alongside the 1935 Cubs, the Indians have a realistic shot of running down the 1916 Giants.\nCleveland opens four-game series on Thursday against Kansas City, which was outscored 20-0 on its three-day visit last month.\nFrancona was asked if he thought the Giants\' run should be the record since it includes a tie.\n"I wasn\'t there," he said, drawing laughter. "I\'ve given that zero thought. I promise you I\'ve given it no thought."\nWith a shot at AL history, Clevinger took the mound with Jimi Hendrix\'s "Purple Haze" blasting through the ballpark\'s sound system, and Cleveland\'s crowd came to rock \xe2\x80\x94 and witness history \xe2\x80\x94 on a mostly sunny day.\nSome parents kept their kids home from school and brought them to Progressive Field to see a once-in-a-lifetime event Cleveland residents may remember more than any solar eclipse. They cheered every two-strike count like it was October and there was something much bigger on the line. The Indians have viewed the streak as a perfect postseason warmup as they try to end a Series title drought dating to 1948.\nClevinger, who didn\'t allow a run in 18 innings over his three previous starts, was down 1-0 in the first after Jeimer Candelario touched him for a two-out RBI double.\nBut as they have done for the past three weeks, the Indians responded, with Bruce connecting for a three-run shot into the left-field bleachers.\n"Expected, I would say by now," Clevinger said of the Indians\' 3-run answer. "I don\'t think there was a second that I doubted we were going to score some runs or string together some hits."\nSIZZLING SEPTEMBER\nAt 14-0, the Indians are off to the best start in September since the 1991 Minnesota Twins went 15-0.\nTESTY TIGERS\nTwo batters after Ausms and McCann were ejected, a pitch from Farmer eluded catcher John Hicks, who had just entered the game, and struck plate umpire Quinn Wolcott in the chest.\nFarmer disputed that the Tigers would try to intentionally hit Wolcott.\n"The fact that\'s even a question is appalling," Farmer said. "It shouldn\'t be a question. When you look at the situation it\'s stupid to even think about. It shouldn\'t even be a thought from anybody that Hicks and I would do that."\nTRAINER\'S ROOM\nTigers: OF Mikie Mahtook missed his fifth consecutive game after being scratched from a Sept. 9 game against Toronto with left groin soreness. Ausmus said Mahtook was "getting closer, but he\'s not ready."\nIndians: All-Star reliever Andrew Miller will be activated from the disabled list Thursday following his second stint on the disabled list with knee tendinitis.\nUP NEXT\nThe Indians\' Josh Tomlin, who is 5-0 with a 2.57 ERA in his last six outings, starts the opener against Royals rookie Jakob Junis.\n'

aS' The Trump administration on Wednesday told U.S. government agencies to remove Kaspersky Lab products from their networks, saying it was concerned the Moscow-based cyber security firm was vulnerable to Kremlin influence and that using its anti-virus software could jeopardize national security. \nThe decision represents a sharp response to what U.S. intelligence agencies have described as a national security threat posed by Russia in cyberspace, following an election year marred by allegations that Moscow weaponized the internet in an attempt to influence its outcome. \nIn a statement, Kaspersky Lab rejected the allegations, as it has done repeatedly in recent months, and said its critics were misinterpreting Russian data-sharing laws that only applied to communications services. \n\xe2\x80\x9cNo credible evidence has been presented publicly by anyone or any organization as the accusations are based on false allegations and inaccurate assumptions,\xe2\x80\x9d the company said. \nThe Department of Homeland Security (DHS) issued a directive to federal agencies ordering them to identify Kaspersky products on their information systems within 30 days and begin to discontinue their use within 90 days.  \nThe order applies only to civilian government agencies and not the Pentagon, but U.S. intelligence leaders said earlier this year that Kaspersky was already generally not allowed on military networks. \nIn a statement accompanying its directive, DHS said it was \xe2\x80\x9cconcerned about the ties between certain Kaspersky officials and Russian intelligence and other government agencies, and requirements under Russian law that allow Russian intelligence agencies to request or compel assistance from Kaspersky and to intercept communications transiting Russian networks.\xe2\x80\x9d \nIt continued: \xe2\x80\x9cThe risk that the Russian government, whether acting on its own or in collaboration with Kaspersky, could capitalize on access provided by Kaspersky products to compromise federal information and information systems directly implicates U.S. national security.\xe2\x80\x9d \nThe department said it would provide Kaspersky with the opportunity to submit a written response to address the allegations. The agency said other entities claiming commercial interests affected by the directive could also submit information   \nKaspersky Lab has repeatedly denied that it has ties to any government and said it would not help a government with cyber espionage.  \nHowever, the company has not been able to shake off the allegations. Last week, Best Buy Co (\n), the No.1 U.S. electronics retailer, said it was pulling Kaspersky Lab\xe2\x80\x99s cyber security products from its shelves and website. \n\xe2\x80\x98TOUGH DECISION\xe2\x80\x99 \nRob Joyce, the White House cyber security coordinator, said Wednesday at the Billington CyberSecurity Summit that the Trump administration made a \xe2\x80\x9crisk-based decision\xe2\x80\x9d to order Kaspersky Lab\xe2\x80\x99s products removed from federal agencies. \nAsked by Reuters whether there was a smoking gun showing Kaspersky Lab had provided intelligence to the Russian government, Joyce replied: \xe2\x80\x9dAs we evaluated the technology, we decided it was a risk we couldn\xe2\x80\x99t accept.\xe2\x80\x9d \nSome cyber security experts have warned that blacklisting Kaspersky Lab could prompt a retaliation from Russian President Vladimir Putin. Joyce said those concerns were a factor but that a \xe2\x80\x9ctough decision\xe2\x80\x9d ultimately had to be made to protect government systems. \nThe direct financial impact of the decision will likely be minimal for Kaspersky Lab, one of the world\xe2\x80\x99s leading anti-virus software companies, which was founded in 1997 and now counts over 400 million global customers. \nFederal contracting databases reviewed by Reuters show only a few hundred thousand dollars in purchases from Kaspersky, and an employee told Reuters in July the company\xe2\x80\x99s federal government revenue was \xe2\x80\x9cminiscule.\xe2\x80\x9d \nBut Kaspersky also sells to federal contractors and third-party software companies that incorporate its technology in their products, so its technology may be more widely used in government than it appears from the contracting databases, U.S. officials say. \nThe decision by the Trump administration came as the U.S. Senate was planning to vote as soon as this week on a defense policy spending bill that includes language that would ban Kaspersky Lab products from being used by U.S. government agencies. \nDemocratic U.S. Senator Jeanne Shaheen, who had led efforts in Congress to crack down on Kaspersky Lab, applauded the Trump administration\xe2\x80\x99s announcement. \n\xe2\x80\x9cThe strong ties between Kaspersky Lab and the Kremlin are alarming and well-documented,\xe2\x80\x9d Shaheen said, adding that she expected Congress to act soon to reinforce the decision by passing legislation. \nAlso on Wednesday, Democratic Senator Amy Klobuchar wrote to DHS asking whether the agency used Kaspersky products in relation to any critical infrastructure, such as election equipment, banks or energy suppliers, and if it knew whether any voting systems used the company\xe2\x80\x99s software. \nEugene Kaspersky, the company\xe2\x80\x99s co-founder and chief executive, attended a KGB school, and the company has acknowledged doing work for the Russian intelligence agency known as the FSB. But he has adamantly denied charges his company conducts espionage on behalf of the Russian government. \n'

aS' A student carrying two guns opened fire at his high school near Spokane, Washington on Wednesday, killing one classmate and injuring three others before he was apprehended by a staff member, the local sheriff said. \nThe slain student was trying to convince the shooter, whose first gun had jammed, not to carry out the morning rampage when he was shot dead, Spokane County Sheriff Ozzie Knezovich told reporters. \nThe gunman then fired on three other students in a second-floor hallway of Freeman High School in Rockford, Washington, Knezovich said. The surviving victims, who were in their mid-teens, were listed in stable condition, a local hospital said. \nKnezovich declined to identify the suspect or discuss what may have motivated the gun violence in detail but said: \xe2\x80\x9cIt sounds like a case of a bullying-type of situation.\xe2\x80\x9d \nHe said that a member of the staff at Freeman who he described as \xe2\x80\x9cvery courageous\xe2\x80\x9d was able to capture the gunman before police officers arrived on scene to take him into custody. He was being held at Spokane County juvenile jail. \n\xe2\x80\x9cFortunately that one (gun) jammed. This would have been a lot worse if it didn\xe2\x80\x98t,\xe2\x80\x9d Knezovich said. \xe2\x80\x9cThese are senseless, tragic events that really don\xe2\x80\x99t need to happen and I don\xe2\x80\x99t really understand them.\xe2\x80\x9d  \n\xe2\x80\x9cBut we need to figure out what\xe2\x80\x99s gone wrong with our society that our children decide that they need to take weapons to deal with the issues that they\xe2\x80\x99re facing,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \nA freshman who witnessed the shooting told local KREM-TV that the shooter, a classmate since elementary school, stalked the hallway with a pistol and second gun, appearing calm as he fired at his victims and the ceiling. \nThe girl said that the suspect was an \xe2\x80\x9coutgoing\xe2\x80\x9d boy who she would not have thought capable of such violence. But she said other students had told her that he had made an ominous post about his intentions on a social media account. \nFollowing the shooting at the school of 327 students, some parents abandoned their cars stuck in traffic and walked up to a mile to reach their children, KHQ-TV reported. \n\xe2\x80\x9cThis morning\xe2\x80\x99s shooting at Freeman High School is heartbreaking. All Washingtonians are thinking of the victims and their families,\xe2\x80\x9d Governor Jay Inslee said on Twitter. \nThe United States has had an average of 52 school shooting incidents a year since a gunman killed 26 young children and educators in Newtown, Connecticut, in 2012, according to Everytown for Gun Safety, a gun-control group founded in response to that massacre. \n'

aS' U.S. senators unveiled two opposing visions of a healthcare  system in the United States on Wednesday - leading liberals advocating government insurance for all and several Republicans proposing an eleventh-hour repeal of Obamacare to replace it with programs run by the states. \nNeither plan was thought likely to succeed in a Congress exhausted with fighting over the issue, raising questions over whether lawmakers would instead prop up the health benefits offered under former President Barack Obama\xe2\x80\x99s healthcare law. \nIndependent Senator Bernie Sanders, a 2016 Democratic Party presidential candidate, held a campaign-style gathering at which enthusiasts applauded as he proposed extending the federal Medicare health insurance program for seniors to include everyone. \n\xe2\x80\x9cThe American people want to know what we are going to do to fix a dysfunctional healthcare system which costs us twice as much per person as any other country and yet leaves 28 million people uninsured, and even more underinsured,\xe2\x80\x9d Sanders declared. \nSenator Elizabeth Warren, one of 16 Democratic co-sponsors for Sanders\xe2\x80\x99 proposal, told the gathering it was time to go a step beyond Obamacare, the 2010 law officially called the Affordable Care Act that expanded health coverage to 20 million Americans.  \n\xe2\x80\x9cWe will say that in this country everyone gets a basic right to healthcare,\xe2\x80\x9d Warren said. \nBut in an office building nearby, Republican senators announced they were offering a \xe2\x80\x9clast chance\xe2\x80\x9d to repeal Obamacare, before a parliamentary procedure allowing them to pass it with a simple majority, instead of a three-fifths majority like most Senate legislation, expires at the end of September. \nThey proposed replacing the law with a program that would give states money in the form of block grants to run their own healthcare programs. \nSenator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, one of the plan\xe2\x80\x99s authors, said he was not ready to give up the long-held Republican goal of repealing Obamacare despite a stunning failure to muster enough votes within the party this summer to kill the law. \n\xe2\x80\x9cThe idea that the Republican party has done its best to repeal and replace Obamacare is a joke,\xe2\x80\x9d said Graham, who was joined by fellow Republican Bill Cassidy in the effort. \nA system of U.S. government-run healthcare for all is anathema to many Republicans, who think the hybrid Obamacare system in which government subsidizes private health insurance already was a step too far. \nRepublicans\xe2\x80\x99 last attempt in July to overturn Obamacare fell one vote short in the Senate in a humiliating defeat for President Donald Trump and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. \nIn addition to the Sanders and Graham-Cassidy proposals, a bipartisan effort is under way in the Senate health committee to repair Obamacare without repealing it, by protecting subsidies that are paid to insurance companies to help offset discounts under the program. \nMcConnell this week declined to comment on either the Cassidy-Graham bill or the bipartisan health committee effort, saying the way forward was not clear. The Republican leader is not expected to bring Sanders\xe2\x80\x99 proposal to the Senate floor for a vote.  \nTrump applauded Graham and Cassidy, saying he hoped the senators \xe2\x80\x9chave found a way to address the Obamacare crisis.\xe2\x80\x9d \nTrump has frequently complained that Obamacare is in crisis. Democrats dispute this but many admit there is room for improvement. A greater than expected mixture of sick and healthy customers hampered Obamacare from the start, leading to large premium increases and many counties have just one insurer.    \n'

aS' The Trump administration has engaged in an unconstitutional practice of searching without a warrant the phones and laptops of Americans who are stopped at the border, a lawsuit filed on Wednesday alleged. \nTen U.S. citizens and one lawful permanent resident sued the Department of Homeland Security in federal court, saying the searches and prolonged confiscation of their electronic devices violate privacy and free speech protections of the U.S. Constitution. \nDHS could not be immediately reached for comment. \nThe lawsuit comes as the number of searches of electronic devices has surged in recent years, alarming civil rights advocates. \nU.S. Customs and Border Patrol reported in April that searches increased from 8,500 in fiscal year 2015 to about 19,000 in fiscal year 2016. The agency has conducted nearly 15,000 in the first half of fiscal year 2017. \nThe suit, filed in a U.S. District Court in Massachusetts, is being brought by travelers including a military veteran, a NASA engineer, two journalists and a computer programmer. The Electronic Frontier Foundation and the American Civil Liberties Union, who are representing the travelers, said that several of the plaintiffs are Muslim or minorities. \nSuhaib Allababidi, a U.S. citizen who lives in Texas and a plaintiff in the case, said in an interview that he was stopped by Customs and Border Patrol on Jan. 21 at the Dallas airport after returning from a business trip to Dubai.  \nAllababidi said he declined to unlock his personal phone for the officers after allowing them to search his separate business phone. \nThe officers confiscated both his phones, Allababidi said, and returned his business phone to him two months later. The government has still not returned his personal phone after more than seven months, he said. \n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are left in the dark with no answers,\xe2\x80\x9d Allababidi said. \xe2\x80\x9cWill I get my phone back, did I do anything wrong? ... They took my phone, and that\xe2\x80\x99s all I know.\xe2\x80\x9d \nGenerally, U.S. law enforcement is required to obtain a warrant before it can search an American\xe2\x80\x99s electronic devices.  \nBut a so-called border search exception allows federal authorities to conduct searches within 100 miles (160 km) of a U.S. border without a warrant. \nIn April, Democratic Senator Ron Wyden and Republican Senator Rand Paul introduced legislation that would require a warrant before federal agents search devices at the border that belong to a U.S. citizen or permanent resident, except in some emergency circumstances. \n'

aS' The U.S. State Department on Wednesday will stop issuing certain kinds of visas to some citizens of Cambodia, Eritrea, Guinea and Sierra Leone because the nations are not taking back their citizens the United States wants to deport. \nThe new policies, laid out in State Department cables reviewed by Reuters on Tuesday and described in a department news briefing, are the latest example of U.S. President Donald Trump\xe2\x80\x99s effort to crack down on immigrants who are in the United States illegally. \nThe cables, sent by Secretary of State Rex Tillerson to consular officials around the world, said the four countries were \xe2\x80\x9cdenying or unreasonably delaying\xe2\x80\x9d the return of their citizens, and that visa restrictions would be lifted in a country if it accepted its deportees. \n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Secretary determines the categories of applicants subject to the visa restrictions, and the categories differ slightly country by country,\xe2\x80\x9d State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in the news briefing on Tuesday.  \nThe visa sanctions vary in severity, with Eritrea facing the harshest ones. Any Eritreans who apply in their own country for most U.S. business or tourist visas will be rejected, according to one of the cables. (\n) \nIn Guinea, the United States will no longer issue a range of tourist, business and student visas to government officials and their immediate family members who apply from inside the country, another cable said. (\n) \n\xe2\x80\x9cWe are all surprised by the American authorities\xe2\x80\x99 decision but the foreign minister is at this moment working so that the situation returns to normal,\xe2\x80\x9d Guinea government spokesman Damantang Albert Camara told Reuters. \n\xe2\x80\x9cIt must be understood that Guinea has never wanted to prevent the repatriation of its nationals who are in conflict with American law.\xe2\x80\x9d  \nIn Cambodia, the sanction is tailored. Only Foreign Ministry employees at or above the rank of director general, and their families, who apply inside the country will be barred from getting some visas for personal travel, a third cable said. (\n) \nFor Sierra Leone, only Foreign Ministry and immigration officials will be denied tourist and business visas at the U.S. Embassy in Freetown, according to a fourth cable. (\n) \n\xe2\x80\x9cAmerican citizens have been harmed because foreign governments refuse to take back their citizens,\xe2\x80\x9d Thomas Homan, acting director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, said in a Department of Homeland Security statement. \nIn each case, there are exceptions for citizens of the four nations who apply for visas from outside their countries, as well as exceptions on humanitarian grounds or for travel \xe2\x80\x9cdeemed in the interest of the United States.\xe2\x80\x9d \nThe new rules, which go into effect on Wednesday, do not affect visas that already have been granted. \nVisa sanctions are allowed by U.S. immigration law to punish countries that refuse to accept their citizens back from the United States. In practice, the United States has rarely taken that step - just twice in the past decade and a half, according to a Department of Homeland Security spokesman. \nThe most recent instance was in October 2016 when the Obama administration stopped issuing visas\xc2\xa0to Gambian government officials and their families because the government was not taking back U.S. deportees from Gambia.\xc2\xa0 \nThree of the four countries included in the current visa restrictions - Cambodia, Guinea, and Eritrea - were on a July list of nations deemed \xe2\x80\x9crecalcitrant\xe2\x80\x9d by U.S. immigration authorities. It was unclear immediately why Sierra Leone was included in Tuesday\xe2\x80\x99s action even though it was not on the \xe2\x80\x9crecalcitrant\xe2\x80\x9d list in July.  \nICE has had to release roughly 2,137 Guineans and 831 Sierra Leone nationals, many with \xe2\x80\x9cserious criminal convictions,\xe2\x80\x9d the DHS statement said. In addition, around 700 Eritreans and more than 1,900 Cambodians are living in the United States who have been ordered removed, DHS said. \nDHS officials say in some cases, the agency has had no choice but to release convicted criminals who served prison time but could not be returned to their home country because it refused to take them back. \nThe Trump administration has made it a priority to pressure reluctant countries to take back their citizens. As of July, the 12 nations deemed \xe2\x80\x9crecalcitrant\xe2\x80\x9d were China, Cuba, Vietnam, Laos, Iran, Cambodia, Burma, Morocco, Hong Kong, South Sudan, Guinea and Eritrea. \nAccording to 2016 congressional testimony by Michele Bond, former assistant secretary of state for consular affairs, Cuba was the \xe2\x80\x9cmost recalcitrant country on repatriation of its nationals,\xe2\x80\x9d although she did not give numbers. \nOther countries then at the top of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) list of recalcitrant countries were China, Somalia and India, Bond said at the time. None of those countries are facing visa sanctions. \n'

aS' Amazon.com Inc  is preparing to open a 1 million square-foot warehouse near Mexico City, sources familiar with the project said, part of an effort to boost its presence in Mexico\xe2\x80\x99s nascent e-commerce industry. \nThe new warehouse is slated to be built in the Tepotzotlan municipality about 25 miles (40 km) north of the Mexican capital, according to four Mexico City real estate professionals familiar with the plans. Expected to be completed next year, the facility would triple Amazon\xe2\x80\x99s distribution space in Mexico, home to around 120 million potential customers. \nAmazon\xe2\x80\x99s Mexico push comes amid talks to revamp the North American Free Trade Agreement, which could benefit the Seattle-based retailer if the United States persuades Mexico to raise a $50 limit on the value of online purchases that can be imported duty-free. \nAmazon is a relative newcomer to Mexico; it opened its Kindle e-books site to Mexican customers in 2013 and expanded into sales of physical goods just two years ago. But it is growing much faster than rivals such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc, and is already the nation\xe2\x80\x99s third-largest online retailer. Amazon posted $253 million in sales in Mexico last year, more than double the year before, according to market research firm Euromonitor International. \nSharing a nearly 2,000-mile long border with the United States, Mexico would seem a logical place for Amazon to expand. But duplicating the company\xe2\x80\x99s U.S.-style success could prove tougher. \nOnline shopping comprises nearly 3 percent of all retail sales in Mexico compared with over 10 percent in the United States. Some Mexican shoppers are wary of online fraud and many do not have credit cards. \nSome analysts believe Amazon is willing to take the risk as it races to bulk up in foreign markets to compete with fast-moving global competitors such as China\xe2\x80\x99s Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. \n\xe2\x80\x9cAmazon is not afraid to plow into a new market in a very big way, take a big hit, but say, 10 years down the line, this is going to be big and profitable,\xe2\x80\x9d said Neil Saunders, managing director at the GlobalData Retail research firm.  \nAmazon spokesman Julio Gil declined to comment on plans for a new warehouse in Mexico. He said the company\xe2\x80\x99s Mexican unit is aiming to expand its product offerings, offer faster deliveries and make the purchasing process as smooth and secure as possible to inspire consumer confidence.  \n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re trying to eliminate any friction,\xe2\x80\x9d Gil said. \nAmazon\xe2\x80\x99s stock climbed more than 1 percent on Wednesday, reaching $994.10 a share by early afternoon.  \nAmazon currently operates two distribution centers in Mexico totaling more than 500,000 square feet (46,452 sq m), Gil said. Both are in Cuautitlan Izcalli in the state of Mexico, adjacent to the autonomous district of Mexico City, whose metro area is home to more than 20 million people. \nThe new warehouse will be constructed about 7 miles (11 km) from the existing facilities. All are located along the so-called \xe2\x80\x9cNAFTA\xe2\x80\x9d highway, an industrial belt that runs through Mexico\xe2\x80\x99s factory regions to the U.S. border.  \nThe new facility is being built by industrial developer Fibra Prologis, according to sources familiar with the plans. The Mexico-based real estate investment trust owns 34.2 million square feet (3.2 million sq m) of manufacturing and logistics space across Mexico. Prologis declined interview requests. \nAt 1 million square feet, the new facility would be able to distribute bulky products such as furniture, as well as small items like books and microwaves, a set-up Amazon uses in other foreign countries, said Marc Wulfraat, president of the logistics consultancy firm MWPVL International. \nIf about 85 percent of the space is used for small products \xe2\x80\x93 typical of a U.S. warehouse set-up \xe2\x80\x93 Amazon would be able to store 15 million products and make up to 1 million deliveries a day nationwide. It would likely employ 2,000 to 3,000 people to handle the shipments, Wulfraat said. \nThe location could also serve as a distribution point for products going north to the United States, added Saunders from GlobalData.  \n\xe2\x80\x9cAmazon is very fluid with its logistics,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cAs long as that border is reasonably open, Amazon is very agnostic.\xe2\x80\x9d \nAmazon\xe2\x80\x99s global operations stretch across 14 countries including Latin America\xe2\x80\x99s most populous nations, Brazil and Mexico. That footprint fueled $11.5 billion in net international sales in the second quarter, just over half the size of Amazon\xe2\x80\x99s North American sales.  \nAmazon\xe2\x80\x99s 2016 Mexico sales fell well behind the market leader, Argentina\xe2\x80\x99s MercadoLibre Inc, with $435 million in sales, according to Euromonitor. Still Amazon edged out No. 4 Wal-Mart and was neck-and-neck with third-place Linio, a division of Berlin-based Rocket Internet .  \nAll are fighting for loyalty from consumers largely unaccustomed to clickable shopping and wary of credit card and mail fraud.  \n\xe2\x80\x9cMuch of the reticence of Mexican shoppers to make purchases online is uncertainty,\xe2\x80\x9d said Carlos Hermosillo Bernal, an analyst at Actinver. \xe2\x80\x9cWill I get the product? Is it what was being offered? What guarantee do I have?\xe2\x80\x9d \nThat reluctance may fade as Mexico\xe2\x80\x99s middle- and upper-class millennials gain purchasing power.  \nMexico City-based college student Daniel Arturo Munoz Castro, 20, said he has purchased board games, smartphone accessories and t-shirts on Amazon\xe2\x80\x99s app. He appreciates the variety of products and ease of use, even though his father first thought it might be a scam. \n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not like other web pages when you order things, and perhaps they don\xe2\x80\x99t arrive. It\xe2\x80\x99s very safe,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.  \nStill, Mexico\xe2\x80\x99s vast wealth disparity and cultural differences lead some analysts to doubt whether Amazon can replicate a U.S. shopping concept. Amazon backed off from its investments in China, for example, after struggling to understand the local markets, said Gene Munster, managing partner at Loup Ventures.  \n\xe2\x80\x9cIf they largely failed in China, why try in Mexico, Brazil or India? The answer is they haven\xe2\x80\x99t failed yet in those areas, and they may be able to right the ship,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.  \nIf the United States, Mexico and Canada raise the value of online purchases that can be imported duty-free as part of a modernized North American Free Trade Agreement, Amazon may be poised to reap rewards in Mexico.  \nThe proposal, which is backed by U.S. trade representatives, would push the duty-free limit on imports to about $800 from thresholds of $50 in Mexico and C$20 ($16.5) in Canada. That would give consumers in those countries an incentive to buy big-ticket products online from the United States, an idea that President Donald Trump has championed in his \xe2\x80\x9cBuy American\xe2\x80\x9d agenda.  \nMexican negotiators, however, are treading cautiously amid push-back from Mexican industries such as textiles and footwear.   \n\xe2\x80\x9cWe have to find a middle point that does not damage our economies with extreme liberalization,\xe2\x80\x9d Mexico Economy Minister Ildefonso Guajardo said at the conclusion of NAFTA talks in Mexico City early this month. The next round is scheduled for Ottawa in late September.  \nInternational trade analyst Claude Barfield of the American Enterprise Institute anticipates that even a compromise is unlikely to dash Amazon\xe2\x80\x99s plans for Mexico. \n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t imagine this would be a deal-breaker,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \n(For a graphic, click \n) \n'

aS' From planes, radars and ships in the Baltics, NATO officials say they are watching Russia\xe2\x80\x99s biggest war games since 2013 with \xe2\x80\x9ccalm and confidence\xe2\x80\x9d, but many are unnerved about what they see as Moscow testing its ability to wage war against the West. \nNATO believes the exercises, officially starting on Thursday in Belarus, the Baltic Sea, western Russia and the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad, are already underway. It says they are larger than Moscow has publicized, numbering some 100,000 troops, and involve firing nuclear-capable ballistic missiles. \nCodenamed Zapad or \xe2\x80\x9cWest\xe2\x80\x9d, NATO officials say the drills will simulate a conflict with the U.S.-led alliance intended to show Russia\xe2\x80\x99s ability to mass large numbers of troops at very short notice in the event of a conflict. \n\xe2\x80\x9cNATO remains calm and vigilant,\xe2\x80\x9d NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said last week during a visit to an Estonian army base where British troops have been stationed since March. \nBut Lithuania\xe2\x80\x99s Defense Minister Raimundas Karoblis was less sanguine, voicing widely-felt fears that the drills risk triggering an accidental conflict or could allow Moscow to leave troops in neighboring Belarus. \n\xe2\x80\x9cWe can\xe2\x80\x99t be totally calm. There is a large foreign army massed next to Lithuanian territory,\xe2\x80\x9d he told Reuters. \nSome Western officials including the head of the U.S. Army in Europe, Gen. Ben Hodges, have raised concerns that Russia might use the drills as a \xe2\x80\x9cTrojan horse\xe2\x80\x9d to make incursions into Poland and Russian-speaking regions in the Baltics. \nThe Kremlin firmly rejects any such plans. Russia says some 13,000 troops from Russia and Belarus will be involved in the Sept. 14-20 drills, below an international threshold that requires large numbers of outside observers. \nNATO will send three experts to so-called \xe2\x80\x98visitor days\xe2\x80\x99 during the exercises, but a NATO official said these were no substitute for meeting internationally-agreed norms at such exercises that include talking to soldiers and briefings. \nMoscow says it is the West that threatens stability in eastern Europe because the U.S.-led NATO alliance has put a 4,000-strong multinational force in the Baltics and Poland. \nWrong-footed by Moscow in the recent past, with Russia\xe2\x80\x99s seizure of Crimea in 2014 and its intervention in Syria\xe2\x80\x99s war in 2015, NATO is distrustful of the Kremlin\xe2\x80\x99s public message. \nIn Crimea, Moscow proved a master of \xe2\x80\x9chybrid warfare\xe2\x80\x9d, with its mix of cyber attacks, disinformation campaigns and use of Russian and local forces without insignia.  \nOne senior European security official said Zapad would merge manoeuvres across Russia\xe2\x80\x99s four western military districts in a \xe2\x80\x9ccomplex, multi-dimensional aggressive, anti-NATO exercise\xe2\x80\x9d. \n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is all smoke and mirrors,\xe2\x80\x9d the official said, adding that the Soviet-era Zapad exercises that were revived in 1999 had included simulated nuclear strikes on Europe. \nNATO officials say they have been watching Russia\xe2\x80\x99s preparations for months, including the use of hundreds of rail cars to carry tanks and other heavy equipment into Belarus. \nAs a precaution, the U.S. Army has moved 600 paratroopers to the Baltics during Zapad and has taken over guardianship of the airspace of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia, which lack capable air forces and air defense systems.  \nNATO\xe2\x80\x98S NEXT MOVE? \nRussia\xe2\x80\x99s military show of force raises some uncomfortable questions for the alliance because NATO cannot yet mass large numbers of troops quickly, despite the United States\xe2\x80\x99 military might, NATO officials and diplomats said. \nNATO, a 29-nation defense pact created in 1949 to deter the Soviet threat, has already begun its biggest modernization since the Cold War, sending four battalions to the Baltics and Poland, setting up an agile, high-readiness spearhead force, and developing its cyberspace defenses. \nBut NATO has deliberately taken a slowly-slowly approach to its military build-up to avoid being sucked into a new arms race, even as Russia has stationed anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles in Kaliningrad, the Black Sea and Syria. \n\xe2\x80\x9cThe last thing we want is a military escalation with Russia,\xe2\x80\x9d said one senior NATO official involved in military planning, referring to Zapad.  \nIn the event of any potential Russian incursion into the Baltics or Poland, NATO\xe2\x80\x99s new multinational forces would quickly need large reinforcements. But a 40,000-strong force agreed in 2015 is still being developed, officials say. \nLithuania\xe2\x80\x99s Karoblis said he hoped to see progress by the next summit of NATO leaders in July 2018. \nBaltic politicians want more discretion given to NATO to fight any aggressor in the event of an attack, without waiting for the go-ahead from allied governments.  \nDuring Zapad, NATO is taking a low-key approach by running few exercises, including an annual sniper exercise in Lithuania. Only non-NATO member Sweden is holding a large-scale drill.     \nNATO Deputy Supreme Allied Commander Europe James Everard told Reuters there was no need to mirror Zapad. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not a competition,\xe2\x80\x9d he said during a visit to NATO forces in Latvia. \n'

aS' U.S. President Donald Trump urged United Nations member states on Tuesday to turn up the pressure on North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons, using his maiden speech to the world body to address what he has said is the top global challenge. \nBeginning his speech shortly after arriving at U.N. headquarters in New York, Trump said the world faces destructive threats from rogue states and \xe2\x80\x9cterrorists and extremists.\xe2\x80\x9d \n\xe2\x80\x9cRogue regimes not only support terrorists but threaten other nations with the most destructive weapon known to humanity,\xe2\x80\x9d Trump said, referring to nuclear weapons. \nIt was Trump\xe2\x80\x99s first appearance in the green-marbled U.N. General Assembly hall, where applause from world leaders is generally muted. \n Reading carefully from a script, Trump promised the United States military would soon be the strongest it has ever been. \nTrump, who came to power promoting an America First agenda, told world leaders that the United States does not seek to impose its will on other nations and will respect other countries\xe2\x80\x99 sovereignty.  \n\xe2\x80\x9cI will defend America\xe2\x80\x99s interests above all else,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cBut in fulfilling our obligations to other nations we also realize it\xe2\x80\x99s in everyone\xe2\x80\x99s interest to seek a future where all nations can be sovereign, prosperous and secure.\xe2\x80\x9d     \n'

aS' Myanmar leader Aung San Suu Kyi condemned on Tuesday human rights violations in Rakhine state and said violators would be brought to book, but she did not address U.N. accusations of a campaign of ethnic cleansing by the military. \nThe Nobel Peace laureate\xe2\x80\x99s remarks came in her first address to the nation since attacks by Rohingya Muslim insurgents on Aug. 25 sparked a military response that has forced 421,000 Rohingya Muslims into neighboring Bangladesh. \nWestern diplomats and aid officials, hoping for an unequivocal condemnation of violence and hate speech, welcomed the tone of Suu Kyi\xe2\x80\x99s message, but some doubted if she had done enough to deflect global criticism. \nHuman rights group Amnesty International described her speech as \xe2\x80\x9clittle more than a mix of untruths and victim-blaming\xe2\x80\x9d, saying she and her government were \xe2\x80\x9cburying their heads in the sand\xe2\x80\x9d for ignoring the army\xe2\x80\x99s role in the violence. \n\xe2\x80\x9cWe condemn all human rights violations and unlawful violence. We are committed to the restoration of peace and stability and rule of law throughout the state,\xe2\x80\x9d Suu Kyi said in her address in the capital, Naypyitaw. \n\xe2\x80\x9cAction will be taken against all people, regardless of their religion, race and political position, who go against the law of the land and violate human rights,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \nLong feted in the West as a champion of democracy in the Buddhist-majority country during years of military rule and house arrest, Suu Kyi has faced growing criticism for saying little about abuses faced by the Rohingya. \nThe United States urged Myanmar on Monday to end military operations, grant humanitarian access, and commit to aiding the safe return of civilians to their homes. \nMyanmar\xe2\x80\x99s generals remain in full charge of security and Suu Kyi did not comment on the military or its operation, except to say there had been \xe2\x80\x9cno armed clashes and there have been no clearance operations\xe2\x80\x9d since Sept. 5. \nRohingya refugees arriving in Bangladesh have told of soldiers and Buddhist civilians attacking and burning villages as recently as last Friday. It was not possible to verify their accounts. \nRights monitors and fleeing Rohingya say the army and Rakhine Buddhist vigilantes have mounted a campaign of arson aimed at driving out the Muslim population. The U.N. rights agency said it was \xe2\x80\x9ca textbook example of ethnic cleansing\xe2\x80\x9d. \nMyanmar rejects that, saying its forces are tackling insurgents of the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA), which has claimed responsibility for attacks since October. The government has declared it a terrorist group and accused it of setting the fires and attacking civilians. \nWestern governments that backed Suu Kyi\xe2\x80\x99s campaign against military rule still see her as the best hope for Myanmar\xe2\x80\x99s political and economic transition. \nBut she has to avoid angering the powerful army. \nShe also has to avoid alienating her supporters by being seen to take the side of a Muslim minority that enjoys little sympathy in a country that has seen a surge of Buddhist nationalism. \nSome diplomats said she had not squarely addressed the problem of violence in her speech.  \nBut her domestic audience was happy. \nThousands of supporters cheered and let balloons float into the sky in the main city of Yangon as they watched her speech on a big screen. Social media saw a blizzard of posts with the message: \xe2\x80\x9cWe stand with Aung San Suu Kyi\xe2\x80\x9d. \nThe military spokesman was not available for comment. One official familiar with the military\xe2\x80\x99s thinking said it would have no objection to her speech. \nPhil Robertson of Human Rights Watch said satellite images showed about half of all Rohingya villages had been torched and it was time that Suu Kyi, the government and military faced the fact that the security forces \xe2\x80\x9cshoot and kill who they want\xe2\x80\x9d and burn villages. \nAmnesty International said there was \xe2\x80\x9coverwhelming evidence\xe2\x80\x9d the security forces were engaged in ethnic cleansing.  \n\xe2\x80\x9cWhile it was positive to hear Aung San Suu Kyi condemn human rights violations in Rakhine state, she is still silent about the role of the security forces,\xe2\x80\x9d the group said. \n\xe2\x80\x98READY TO EXPLODE\xe2\x80\x99 \nIn Geneva, the head of a U.N. investigation into the violence said his team had heard testimony that suggested Myanmar\xe2\x80\x99s security forces may be committing rights violations. \n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat they have come up with reflects in general the reporting of the international media,\xe2\x80\x9d Marzuki Darusman said, referring to a small team of investigators talking to refugees in Bangladesh. \nMyanmar has declined to issue visas to Darusman\xe2\x80\x99s team but he said was more hopeful, following Suu Kyi\xe2\x80\x99s speech in which she spoke of allowing diplomats access to Rakhine state. \nSuu Kyi, 72, said her government had been promoting harmony between the Muslim and largely Buddhist ethnic Rakhine communities. But a government official there did not share her optimism. \n\xe2\x80\x9cThey have no trust for each other,\xe2\x80\x9d the state\xe2\x80\x99s secretary, Tin Maung Swe, told Reuters, adding tension was high. \n\xe2\x80\x9cThe situation is ready to explode.\xe2\x80\x9d \nSuu Kyi said she was committed to recommendations made by an advisory team led by former U.N. secretary-general Kofi Annan, which last month suggested a review of a law that links  citizenship and ethnicity and leaves most Rohingya stateless. \nOn the return of refugees, Suu Kyi said Myanmar was ready to start a verification process and \xe2\x80\x9crefugees from this country will be accepted without any problem\xe2\x80\x9d. \nThe U.N. children\xe2\x80\x99s agency said a quarter of a million children were among the refugees. \n'

aS'For all of Sunset Park\xe2\x80\x99s celebrated taquerias, dim sum parlors and picturesque piers, the most popular destination in that neighborhood might just be the local branch of the Brooklyn Public Library. Despite its squat concrete frame and fluorescent lights \xe2\x80\x94 a far cry from the neighboring brownstones \xe2\x80\x94 the library draws a capacity crowd most days.\nOn a recent afternoon, students from down the block and around the world scribbled out homework, studied with tutors, practiced English and honed their chess skills. On the walls, posters promoted not just reading but citizenship services and business-planning classes. Parents and children alike sat at banks of computers, indulging in a world of knowledge that many New Yorkers take for granted.\nIt was a hive of activity, one that actually buzzed. Four portable air-conditioners the size of refrigerators blasted air through coiled ducts. One could be forgiven for thinking the place was being fumigated, but really, the central air was broken and has been for years.\nThe patrons of the Sunset Park library, one of the 20 busiest in the city, are hardly alone in their love for, and frustration with, their local branch. Demand for libraries reaches new highs with each passing year (nearly 34 million visits in 2016), while many of New York\xe2\x80\x99s branches are woefully outmoded (the average library is 62 years old).\nNew York, graced with \n, was foundational in the library movement. Today, those foundations are crumbling. Despite their popularity, and because of it, the city\xe2\x80\x99s 212 branches face nearly $1.5 billion in capital needs. And that is simply to reach a state of good repair.\nChipping away at these needs can seem overwhelming. But New York has an opportunity, one shared by cities across the country, to improve library infrastructure while creating badly needed housing. By using aging branches as sites for development, new libraries may rise with affordable apartments on top. The administration of Mayor Bill de Blasio should seize the chance at sites citywide to link these crucial needs.\nMichelle de la Uz has made a career of tackling complicated affordable housing projects. As the executive director of the Fifth Avenue Committee, she has helped build hundreds of units inside developments that include community spaces, medical offices and prekindergartens. \xe2\x80\x9cIt shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t just be the communities that can support these projects \xe2\x80\x94 every neighborhood, and every community, deserves great civic spaces,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ms. de la Uz, who is also a city planning commissioner.\nIn 2014, the city selected the Fifth Avenue Committee to undertake the novel task of redeveloping the Sunset Park branch. There, an eight-story building will rise, with the first two floors dedicated to a library 75 percent larger than the one there now. The floors above will have 49 apartments, all of which will be rented to low- and middle-income families in perpetuity.\nImagine if the city did the same at the branch in Corona, Queens, where cramped quarters force study groups to huddle on the floor; or Red Hook, Brooklyn, where families from the nearby housing projects are eager for more job training; or Brighton Beach, Brooklyn, where rising sea levels and storms like Sandy threaten its very operations.\nSome might complain that such public-private partnerships do not earn the libraries enough space or money, or that the resulting buildings are too big. Such criticism ignores the complexities of building in the country\xe2\x80\x99s oldest and largest metropolis. These deals do not undermine the libraries within \xe2\x80\x94 they underpin their futures. When cities lack housing, new libraries and capital dollars, here is a way to get all three for the nominal public investment of an underused property, one the public continues to own once it is built.\nIndeed, New York has already undertaken a number of library partnerships that underscore their promise.\nAcross from the Museum of Modern Art, a new 53rd Street branch has opened beneath a luxury hotel to \n positive \n. New residential towers, from Battery Park City to the BAM Cultural District in Fort Greene, have incorporated libraries. A similar development underway in Brooklyn Heights has drawn criticism for having only market-rate apartments; this overlooks the $52 million earned in the deal, which is underwriting the Sunset Park project, among others.\nAdmirable as these are, New York has fallen well short of its potential. The city has built only 16 branches the past two decades, a paltry 8 percent increase, and nothing compared with rival metropolitan areas.\nOther cities are much further ahead. Starting in 1995, Chicago created a master plan tying libraries to community development and has replaced more than three-quarters of its branches. In 1998, Seattle issued the largest library bond in history, allowing for the construction or replacement of all 27 branches. And Columbus, Ohio, unveiled a plan to double, and possibly triple, its system\xe2\x80\x99s square footage over two decades.\nNew York ought to take such an integrated approach to the billion-dollar needs of its libraries. At the very least, it should embrace the partnerships already flourishing here and foster even more.\nMy organization, the Center for an Urban Future, working with the architecture firm Marble Fairbanks, has identified \n. These could easily be redeveloped into libraries beneath housing, or even offices or manufacturing centers, depending on a community\xe2\x80\x99s needs. Factoring in some smart rezonings, dozens more libraries could be upgraded in this fashion.\nThe Robin Hood Foundation is seeking to nurture this model. In 2015, the foundation offered the de Blasio administration a challenge grant of $25 million, to be divided among five libraries, one in each borough. A $5 million match from the city effectively covers the cost of building out a library, which would be in a new affordable housing complex. It is akin to the venture in Sunset Park.\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe city has used up most of its vacant land, so we really have to get creative about our existing resources,\xe2\x80\x9d said Beatriz De La Torre, Robin Hood\xe2\x80\x99s managing director of housing.\nSo far, the administration is piloting this effort in only one location, \n on the upper reaches of Broadway. But many neighborhoods are clamoring for both affordable housing and expanded library services.\nLibraries have become 21st-century settlement houses, providing a world of resources under one roof. They help bridge the digital divide, invest in early literacy and lifelong learning, increase language skills and serve as civic hubs. Let\xe2\x80\x99s add affordable housing to the list.\n'

aS'ZAGREB, Croatia \xe2\x80\x94 In Sarajevo, Yugoslavia, during the 1984 Winter Olympics, Elvis J. Kurtovic and his Meteors were performing \n in a stifling little basement hall before 300 wild punk rock fans. But it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t Dylan\xe2\x80\x99s rendition they were playing, it was their own, a deliberate extension that ostensibly was about the Margaret Thatcher, the prime minister of Britain. But \nElvis J. Kurtovic and his Meteors were singing about \xe2\x80\x94 in an extremely brutal way that should have been unacceptable to the Communist authorities \xe2\x80\x94 Yugoslavia\xe2\x80\x99s own prime minister, \n.\nIt was a brilliant trading of identities that mocked the Yugoslav regime and its ideology while playing with the form and content of a three-minute punk song. It could be included in any global anthology of protest punk, though the editors would have to have heard of this strange Sarajevo group, which was led by Mirko Srdic, a 22-year-old engineering student and one of the cleverest and most lucid authors on the Yugoslav rock scene.\nIn their version of the song, Elvis J. Kurtovic and his Meteors accused Planinc \xe2\x80\x94 all while calling her Margaret Thatcher \xe2\x80\x94 of ineptitude and corruption in Kosovo, then a rebellious Yugoslav province. If a journalist had tried to publish anything of the sort, she would have ended up in prison and been banned forever from working for Yugoslav papers. If an ordinary citizen had talked like this in a cafe or on a tram, he would at the very least have been investigated by the police for \xe2\x80\x9cspreading false reports and alarming the public.\xe2\x80\x9d But this was a song that referred to Margaret Thatcher. The police and the Communist Party pretended that it really was about Thatcher, and nothing happened.\nPunk rock appeared early in Yugoslavia. Yugoslav punk bands already existed by 1977, the year the Clash released its first album in Britain. The first major punk concert, at least that I remember, took place in Pula, a town on the Croatian coast, on March 22, 1978. Soon after, the first LPs came out from bands like Pankrti, from Ljubljana, whose name in Slovene means \xe2\x80\x9cillegitimate\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cbastard children.\xe2\x80\x9d These records were released through state-run record companies, which were under a kind of informal but ever-present party censorship.\nFrom the standpoint of the regime these groups had extremely problematic lyrics. They attacked the police, the authorities and the tenets of Communist ideology. But still, they were sung and published with virtually no interference. The reason was simple: It is less dangerous for something to exist in the shop windows of record stores and on the stages of Party-sponsored \xe2\x80\x9chouses of culture\xe2\x80\x9d than for it to live underground, conspiring against the system. Such was the strategy of the leaders at the time, a group that would be further liberalized after the death of Yugoslavia\xe2\x80\x99s lifelong president, Marshal Josip Broz Tito, in the spring of 1980.\nLike its British and American counterparts, Yugoslav punk rock was steeped in social scandal and radical political engagement. It was a time when people were able to make a good living, and young people could find regular paid work through youth services (a Party invention that allowed high school and college students to work for money in their spare time), and with their earnings they would go to the Italian border city of Trieste or to Vienna or even to London to witness the new subcultural trends and buy records. Because of this, the music of punk classics like the Clash, the Sex Pistols, the Buzzcocks and the Damned found its way to Yugoslavia, along with that of Patti Smith, the Stooges and New York Dolls.\nNot everything was the same for us in Yugoslavia as it was in New York or London, though. Yugoslav punk was based on rebellion, with the youth escapism that characterized some parts of the punk scene in the West almost completely absent. Punk rock in Yugoslavia emerged and developed as a way to blaspheme the government and everything \xe2\x80\x94 or almost everything \xe2\x80\x94 that our parents\xe2\x80\x99 generation believed in. The artistry consisted in writing songs that would be more anti-establishment than any before but would not be censored. There was just one topic that was untouchable: Tito. Everything else was allowed. One could sing more or less openly against everything. Even against Communism.\nSome of these songs sounded like everyday political commentary. During the great strike in the shipyards in Gdansk, Poland, when the labor movement Solidarity, led by the electrician Lech Walesa, had just been formed and was gaining support, the band Azra, from Zagreb, performed \n all around Yugoslavia. The song described actual events, railed against the Soviet Union and even mentioned Pope John Paul II. The Soviet Embassy in Belgrade sent an official note to object to the song, but it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t banned The recording of \xe2\x80\x9cPoland in My Heart\xe2\x80\x9d was actually issued by Jugoton, then the largest and most influential record label in the country.\nThe ideology of Yugoslav punk boiled down to anti-Communism, conscious or unconscious. And here again is the intriguing paradox: Why did the Communist authorities allow an anti-Communist youth subculture to flourish? Yes, it was a useful outlet for youth rebellion. But the other answer to this question became clearer a decade later.\nIn 1990 and \xe2\x80\x9991, Yugoslavia collapsed and Communism was replaced by ethno-nationalism. That was when the old world would destroy itself from within, and yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s Communists, the heads of secret agencies and central committees, would seize power in the Yugoslav republics with lightning speed, transforming themselves into nationalists and right-wingers. The people who at the beginning of the \xe2\x80\x9980s were convening Party conferences to discuss anti-Communist excesses and in the 1990s would take control of the newly established countries never cared much about anti-Communism; they cared about power.\nPunk and New Wave music in Yugoslavia in the early \xe2\x80\x9980s was a unique phenomenon in the Communist world. In the other countries of Eastern Europe \xe2\x80\x94 with the partial exception of Poland \xe2\x80\x94 punk rock truly appeared only once Communism had practically ceased to be. Russian punk rockers, notably the women from Pussy Riot, revolted against a conservative, Vladimir Putin, at a time when Communism had faded into the past. Punk rock arrived in Russia \xe2\x80\x94 as it had somewhat earlier in Hungary, Poland and Czechoslovakia \xe2\x80\x94 as a tardy echo of something that had taken place long before in the West, and usually it was merely an imitation of American and British models.\nFor many years, this was how popular and youth culture developed in Yugoslavia, too. But with the liberalization of the political regime, and with the material enrichment of society and the expansion of the middle class, things had begun to change radically by the end of the \xe2\x80\x9970s. In 1968, just a year after it was produced in New York, the Broadway musical \xe2\x80\x9cHair\xe2\x80\x9d was staged in Belgrade, a landmark event in Yugoslav popular culture. From Belgrade\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cHair\xe2\x80\x9d to Yugoslav punk rock, and then until the fall of Yugoslavia, things played out largely in synchronicity with the West.\nIn contrast to the Soviet Union and most other Eastern European Communist Parties, whose leaders and commissars saw control of culture, particularly popular and youth culture, as a means of safeguarding their power, the Yugoslav Communists offered culture to their citizens, especially the young, as an outlet to safely relieve social trauma, one that would also present the illusion of freedom. Simply put, in contrast to the Leonid Brezhnev of the Soviet Union, Tito did not think that young people with drums and guitars would bring down the state. And in the end, he was right.\n'

aS' As deaths mount in America\xe2\x80\x99s opioid crisis, communities on the front lines face a hidden toll: the financial cost. \nRoss County, a largely rural region of 77,000 people an hour south of Columbus, Ohio, is wrestling with an explosion in opioid-related deaths - 44 last year compared to 19 in 2009. The drug addiction epidemic is shattering not just lives but also stressing the county budget. \nAbout 75 percent of the 200 children placed into state care in the county have parents with opioid addictions, up from about 40 percent five years ago, local officials say. Their care is more expensive because they need specialist counseling, longer stays and therapy. \nThat has caused a near doubling in the county\xe2\x80\x99s child services budget to almost $2.4 million from $1.3 million, said Doug Corcoran, a county commissioner. \nFor a county with a general fund of just $23 million, that is a big financial burden, Corcoran said. He and his colleagues are now exploring what they might cut to pay for the growing costs of the epidemic, such as youth programs and economic development schemes. \n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s very little discretionary spending in our budget to cut. It\xe2\x80\x99s really tough,\xe2\x80\x9d Corcoran said. \nCities, towns and counties across the United States are struggling to deal with the financial costs of a drug addiction epidemic that killed 33,000 people in 2015 alone, data and interviews with more than two dozen local officials and county budget professionals shows. (For graphics on the opioid crisis click here: \n) \nThe interviews and data provide one of the first glimpses into the financial impact on local governments but it is far from complete because there is no central database collating information from counties and states. So, the true scale is still mostly hidden from view. \nOpioids, primarily prescription painkillers, heroin and fentanyl - a drug 50 to 100 times more powerful than morphine - are fueling the drug overdoses. \nPresident Donald Trump last month called the epidemic a \xe2\x80\x9cnational emergency\xe2\x80\x9d but has not yet made an official national emergency declaration. Such a move would give states access to federal funds to fight it. \nCounties grappling with rising overdoses face higher costs in emergency call volumes, medical examiner and coroner bills, and overcrowded jails and courtrooms, said Matt Chase, executive director of the National Association of Counties, which represents 3,069 county and local governments. \nAt his group\xe2\x80\x99s July annual meeting, a presentation where county officials shared tips on tackling the opioid crisis, and the budget problems the crisis is triggering, played to a packed room, Chase said. \nThe organization is in the early stage of collecting information to build a more complete picture of the financial impact of the crisis on county budgets, Chase said. \nIndiana County, Pennsylvania, a mountainous, predominantly rural region, provides a snapshot of how the crisis is stressing local services and budgets. \nIts county seat, the borough of Indiana, is home to a modern college campus and a main street lined by restaurants and American flags. Yet beneath its outward tranquility, the opioid epidemic is everywhere, said David Rostis, an undercover detective and head of the county\xe2\x80\x99s drug task force. \nOn a recent ride-along in Rostis\xe2\x80\x99 car, he points to a building where a doctor used to sell opioid prescriptions for sex; a large, affluent home where a teenager died of an overdose; a trail where a drug-related killing recently occurred; and the local gas station where a woman recently overdosed and died in her car while people passed by. \nIn 2016, the county\xe2\x80\x99s drug overdose death rate was 50.6 deaths per 100,000, compared to the state average of 36.5.  \nAutopsy and toxicology costs there have nearly doubled in six years, from about $89,000 in 2010 to $165,000 in 2016, county data shows. \nCourt costs are soaring, mainly because of the expense of prosecuting opioid-related crimes and providing accused with a public defender, local officials say. \nThe county is using contingency funds to pay for the added coroner costs, said Mike Baker, the county\xe2\x80\x99s top government official. Last year, the county drew $63,000 from those funds, up from $19,000 in 2014, he said.\xc2\xa0In 2014, the county saw 10 drug-related deaths. In 2016, the number had grown to 53. \nIn Mercer County, West Virginia, 300 miles (483 km) to the south of Indiana County, opioid-related jail costs are carving into the small annual budget of $12 million for the community of 62,000 people.  \nThe county\xe2\x80\x99s jail expenses are on course to increase by $100,000 this year, compared to 2015. The county pays $48.50 per inmate per day to the jail, and this year the jail is on course to have over 2,000 more \xe2\x80\x9cinmate days\xe2\x80\x9d compared to 2015, according to county data. \n\xe2\x80\x9cAt least 90 percent of those extra jail costs are opioid-related,\xe2\x80\x9d said Greg Puckett, a county commissioner who sits on a national county opioid task force. \xe2\x80\x9cWe spend more in one month on our jail bill than we spend per month on economic development, our health department and our emergency services combined.\xe2\x80\x9d \nWest Virginia has been on the front line of the opioid crisis. In 2015, the state led the nation in drug overdose death rates for the third consecutive year. Preliminary numbers for 2016 recorded 883 drug overdose deaths, with 755 involving at least one opioid, up from 629 total deaths in 2014. \nFew know the opioid crisis like the father-son duo Sidney and Curtis Goldblatt. The pair run two companies, ForensicDx for autopsies and MolecularDx for drug testing, out of Windber, Pennsylvania. Together they conduct autopsies for 10 Pennsylvania counties, including Indiana, charging between $2,000 and $3,000 per body. \nIn 2014, overdoses represented about 40 percent of the deaths they handled, the Goldblatts said. Last year, that shot up to 62 percent. Goldblatt senior has been performing autopsies for 50 years and says he has never seen anything on the scale of the current epidemic. When he started, a drug overdose was rare. \nThe pair opened ForensicDx in 2014 with a staff of three, serving only three counties. That\xe2\x80\x99s grown to seven staff and 10 counties, mainly to meet demand from drug-related deaths, the Goldblatts said. \nIndiana County\xe2\x80\x99s ambulance service is also under financial stress because of the opioid crisis. The county\xe2\x80\x99s primary ambulance provider, Citizens\xe2\x80\x99 Ambulance Service, has lost more than $100,000 since 2016 alone on opioid calls, said Randy Thomas, director of operations. \nThe non-profit is reimbursed only if an opioid overdose patient is transported to the hospital. It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t get paid for successfully treating people who have overdosed but then refuse to go to the hospital, Thomas said. \nPeople brought back from the brink of death after a dose of the life-saving drug naloxone, also known as Narcan, often awake angry and combative and refuse hospitalization, Thomas said. \nAs costs related to the opioid epidemic increase, Indiana County commissioner Baker isn\xe2\x80\x99t sure what will happen next. Unless the state or federal government intervene, the county will have to either cut services or increase taxes, Baker said. \n\xe2\x80\x9cThis has introduced an entirely different metric, an entirely different level of unpredictability in budgeting,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \nFor all the budget problems Baker faces because of the crisis, the human toll is what distresses him most. Last fall, Baker\xe2\x80\x99s nephew died of a fentanyl overdose.\xc2\xa0He was 23. Talking about his nephew\xe2\x80\x99s death, Baker pauses to collect his thoughts. \n\xe2\x80\x9dIt is a most painful and difficult experience and I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t wish it on anyone in the world,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \n'

aS' Activists in St. Louis plan to voice their concerns directly to the mayor on Tuesday over the acquittal of a white policeman who shot a black man to death, a verdict that sparked four night of violent protest. \nMayor Lyda Krewson will speak with residents at a town hall meeting at a local high school, hoping to defuse tensions in a city where demonstrators have clashed with police and destroyed property.  \n\xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s show up and hold Mayor Lyda Krewson accountable,\xe2\x80\x9d Resist - STL, an activist group, said on Facebook.  \nThe town hall meeting comes four days after a judge found former police officer Jason Stockley, 36, not guilty of first-degree murder in the 2011 killing of Anthony Lamar Smith, 24. \nLargely peaceful protests during the day have turned violent at night with some demonstrators carrying guns, bats and hammers, smashing windows, clashing with police and blocking traffic. \nPolice arrested 123 people on Sunday, when officers in riot gear used pepper spray on activists who defied orders to disperse following larger, peaceful protests. Several hundred people marched again on Monday night in a peaceful demonstration as on-and-off rain appeared to keep some at home.  \nSt. Louis police are investigating whether some of its officers chanted \xe2\x80\x9cWhose streets? Our streets,\xe2\x80\x9d appropriating a refrain used by the protesters themselves in what one official said could inflame tensions.   \nA grainy video posted online showed a group of officers and the chant can be heard. A St. Louis Post-Dispatch photographer, David Carson, tweeted that he and others heard officers chant the phrase. \nNicolle Barton, executive director of the St. Louis police civilian oversight board, said: \xe2\x80\x9cCertainly we do not want that to be taking place.\xe2\x80\x9d \nThe clashes have evoked memories of riots following the 2014 shooting of a black teenager by a white officer in nearby Ferguson. \n'

aS' Toys \xe2\x80\x98R\xe2\x80\x99 Us Inc, the largest U.S. toy store chain, filed for bankruptcy protection late Monday, the latest sign of turmoil in the retail industry that is caught in a viselike grip of online shopping and discount chains. \nThe Chapter 11 filing is among the largest ever by a specialty retailer and casts doubt over the future of its about 1,600 stores and 64,000 employees. It comes just as Toys \xe2\x80\x98R\xe2\x80\x99 Us is gearing up for the holiday shopping season, which accounts for the bulk of its sales. \n\xe2\x80\x9cWhile today\xe2\x80\x99s decision does not necessarily mean it is game over for Toys \xe2\x80\x98R\xe2\x80\x99 Us, it brings to a close a turbulent chapter in the iconic company\xe2\x80\x99s history,\xe2\x80\x9d said Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData Retail. \nToys \xe2\x80\x98R\xe2\x80\x99 Us received a commitment for over $3 billion in debtor-in-possession financing from lenders including a JPMorgan-led bank syndicate and certain existing lenders, said the Wayne, New Jersey-based company, which also operates the Babies \xe2\x80\x98R\xe2\x80\x99 Us chain. \nThe financing, subject to court approval, reassures its suppliers they will get paid for their Lego building blocks and Barbie dolls that are being shipped for the holiday season. \n\xe2\x80\x9cWe expect that the financial constraints that have held us back will be addressed in a lasting and effective way,\xe2\x80\x9d Chief Executive Dave Brandon said. \n\xe2\x80\x9cTogether with our investors, our objective is to work with our debtholders and other creditors to restructure the $5 billion of long-term debt on our balance sheet.\xe2\x80\x9d \nIts Canadian unit intends to seek protection in parallel proceedings under the Companies\xe2\x80\x99 Creditors Arrangement Act (CCAA) in the Ontario Superior Court of Justice, Toys \xe2\x80\x98R\xe2\x80\x99 Us said in a statement. \nOperations outside of the United States and Canada, including about 255 licensed stores and joint venture partnerships in Asia, which are separate entities, are not part of the bankruptcy proceedings, Toys \xe2\x80\x98R\xe2\x80\x99 Us said. \nThe company\xe2\x80\x99s Toys \xe2\x80\x98R\xe2\x80\x99 Us and Babies \xe2\x80\x98R\xe2\x80\x99 Us stores and e-commerce sites around the world are open for business, it said. \nThe company is saddled with debt from a $6.6 billion buyout in 2005 led by KKR & Co LP (\n) and Bain Capital LP, together with real estate investment trust Vornado Realty Trust (\n). \nToys \xe2\x80\x98R\xe2\x80\x99 Us has bonds coming due next year that have lost half their value this month, according to Thomson Reuters data, as investors have grown concerned about a possible bankruptcy. \nThe company opened a temporary store in New York City\xe2\x80\x99s Times Square this year to capture more holiday shoppers, almost two years after it closed its flagship store barely a block away, driven out by high rents. \n\xe2\x80\x9cVendors have cut them off based upon the rumors of the filing which has not been refuted,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jay Indyke, a bankruptcy attorney with the Cooley law firm. \nWith assets of $6.9 billion based on its most recent annual report, it\xe2\x80\x99s the second-largest retail bankruptcy, trailing the filing in 2002 by Kmart, which had $14.6 billion in assets, according to research firm Bankruptcydata.com. \nMore than a dozen significant retail chains have filed for bankruptcy this year. Among them were Perfumania Inc, apparel chains rue21 Inc and Gymboree Corp, discount shoe chain Payless Holdings LLC and designer clothing chain BCBG Max Azria Global Holdings LLC.  \nMajor retailers including Macy\xe2\x80\x99s Inc (\n) and Sears Holding Corp (\n) have closed hundreds of locations as they struggle to compete discounters such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc (\n) and Amazon.com Inc (\n). Amazon\xe2\x80\x99s recent acquisition of high-end grocer Whole Foods Markets Inc stirred speculation that the online giant will use its pricing power and huge reach among U.S. consumers to go after market share of traditional brick-and-mortar grocers. \nToys \xe2\x80\x98R\xe2\x80\x99 Us is the second-largest toy seller in the United States behind Amazon, according to consulting firm Kloster Trading Corp.  \n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat they have going for them is they are the last major player in their market,\xe2\x80\x9d said David Berliner, a partner and restructuring specialist with BDO Consulting. \n\xe2\x80\x9cThe vendors don\xe2\x80\x99t want to see them fail, so I think they have a good opportunity to survive.\xe2\x80\x9d \nToys \xe2\x80\x98R\xe2\x80\x99 Us filed the petition in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Eastern District of Virginia in Richmond, Virginia. \n'

aS' After months of Brexit talks that have made little progress and deepened rifts in her party, British Prime Minister Theresa May will try this week to put the negotiations on track and reassert her authority.  \nIn a speech in the Italian city of Florence, May will set out on Friday her vision for future ties with the European Union and try to fill an apparent policy vacuum that has left her Brexit team adopting what Brussels regards as wrecking tactics in the talks on unraveling four decades of union. \nThe 60-year-old leader has deliberately chosen an EU city to deliver the speech so that she can speak directly to the other 27 nations in the bloc, but has her work cut out in seizing back the initiative. \nMay has been largely quiet on Brexit since her Conservative Party lost its parliamentary majority in a June election that she need not have called, saying little beyond expressing her support for \xe2\x80\x9ca deep and special partnership\xe2\x80\x9d with the bloc once Britain leaves in March 2019. \nBut days before the speech, foreign minister Boris Johnson laid out his own Brexit vision, challenging her more cautious approach and exposing the fault lines in her party and government. \nEU negotiators are also frustrated with what they see as Britain\xe2\x80\x99s policy drift. At talks in August, British officials spent almost three hours picking holes in the legal basis for the bill that the EU expects London to pay to leave.  \nSources familiar with the presentation -- so detailed it stretched for 11 pages and was illustrated with 23 slides -- called it a show of legal muscle. But, as Brexit minister David Davis said, the meeting was even \xe2\x80\x9ctetchier than the one before\xe2\x80\x9d. \n\xe2\x80\x9cThe reason lawyers gave a two-and-a-half hour presentation is because no government minister had made a decision on policy,\xe2\x80\x9d said Andrew Hood, who was a legal adviser to former prime minister David Cameron and still has contact with lawyers in several government departments. \nThe August talks were almost canceled by the EU side because of Britain\xe2\x80\x99s lack of position, Hood told Reuters. \xe2\x80\x9cI always thought when I was in the foreign office that if you ever need to revert to lawyers you\xe2\x80\x99ve probably lost,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \nHood now advises companies on their Brexit strategy for law firm Dechert but took part in meetings with the EU under Cameron, who resigned last year after Britons voted for Brexit. \nThe financial settlement with Brussels is one of the most difficult parts of the Brexit negotiations, but the lack of movement so far on even the mechanics of how to calculate the sum shows the difficulties facing Britain. \nMay is walking a tightrope between hardline Conservative Brexit supporters who want to make sure any payment is as small as possible, and some top ministers who believe Britain must pay to keep ties as close as possible. \nUntil now, she has largely let her government do the talking by setting out a wishlist for future relations with the bloc that aims for the closest of ties without the costs. May has also stuck to a belief that by playing her cards close to her chest, Britain will force EU negotiators into concessions. \nBut her silence has allowed other voices to emerge. The main opposition Labour Party says it would keep Britain in the single European market and customs union during a transitional period, the Liberal Democrats are demanding a second referendum and the Scottish National Party wants Scotland to remain part of the EU. \nTheir opposition is to be expected, but criticism from May\xe2\x80\x99s own team is not, and has raised eyebrows.  \nIn a weekend newspaper article, Johnson wrote that he did not expect Britain to pay for access to the EU\xe2\x80\x99s market, putting him at odds with finance minister Philip Hammond and May, who has spoken of paying in. \nAt the August talks, left without clear policy direction, Davis and his team\xe2\x80\x99s detailed dissection of the EU\xe2\x80\x99s arguments on the Brexit bill left the bloc\xe2\x80\x99s main negotiator Michel Barnier wondering whether \xe2\x80\x9cwe can build trust and start discussing a future relationship\xe2\x80\x9d. \nWeeks earlier, a former aide to May had praised the emerging agreement in her cabinet over the need for a transition deal and a divorce settlement -- something that seemed remote after last year\xe2\x80\x99s Brexit referendum.  \nBut though there may be agreement on this in principle, the difference lies in the detail and has opened a deep rift.  Hammond wants a transition as close as possible to the status quo while others, such as trade minister Liam Fox, do not want to stay in the single market or pay for access. \nPro-Brexit lawmakers have also balked at suggestions Britain should pay 60 billion euros ($72 billion) for the divorce, and May\xe2\x80\x99s aides have poured cold water on reports that there could be a compromise to reduce the headline figure by paying 10 billion pounds a year to the EU during a transition. \nIn a move that appeared intended to tighten her control over the Brexit talks, May appointed the top official at the Brexit ministry as her EU adviser on Monday. \nBut resetting the talks is a tough order, and aides are silent on whether May will use the Florence speech to try to break the deadlock on the financial settlement.  \nOfficials in Brussels are not holding their breath. \n\xe2\x80\x9cThe EU has taken the black veil off and is getting on with its life,\xe2\x80\x9d one EU official said after the August talks. \xe2\x80\x9cThe Brits are either completely overconfident or completely overwhelmed.\xe2\x80\x9d \n'

aS' German drugs and pesticides group Bayer (\n) said it would likely take until early next year to complete the planned $66 billion takeover of U.S. seeds group Monsanto (\n), which it had previously expected to be under wraps by the end of 2017. \nThe European Commission has been scrutinising the takeover with a deadline of Jan. 8. Bayer said in a statement it had asked the regulator for an extension to Jan. 22, to which the EU Commission responded by saying it would take a decision shortly. \nLiam Condon, head of Bayer\xe2\x80\x99s Crop Science division, said: \xe2\x80\x9cAn anticipated closing of the deal in early 2018 is now more likely than end of the 2017.\xe2\x80\x9d  \nThe Commission last month started an in-depth investigation of the takeover, saying it was worried about competition in various pesticide and seeds markets. \nAmong a slew of markets where competition was at risk, the EU Commission at the time named Monsanto\xe2\x80\x99s weed killer glyphosate, or Roundup, which competes with Bayer\xe2\x80\x99s glufosinate; vegetable and canola seeds; and licensing of cotton-seed technology to peers. \nMore broadly, it said the deal might slow the race to develop new products, and that the European Union would try to prevent Bayer from becoming too dominant in combined offerings of seeds and pesticides with the help of digital farming tools such as connected sensors, software and precision machines. \nBayer, which was holding a media event on its Crop Science business on Tuesday, also said the division would face volatile global markets for the rest of the year but would slowly return to growth from 2018, including its embattled Brazilian business. \nBayer warned in June that poor sales at crop protection distributors in Brazil would full-year hit earnings. \n'

aS" A northern Japanese city\xe2\x80\x99s efforts to rebuild its electric power system after the 2011 earthquake and tsunami mark a quiet shift away from the country\xe2\x80\x99s old utility model toward self-reliant, local generation and transmission.  \nAfter losing three-quarters of its homes and 1,100 people in the March 2011 temblor and tsunami, the city of Higashi Matsushima turned to the Japanese government\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cNational Resilience Program,\xe2\x80\x9d with 3.72 trillion yen ($33.32 billion) in funding for this fiscal year, to rebuild.  \nThe city of 40,000 chose to construct micro-grids and de-centralized renewable power generation to create a self-sustaining system capable of producing an average of 25 percent of its electricity without the need of the region\xe2\x80\x99s local power utility.  \nThe city\xe2\x80\x99s steps illustrate a massive yet little known effort to take dozens of Japan\xe2\x80\x99s towns and communities off the power grid and make them partly self-sufficient in generating electricity. \n\xe2\x80\x9cAt the time of the Great East Japan earthquake, we couldn\xe2\x80\x99t secure power and had to go through incredible hardships,\xe2\x80\x9d said Yusuke Atsumi, a manager at HOPE, the utility Higashi Matsushima created to manage the local generation and grid. \nUnder a large-scale power system a \xe2\x80\x9cblackout at one area would lead to wide-scale power outages. But the independent distributed micro-grid can sustain power even if the surrounding area is having a blackout.\xe2\x80\x9d \nThe Resilience Program is mainly for building back-up capabilities for Japan\xe2\x80\x99s cities and towns in the event of another disaster such as the earthquake and tsunami that caused meltdowns at the Fukushima nuclear power plant.  \nHowever, the Program has spurred the creation of micro-grids and distributed power generation across Japan that reduces municipalities dependence on large power plants.  \nJapan\xe2\x80\x99s government ministries are seeking to raise the budget for the Program by another 24 percent for the fiscal year starting in April 2018, the cabinet office said last month. \nThe money earmarked for this fiscal year is going in part to the creation of smart energy management systems and distributed generation systems in towns across Japan.   \n\xe2\x80\x9cSince Fukushima, there has been a gradual elaboration of policies to realize that kind of local autonomy, local consumption paradigm,\xe2\x80\x9d said Andrew Dewit, a professor of energy policy at Rikkyo University in Tokyo. \nDistributed generation uses small-scale power generation fueled by natural gas or solar and wind power arrays. Smart energy systems use the internet to connect appliances and meters to better direct electric power where and when its needed.  \nHigashi Matsushima has built its own independent transmission grid and solar generating panels as well as batteries to store power that can keep the city running for at least three days, according to Atsumi. \nCompanies in Japan are shifting their focus in response to the changes heralded by cities like Higashi Matsushima.  \nSekisui House (\n), Japan\xe2\x80\x99s biggest builder of detached homes, constructed Higashi Matsushima\xe2\x80\x99s smart micro-grid for 85 housing units in 2016.  \nTaisei Corp (\n), one of Japan\xe2\x80\x99s biggest construction companies, set up an energy strategy division this year to take advantage of the drive for smart energy systems.  \nThe company is planning to double energy-related orders to around 120 billion yen over the next five years, focusing on renewables, energy efficient buildings and smart communities, a spokesman said.  \nSteps taken by cities like Higashi Matsushima were the brainchild of Takao Kashiwagi, a professor at the International Research Centre for Advanced Energy Systems for Sustainability at the Tokyo Institute of Technology. \nHe designed Japan\xe2\x80\x99s first smart town and is the head of the New Energy Promotion Council that has paid out more than 100 billion yen in subsidies from the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry for smart energy communities. \n\xe2\x80\x9cWe are moving towards a day when we won\xe2\x80\x99t be building large-scale power plants. Instead, we will have distributed power systems, where small power supply systems are in place near the consumption areas,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \nFor a graphic on Japan's energy mix, click: \n \n"

aS'When my husband, the Venezuelan opposition leader and prisoner of conscience Leopoldo L\xc3\xb3pez, proposed to me in 2006, he told me that marrying him meant marrying Venezuela. I was wary of politics, but I was so moved by Leopoldo\xe2\x80\x99s idealism and love for our country that I said yes.\nAt that time, Leopoldo was the mayor of the Chacao district of Caracas. In 2009, a year after the government barred him from running for public office, he became a community organizer and founded the party Voluntad Popular (Popular Will). I was the mother of our two children and ran a local foundation.\nWe witnessed the \n under the regime of President Nicol\xc3\xa1s Maduro. Food became scarce and violence grew. But we believed that by keeping up our faith and staying strong in our protest we could overcome the \n and live in a free Venezuela.\nWe understood the unbreakable bond between human rights and democracy. Autocracy doesn\xe2\x80\x99t happen overnight; it\xe2\x80\x99s a slow transition. A regime that violates the rights of its people to fuel its own power and greed can\xe2\x80\x99t be considered legitimate. And without an honest commitment to human rights, democracy in Venezuela will die.\nOur life as we knew it came to an end on Feb. 18, 2014, when \n and I learned what it meant to marry Venezuela. He was working with students and fellow opposition leaders to organize nonviolent protests. In response, the regime called him a terrorist and \n with inciting violence. Rather than flee the country, Leopoldo turned himself in. He knew that he had nothing to hide and he wanted to unmask the regime as a dictatorship.\nLeopoldo spent the majority of his jail time in solitary confinement at the Ramo Verde military prison. He was denied private meetings with his lawyers, and all our communications were taped. Our son took his first steps in Leopoldo\xe2\x80\x99s jail cell.\nWith Leopoldo imprisoned, it fell to me to pick up his fight. At first, no one in the region would meet with me. The regime had seemingly convinced the world that Leopoldo was a radical. A few brave government officials asked to meet with me \xe2\x80\x94 but covertly, in coffee shops and hotel lobbies.\nI didn\xe2\x80\x99t give up, even after an opposition leader was shot dead just feet from me onstage at a public meeting in November 2015. Slowly the world has awakened to our plight. This summer, 12 members of the Organization of American States convened in Lima, Peru, to address the deepening crisis. In a \n, the bloc condemned \xe2\x80\x9cthe breakdown of democratic order\xe2\x80\x9d in Venezuela. It is a testament to how far we have come.\nOur neighbors finally seem to understand that they must take action. Signatories of the Inter-American Democratic Charter of the O.A.S. are sworn to preserve human rights and to protect democracy in the region. Failing to do so will have global repercussions \xe2\x80\x94 and will embolden other authoritarian states to tighten their grip.\nMuch has changed over the past three and a half years. Leopoldo is under \n, I am five months pregnant with our third child and government officials from around the world have welcomed us. But Venezuela is still racing toward catastrophe. The government is targeting me more than ever before. On September 1, I received a notice to appear in court with no specified charges. The next day I learned that I was barred from leaving the country. The regime thinks that by taking away my passport they will stop my human rights advocacy.\nThe Maduro regime makes a mockery of the United Nations\xe2\x80\x99 Universal Declaration of Human Rights. We have no freedom of speech; more than 600 people have been imprisoned for protesting the government. Unabated crime in the streets, paired with the regime\xe2\x80\x99s repression, means that we have no guarantee even of our right to life.\nVenezuela is in the midst of a humanitarian crisis, too. We\xe2\x80\x99re experiencing such severe shortages of food and \n that we are being denied the right to a healthy standard of living. In a survey last year led by three Venezuelan universities, three-fourths of respondents said they had \n \xe2\x80\x94 an average of 19 pounds each. Maternal and infant mortality rates have soared.\nThe regime also represses our political rights. Protests have been mostly peaceful, but government-armed forces have fired tear gas and buckshot into crowds \xe2\x80\x94 at short range. The death toll from protests since April has surpassed 120.\nEven the right to vote is in peril. The latest outrage is that the president has effectively eliminated the democratically elected opposition-led National Assembly by setting up an illegitimate alternative whose goal is to rewrite our Constitution, and which \n.\nThe Venezuela crisis won\xe2\x80\x99t stay within our borders. Internal displacement is at an all-time high as the regime refuses to allow humanitarian aid into the country. Last year tens of thousands of Venezuelans fled the country. And in the 2016 fiscal year, more Venezuelans applied for political asylum in the United States than any other nationality. To stem this forced migration, the international community should demand that Mr. Maduro allow a United Nations-led humanitarian program into our country.\nThe long-term solution to our woes is clear: We need the full restoration of our democracy. This includes the release of all political prisoners, respect for the democratically elected National Assembly, and general elections managed by a newly appointed, independent electoral commission. The international community can help by refusing any dialogue that gives leeway to the Maduro regime.\nDespite the suffering in Venezuela, the emotion I most associate with our people is hope. We believe that we will rescue our democracy, with the help of the international community. We know that our future is in our hands. Beyond just denouncing the current regime\xe2\x80\x99s crimes, we are preparing for a democratic transition. And we won\xe2\x80\x99t be stopped.\n'

aS'The global spread of democracy, a Western gift to the world, was meant to result in the election of liberal, pro-Western leaders. Instead, a wave of strongmen rulers has been elected, many of whom have clear non-Western identities. This list includes Shinzo Abe of Japan, Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey, Narendra Modi of India and, looking back further, Vladimir V. Putin of Russia. China\xe2\x80\x99s Xi Jinping can be added to this list, emerging as he did from a fiercely competitive political process within the 80 million-member Communist Party of China.\nThe rise of these leaders may reflect a new chapter in history. For the past 200 years, the West has been unusually powerful, dominating history even in the post-colonial era. However, mistakes made by the West have given rise to the sharp anti-Western edge of leaders like Mr. Erdogan and Mr. Putin. And as American and European power recedes, a global resurrection of non-Western attitudes is taking place.\nEurope humiliated Turkey for decades. Under Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, Turkey made the bold decision to leave the Islamic world and join the West. Turkey, a member of NATO, applied to join the predecessor to the European Union in 1987. The country was denied, while smaller nations like Slovakia, Latvia and Estonia were admitted. This rebuff undermined the political standing of the secular pro-Western Turks living in and around Istanbul.\nThe initial election of Mr. Erdogan in 2003 represented the Turkish people\xe2\x80\x99s strong desire for a leader who could stand up to Europe, and his rule was legitimized by solid economic growth. While Mr. Erdogan\xe2\x80\x99s popularity has recently slipped \xe2\x80\x94 he barely won the \n \xe2\x80\x94 he has never been more politically powerful. Mr. Erdogan has the ability to shape Turkey\xe2\x80\x99s future by moving it away from its secular past and making its Islamic identity more visible.\nRussia suffered even greater humiliation than Turkey. Mikhail Gorbachev\xe2\x80\x99s unilateral dissolution of the Soviet Union was an unimaginable geopolitical gift to the West, especially America. The Russia that remained was a shell of its former empire. Contrary to the implicit assurances given to Mr. Gorbachev and Soviet leaders, the West expanded NATO to include former member nations of the Warsaw Pact, embarrassing Russia as its geopolitical territory shrank.\nAfter Mr. Putin was elected in 2000, the West threatened to expand the Atlantic alliance into Ukraine. He was left with no choice but to \n, which had been part of Russia from 1783 to 1954. Even Mr. Gorbachev, a pro-Westerner, supported Mr. Putin, \n that the Crimean referendum showed that \xe2\x80\x9cpeople really wanted to return to Russia.\xe2\x80\x9d Given a choice, 95.5 percent of the voters elected to join Russia.\nMr. Putin\xe2\x80\x99s election reflected the will of the Russian people. They wanted a strongman who could stand up to the West. He did this by invading Crimea and supporting President Bashar al-Assad in Syria. There are no saints in geopolitical games; if the West had shown respect for Russia instead of humiliating it, Mr. Putin might not have come to power.\nNeither Japan nor India has been humiliated by the West in recent times. Indeed, both have drawn geopolitically closer to America since the rise of China. Yet even in these countries there is a clear desire to support strong leaders who can forcefully enhance the nation\xe2\x80\x99s identity.\nOutwardly, Mr. Abe appears to be a pro-Western leader, especially with his dapper Western suits. Inwardly, however, he is an ardent Japanese nationalist. His grandfather Nobusuke Kishi was accused as a \xe2\x80\x9cclass-A war criminal\xe2\x80\x9d after World War II. Mr. Abe believes he was unjustly accused. Mr. Abe has also allowed his fellow members of parliament to visit the controversial nationalist \n, drawing the ire of China and South Korea.\nOutwardly, Mr. Abe maintains deference to America. Inwardly, he is dying to break free from his geopolitical shackles. For example, even as America and Europe were trying hard to isolate Moscow, Mr. Abe worked behind the scenes in Moscow in April 2013 to try to reach a private deal with Mr. Putin on the disputed Kurile Islands, which Russia had taken over at the end of World War II.\nMr. Modi\xe2\x80\x99s forceful emergence on the world stage demonstrates that India is no longer a second-tier power. Mr. Modi has shed many of the pro-Western trappings that the Indian establishment was once so proud of. Despite a punishing schedule during his first official \n to the United States in September 2014, Mr. Modi fasted for nine days in observance of the Hindu festival of Navratri. Mr. Modi seldom wears Western clothes and speaks mostly in Hindi. His support of some loud right-wing voices, including the chief minister of Uttar Pradesh, \n, is worrying. But Mr. Modi is no demagogue. He is a pragmatic nationalist focused on economic growth. In Mr. Modi\xe2\x80\x99s mind, there is no doubt that we are moving toward a G-3 world, with India securing an equal place alongside America and China.\nWhile the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, functions in a very different political environment from that of Mr. Abe and Mr. Modi, culturally there is an affinity among the three leaders: Each is profoundly confident in his respective national identity. A hundred years ago, Indian, Japanese and Chinese leaders called upon their people to emulate the West to move ahead. Voices like Sun Yat-sen in China and Raja Ram Mohan Roy in India spoke of the need to mirror the West.\nToday, such a thought wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t even cross the minds of Mr. Abe, Mr. Modi and Mr. Xi. Instead, all three are telling their people to remember their own glorious histories.\nAs more and more countries shed their deference to the West, the continuing resurrection of strong nationalist leaders is inevitable. Our geopolitical future likely lies with this new wave.\n'

aS'For seven years, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t exist.\nWhile incarcerated, I had no bank statements, no bills, no credit history. In our interconnected world of big data, I appeared to be no different than a deceased person. After I was released, that lack of information about me created a host of problems, from difficulty accessing bank accounts to trouble getting a driver\xe2\x80\x99s license and renting an apartment.\nIn 2010, the iPhone was only three years old, and many people still didn\xe2\x80\x99t see smartphones as the indispensable digital appendages they are today. Seven years later, virtually everything we do causes us to bleed digital information, putting us at the mercy of invisible algorithms that threaten to consume our freedom.\nInformation leakage can seem innocuous in some respects. After all, why worry when we have nothing to hide?\nWe file our taxes. We make phone calls. We send emails. Tax records are used to keep us honest. We agree to broadcast our location so we can check the weather on our smartphones. Records of our calls, texts and physical movements are filed away alongside our billing information. Perhaps that data is analyzed more covertly to make sure that we\xe2\x80\x99re not terrorists \xe2\x80\x94 but only in the interest of national security, we\xe2\x80\x99re assured.\nOur faces and voices are recorded by surveillance cameras and other internet-connected sensors, some of which we now willingly put inside our homes. Every time we load a news article or page on a social media site, we expose ourselves to tracking code, allowing hundreds of unknown entities to monitor our shopping and online browsing habits. We agree to cryptic terms-of-service agreements that obscure the true nature and scope of these transactions.\nAccording to a 2015 \n from the Pew Research Center, 91 percent of American adults believe they\xe2\x80\x99ve lost control over how their personal information is collected and used.\nJust how much they\xe2\x80\x99ve lost, however, is more than they likely suspect.\nThe real power of mass data collection lies in the hand-tailored algorithms capable of sifting, sorting and identifying patterns within the data itself. When enough information is collected over time, governments and corporations can use or abuse those patterns to predict future human behavior. Our data establishes a \xe2\x80\x9c\n\xe2\x80\x9d from seemingly harmless digital residue like cellphone tower pings, credit card transactions and web browsing histories.\nThe consequences of our being subjected to constant algorithmic scrutiny are often unclear. For instance, \n \xe2\x80\x94 Silicon Valley\xe2\x80\x99s catchall term for deepthinking and deep-learning algorithms \xe2\x80\x94 is touted by tech companies as a path to the high-tech conveniences of the so-called internet of things. This includes digital home assistants, connected appliances and self-driving cars.\nSimultaneously, algorithms are already analyzing social media habits, determining creditworthiness, deciding which job candidates get called in for an interview and judging whether criminal defendants should be \n. Other machine-learning systems use automated facial analysis to detect and track emotions, or claim the ability to predict whether someone will become a criminal based only on their \n.\nThese systems leave no room for humanity, yet they define our daily lives. When I began rebuilding my life this summer, I painfully discovered that they have no time for people who have fallen off the grid \xe2\x80\x94 such nuance eludes them. I came out publicly as transgender and began hormone replacement therapy while in prison. When I was released, however, there was no quantifiable history of me existing as a transwoman. Credit and background checks automatically assumed I was committing fraud. My bank accounts were still under my old name, which legally no longer existed. For months I had to carry around a large folder containing my old ID and a copy of the court order declaring my name change. Even then, human clerks and bank tellers would sometimes see the discrepancy, shrug and say \xe2\x80\x9cthe computer says no\xe2\x80\x9d while denying me access to my accounts.\nSuch programmatic, machine-driven thinking has become especially dangerous in the hands of governments and the police.\nIn recent years our military, law enforcement and intelligence agencies have merged in unexpected ways. They harvest more data than they can possibly manage, and wade through the quantifiable world side by side in vast, usually windowless buildings called \n.\nSuch powerful new relationships have created a foundation for, and have breathed life into, a vast police and surveillance state. Advanced algorithms have made this possible on an unprecedented level. Relatively minor infractions, or \xe2\x80\x9cmicrocrimes,\xe2\x80\x9d can now be policed aggressively. And with national databases shared among governments and corporations, these minor incidents can follow you forever, even if the information is incorrect or lacking context.\nAt the same time, the United States military uses the metadata of countless communications for \n, using pings emitted from cellphones to track and eliminate targets.\nIn literature and pop culture, concepts such as \xe2\x80\x9cthoughtcrime\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cprecrime\xe2\x80\x9d have emerged out of dystopian fiction. They are used to restrict and punish anyone who is flagged by automated systems as a potential criminal or threat, even if a crime has yet to be committed. But this science fiction trope is quickly becoming reality. Predictive policing algorithms are already being used to create automated heat maps of future crimes, and like the \xe2\x80\x9cmanual\xe2\x80\x9d policing that came before them, they overwhelmingly \n.\nThe world has become like an eerily banal dystopian novel. Things look the same on the surface, but they are not. With no apparent boundaries on how algorithms can use and abuse the data that\xe2\x80\x99s being collected about us, the potential for it to control our lives is ever-growing.\nOur drivers\xe2\x80\x99 licenses, our keys, our debit and credit cards are all important parts of our lives. Even our social media accounts could soon become crucial components of being fully functional members of society. Now that we live in this world, we must figure out how to maintain our connection with society without surrendering to automated processes that we can neither see nor control.\n'

aS'TOKYO \xe2\x80\x94 Pyongyang\xe2\x80\x99s recent missile launch over \n and its underground \n have laid bare Japan\xe2\x80\x99s Achilles\xe2\x80\x99 heel: Our country\xe2\x80\x99s national security policy is still woefully ill equipped for this mounting danger. The \n adopted by the United Nations Security Council on Monday will hardly limit Japan\xe2\x80\x99s exposure.\nNorth Korea\xe2\x80\x99s latest provocations pose an unprecedented threat. Even during the Korean War in the early 1950s, Japan, as a rear support base for United States forces, was somewhat insulated; today, it is in the same theater as South Korea, also on the front lines. Any American military strike against North Korea would likely trigger retaliatory measures against Japan.\nJapan is in a terrible predicament: Highly exposed but with very few options, military or diplomatic, to help itself.\nIts defense ministry plans to \n, to eight, the number of ships equipped with the Aegis missile-defense system. But the new fleet won\xe2\x80\x99t be operational before \n. Even if Japan also acquires the land-based Aegis Ashore system, as it is contemplating doing, none of this additional capacity could offer it enough protection against North Korea\xe2\x80\x99s increasingly lethal missiles \xe2\x80\x94 much less deter North Korea from further developing its own arsenal.\nThis is one reason Itsunori Onodera, the new defense minister, has been making a case for developing Japan\xe2\x80\x99s \n, so that it could strike military bases in North Korea, perhaps even preemptively. But such a move faces numerous obstacles \xe2\x80\x94 financial, tactical and strategic.\nNo budget decision for such capabilities is expected to even be made until at least \n. Acquiring offensive weaponry would require redefining the terms of Japan\xe2\x80\x99s existing security agreement with the United States, which relegates Japan to a purely defensive role and places all responsibility for any offensive action solely with America.\nIn the face of these constraints, some \n and \n in Washington are arguing that Japan, as well as South Korea, might, and perhaps \n, consider acquiring nuclear weapons themselves.\nThe idea is a nonstarter. According to \n conducted in June and July, only 9 percent of Japanese respondents think Japan should acquire nuclear weapons. (About 67 percent of South Koreans polled said that South Korea should get such weapons.) The nuclearization of Japan \xe2\x80\x94 or South Korea \xe2\x80\x94 would undermine nonproliferation efforts, as well as validate North Korea\xe2\x80\x99s nuclear brinkmanship to date.\nGiven the difficulties of developing an independent military capability, Tokyo has no choice but to pursue a diplomatic solution with the help of other states \xe2\x80\x94 even though several multilateral efforts have failed in the past and bilateral relations between some of the main players today arguably are more fraught than ever.\nTensions are mounting between the United States and China, for example, over dominance in the South China Sea. South Korea\xe2\x80\x99s decision to deploy the missile-defense system known as Thaad to protect itself from North Korea has \n Beijing, which says the system is in fact designed to track missiles from China.\nRelations between Tokyo and Seoul have long been uneasy, largely because of unresolved issues from Japan\xe2\x80\x99s occupation of the Korean Peninsula in the 1930s and 1940s, including about so-called comfort women, Korean women who were coerced or compelled into having sex with Japanese soldiers. And the new South Korean president, Moon Jae-in, appears to be taking a firmer stand on that question than his predecessor, who signed an agreement with Japan in 2015 hoping to finally settle the matter. It is now very difficult to imagine, for example, that Japan\xe2\x80\x99s Self-Defense Forces could ever \n, even to assist with, say, an evacuation after an attack by North Korea.\nAt the same time, however, as the threat from Pyongyang becomes more ominous, the pressing need for an effective response may suggest, even create, new diplomatic opportunities.\nPrime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan and President Trump seem to have quickly developed an intimate working relationship, and that \xe2\x80\x94 along with South Korea\xe2\x80\x99s moves to strengthen its security ties with the United States \xe2\x80\x94 may allow for more effective cooperation among the three countries, despite difficulties between Japan and South Korea. This trilateralism, in turn, could form the basis for five-party talks including China and Russia, and eventually lead to the resumption of negotiations with Pyongyang as well.\nThe U.N. Security Council\xe2\x80\x99s decision to cap North Korea\xe2\x80\x99s oil imports, though a watered-down version of the penalties sought by the United States government, was significant nonetheless. For one thing, it was a reminder that coordinated action with China and Russia, which have been wary of imposing more sanctions against Pyongyang, is possible.\nOn this front, too, North Korea\xe2\x80\x99s recent brinkmanship may have unexpectedly paved the way for new (if slim) possibilities for cooperation. Mr. Abe and President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia seem to have developed an effective line of communication, including on intractable-seeming issues, like the status of \n in the Pacific. And the chances for at least some measure of rapprochement between Japan and China may be growing. Building bridges with Beijing remains a loaded notion for many Japanese people, but Mr. Abe now has more clout and political capital to try, in the name of protecting Japan against the more immediate threat posed by North Korea.\nThe recent escalation of the North Korea crisis seems to have validated Mr. Abe\xe2\x80\x99s controversial efforts to strengthen Japan\xe2\x80\x99s defense posture. The Japanese public is now \n to adopting a tougher stance. The new leader of the opposition Democratic Party, Seiji Maehara, is a hawk, and under his leadership the party, traditionally an advocate of pacifism, is likely to support, if perhaps reluctantly, the Abe administration\xe2\x80\x99s hard-nosed approach to security.\nThere is no viable military solution to the North Korea crisis. Japan, like the other main parties, must make the most of the slivers of opportunity created by the escalating threat to renew efforts at finding a multilateral diplomatic solution.\n'

aS'WASHINGTON \xe2\x80\x94 Secretary of State \n last month that United States policy toward Iran shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t begin and end with the nuclear deal. Washington\xe2\x80\x99s issues with that country are far wider, Mr. Tillerson said, citing Iran\xe2\x80\x99s meddling in Syria and Iraq, and its support for terrorist groups like Hezbollah.\nThe secretary of state is certainly right about that. But he elided an important point: Without a stable approach to the nuclear deal, questions about its fate will distract from and ultimately hobble broader American diplomacy on Iran and other crucial issues in the Middle East.\nPresident Trump \xe2\x80\x94 who campaigned on promises to tear up the nuclear deal \xe2\x80\x94 has indicated that in mid-October, when the next 90-day deadline for recertifying Iran\xe2\x80\x99s compliance with the agreement arrives, he will find that Iran has violated it. This could lead to the deal\xe2\x80\x99s collapse.\nBut there seems to be \n in any significant way. The Iranians appear to be exploiting \n and trying to get away with what they can when it comes to the deal\xe2\x80\x99s limits on certain nuclear activities like the production and storage of heavy water. Likewise, they seem to be \n levied by the United Nations but not actually included in the nuclear agreement itself.\nNone of these appear to constitute a material breach of the agreement. The problem the United States faces is not Iranian compliance, but the very terms of the agreement. Mr. Trump isn\xe2\x80\x99t wrong when he says it\xe2\x80\x99s a \xe2\x80\x9cbad deal.\xe2\x80\x9d It\xe2\x80\x99s too narrow in scope, permitting Iran to work on its missile and centrifuge technology even while uranium enrichment is paused. More worrying, it\xe2\x80\x99s only temporary. Some of its strictures begin to phase out in less than a decade, during which time Tehran can expand its power in the Middle East, just as the United States\xe2\x80\x99 tools for trying to keep it in check \xe2\x80\x94 in particular, sanctions \xe2\x80\x94 are limited.\nBut like it or not, the clock is not so easily turned back. Any realistic Iran policy must take this as its starting point. Rather than ripping up the deal or simply acquiescing to it, the Trump administration should strengthen both the deal and the policy framework of which it is a part. Stability on the issue of the nuclear agreement will eliminate a distraction and create leverage to rally international support for a better Middle East strategy.\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s why the United States should work with allies to more strictly interpret the existing text of the accord. Along with Britain, France and Germany \xe2\x80\x94 sometimes known as the E.U.3 \xe2\x80\x94 the United States should close any loopholes being exploited by Iran, increase intelligence cooperation on Iran\xe2\x80\x99s nuclear activities and push international inspectors to interpret their mandate more broadly. These allies should also agree to enforce United Nations rules that aren\xe2\x80\x99t included in the agreement, like those strictly limiting Iran\xe2\x80\x99s arms trade.\nWorking with these same allies, the United States should also tackle issues omitted from the nuclear deal, like Iran\xe2\x80\x99s missile program. Through a package of sanctions, export controls, interdictions and missile defense, they should aim to prevent Iran from acquiring an intercontinental ballistic missile and from continuing to export missile technology.\nThe United States and the E.U.3 should also address the problem of the nuclear deal\xe2\x80\x99s expiration date by jointly declaring now that they intend to expand and extend the agreement, rather than allow Iran\xe2\x80\x99s nuclear activities to suddenly increase when it expires. In parallel, they should seek to strengthen global nonproliferation efforts so that even if nuclear restrictions specific to Iran cannot be extended, Tehran faces more challenges to weaponization when the deal does lapse.\nAll of this must go hand in hand with a larger strategy to counter Iranian aggression in the Middle East. Iran\xe2\x80\x99s leaders appear to be increasingly self-confident, perceiving success in \n, \n and \n. And Iran is steadily expanding its network of \n. To reverse these trends, the United States must move from generalities about countering Iran to specific aims \xe2\x80\x94 for example, preventing Iranian forces from entrenching in \n, or deterring the use of anti-ship cruise missiles in the Bab el Mandeb Strait off Yemen\xe2\x80\x99s coast. American officials need to communicate these boundaries to Iran and back them up with a range of tools, including sanctions, diplomacy and limited military force if necessary.\nThese measures require help from America\xe2\x80\x99s allies, who are not eager to fiddle with the nuclear agreement or face up to the problem of Iran\xe2\x80\x99s regional policies. This is where diplomacy comes in. Allies in Europe and elsewhere know the deal is controversial in Washington, and they take seriously Mr. Trump\xe2\x80\x99s threats to stop honoring it. Policy makers in Washington should make clear that their allies\xe2\x80\x99 cooperation with efforts to strengthen the deal and counter Iran are required to avoid that outcome. The United States cannot subordinate its entire policy toward Iran or the Middle East to the preservation of the nuclear accord. And it shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t shoulder sole responsibility for addressing Iran\xe2\x80\x99s threats while Europe enjoys the deal\xe2\x80\x99s benefits.\nEven then, this would constitute only the start of a policy for addressing the challenge of Iran. Iran is adept at exploiting chaos, which is endemic in the Middle East. Washington will need sound approaches to the wars in Syria and Yemen, Iraq\xe2\x80\x99s fragility and other regional challenges like the \n. But none of this will be possible if there is an international crisis every time there\xe2\x80\x99s a new deadline for certifying compliance or waiving sanctions.\n'

aS'BANGALORE, India \xe2\x80\x94 On the evening of Sept. 5, I got a call from my wife, a fellow journalist. \xe2\x80\x9cGauri Lankesh has been shot outside her house,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cShe is dead.\xe2\x80\x9d Ms. Lankesh, 55, was the editor of \n, a weekly newspaper, which she published from Bangalore, India, in the southern state of Karnataka.\nI drove with two journalist friends to the morgue of a hospital where her body was. At 8 p.m., she had been entering her home in the upper-class area of Bangalore when an assassin on a motorbike fired at her and fled. \n, damaging her heart and lungs, according to the post-mortem report.\nI had known her for 10 years. All I ever did was argue with her. Our arguments had acquired an increasing intensity in the three years since Narendra Modi came to power and India turned toward majoritarianism and intolerance. An outspoken critic of Prime Minister Modi\xe2\x80\x99s Hindu nationalist government, she said in her last editorial that spreading fake news had contributed to the success of Mr. Modi and his party.\nAfter \n, a Dalit graduate student and activist at a university in the southern city of Hyderabad, killed himself in January 2016 because of intense, unceasing institutionalized caste discrimination, a \n of Dalit (lowest caste) and leftist student groups sought the prosecution of university officials and the right-wing Bharatiya Janata Party politicians, who had pushed him to the brink. The leftist groups dominated by upper-caste Hindus were not willing to work under the leadership of Dalit activists.\nI was agitatedly talking to Ms. Lankesh about how the Indian left was almost entirely led by upper-caste Hindus. Ten years of reporting on caste prejudice and politics and my personal history of growing up and working as a Dalit writer made me believe that even in struggles for civil and political rights, the Indian left excluded the Dalits from positions of leadership. Ms. Lankesh didn\xe2\x80\x99t see leadership as a big question when in the context of the more pressing need to fight the rise of Hindu nationalism, which she described as \xe2\x80\x9cfascism.\xe2\x80\x9d\nShe mockingly asked me, \xe2\x80\x9cAnd where are the Dalit women leaders?\xe2\x80\x9d\nI replied sarcastically, mentioning something about privilege.\nShe was enraged. \xe2\x80\x9cYes, I am rich, I live in a big house and I am very privileged,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cCome up with a better argument for why, as a woman, I should not be part of the anti-caste struggle. Go read Ambedkar properly!\xe2\x80\x9d\nThe conversation ended and I thought we would never speak again.\nI met her a little later at a lecture in Bangalore. She held my hand for a long while after the talk and introduced me to everyone as her son. A few days later, she messaged me with kind words about an article I had written. And she wanted to watch \xe2\x80\x9cMadras,\xe2\x80\x9d a movie by Pa Ranjith, a young Dalit filmmaker.\nMs. Lankesh was also an effective political organizer with the ability to bring together social and political groups \xe2\x80\x94 Dalits, indigenous tribals, leftists, Muslims and others \xe2\x80\x94 opposed to the Hindu nationalist attempts to transform India into a country primarily for the Hindus.\nThe priests at a temple in Udupi, a southern Indian town \xe2\x80\x94 a stronghold of the Hindu nationalist movement \xe2\x80\x94 were segregating the lower castes, especially Dalit devotees, from the upper-caste Hindus. Last September, Ms. Lankesh helped persuade numerous progressive, Dalit and leftist groups, and nongovernmental organizations \xe2\x80\x94 who loathe working together because of political differences \xe2\x80\x94 to come together in a march to protest segregation at the Udupi temple. The question of whether Dalits will get to lead the struggle for their rights returned. Ms. Lankesh negotiated with every group to ensure that the upper-caste leaders didn\xe2\x80\x99t appropriate the march.\nA month earlier, in July 2016, hard-line Hindu activists had stripped and \n four Dalit men in Gujarat, the home state of Mr. Modi, for skinning a cow. Thousands of Dalits earn their meager livelihood from skinning dead cows and buffaloes and selling their hides to leather traders. Jignesh Mevani, a young Dalit lawyer, organized and led huge protests in Gujarat against the cow vigilantes.\nMs. Lankesh settled the question of leadership by getting everybody to agree that Mr. Mevani should lead the march against \n to Udupi temple. Around 10,000 people joined the march. The opposition unity made an impression.\nSoon after that I saw my social media timelines filled with photographs of Ms. Lankesh hugging \n, leftist student leaders from a university in New Delhi. She called them \xe2\x80\x9cher children.\xe2\x80\x9d It was her way of creating unity among various groups opposed to the rise of the majoritarian politics.\nOn the night of her murder, I stood outside her house with our common friends and we wondered why anyone would kill her. She wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the only outspoken critic of the Hindu right. Her newspaper, which was critical of Mr. Modi\xe2\x80\x99s government and the Hindu nationalists, didn\xe2\x80\x99t sell more than a few thousand copies although it was much respected.\nI wondered if they killed her because she was a member of the \n community in Karnataka, which wants to separate from Brahmanical Hinduism. In the past few months, the Lingayat leaders had mobilized hundreds of thousands of supporters in public rallies. The mobilization threatens the chances of the Hindu nationalist B.J.P. in the forthcoming state elections in Karnataka. Although Ms. Lankesh supported the call, the Lingayat movement had other, enormously powerful leaders.\nIn August 2013, the activist \n, who campaigned against religious superstitions, was murdered. In August 2015, \n, a scholar and outspoken critic of idol worship among Hindus, was gunned down at his own doorstep. In February 2015, \n, a Communist leader, community organizer and columnist, was killed in a small town near Mumbai.\nMr. Dhabolkar, Mr. Kalburgi and Mr. Pansare were murdered by assassins on motorbikes, who hid their faces with helmets and fled after the murder. Exactly as Ms. Lankesh was killed.\nThe murdered intellectuals also wrote in regional languages and worked as activists. Each of them shared the quality of being acceptable to the leftist groups and Dalit groups. They could bring together communities opposed to the Hindu right.\nWe don\xe2\x80\x99t know yet who killed Ms. Lankesh, but various supporters of Mr. Modi, the B.J.P. and its parent organization, the Hindu nationalist mother ship, Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, \n on social media.\n'

aS'Yet another woman is attacked and killed in an isolated place outside her village in Darfur. The story line is terribly familiar, not only from 2003 when the genocide began in Sudan, but to this day. Beyond the village, who notices now? Where is it reported as news? How will justice come if it is not reported, if no one cares?\nI care. The woman who was attacked and killed on Aug. 21, 2017, was my sister, Noi.\nI care. I am angry. I cry out for justice for Noi.\nI am the youngest of seven children, five of whom survived, until now. Our two brothers and our other sister moved away from our village, Muzbat, in North Darfur. Noi stayed behind. She was the second youngest, but to me, she was my big sister. She helped look after me when I was a child. She was kind, strong and brave, capable and independent.\nAfter the first wave of attacks by Sudanese government forces in Darfur in 2003, I became an interpreter and guide there for aid organizations and Western journalists. In 2006, I was captured, imprisoned and tortured by the government of Sudan. With help from the United States, I was released from prison and came to America as a refugee in March 2007.\nMuzbat is one of the thousands of villages destroyed by Sudan\xe2\x80\x99s army and militias in the Darfur genocide since 2003. We are from the Zaghawa tribe, one of the three tribes targeted by the government. Muzbat was \n repeatedly. The people would flee, return and rebuild.\nLiving in Muzbat, Noi married and raised her children. She was the one who took care of the family. After our father died in 2006, Noi looked after our elderly mother, now nearly blind and deaf. Noi had five children. The two oldest girls are grown and married. The two younger girls, Alia and Henneni, still lived with Noi, along with her youngest, a boy, Ali, who is 14.\nDespite hardships, Noi thrived. She owned seven cows, 15 sheep, more than 25 goats and a donkey. Some years ago, I was able to sneak back into Darfur for a visit. In August 2014, I got married in Muzbat, in my sister\xe2\x80\x99s house. I last visited Noi in June last year.\nMore recently, Noi and I had been in touch via telephone. This required complicated prearrangement through family members in El Fasher, the capital city of North Darfur. They would coordinate a time for Noi to use my prepaid phone card from a telephone in the Muzbat market. Noi and I had fixed a time for a phone call on Tuesday, Aug. 22, but she was killed the day before our appointment.\nThe Sudanese government\xe2\x80\x99s infamous and deadly Janjaweed militia, which has preyed on Darfuris since 2003, has formally become part of the National Intelligence and Security Service, and is named the Rapid Support Forces. In recent months, an R.S.F. base with about 150 vehicles was established near Muzbat.\nIt is the rainy season in Muzbat. There is grass for grazing, but it is a long walk from Muzbat. On Monday morning, Aug. 21, Noi rode her donkey and led her seven cows out to pasture. Later in the day, the donkey made its own way back to Muzbat \xe2\x80\x94 to the consternation of the villagers. The next day, a small group men and women followed the donkey\xe2\x80\x99s tracks.\nFour hours later, they found Noi\xe2\x80\x99s body. She had been shot in the head. There was blood on the ground and tracks from her attacker. The women brought Noi\xe2\x80\x99s body back to Muzbat. The men followed the tracks to the R.S.F. camp, where the base commander came out to meet them. He refused to allow them into the camp, but told them he was holding the militia man who had confessed to killing Noi. The R.S.F. commander sent the villagers home.\nThe villagers learned that the suspected killer was an R.S.F. soldier, who had an injury to his head. He had wiped the blood from his gun and clothes but had taken Noi\xe2\x80\x99s shoes. He had left the R.S.F. camp with his rifle. He saw Noi and followed her for hours to an isolated place, where he attacked her. He had tried to rape her, but Noi fought back, wounding him in the head before he shot and killed her.\nBack at Muzbat, the villagers raised the alarm and sought help from surrounding villages. The next day, hundreds of villagers from the area went to the R.S.F. base to demand justice for Noi. With tension rising, the R.S.F. sent the suspect to El Fasher under arrest.\nIt is very unusual in such cases that a killer is ever found. Even more unusual that one should be arrested.\nPerhaps the R.S.F. commander thought he had to act because the evidence was undeniable and he was confronted with the angry villagers. Yet there have been no news reports, either about the attack and killing of Noi, or concerning the arrest of her suspected killer. In fact, two government officials later visited the village, found and deleted pictures of Noi\xe2\x80\x99s body on villagers\xe2\x80\x99 cellphones, and warned the inhabitants not to speak to the media.\nWe, Noi\xe2\x80\x99s family, are not surprised that the government is taking steps to hide its crimes. We fear that the killer will not see justice.\nIncredibly, the same R.S.F. that attacks villages in Darfur and is responsible for killings and rapes is being paid by the European Union to help stem the flow of refugees who might find their way to Europe. An \n earlier this year found that European Union funding for the Sudanese effort to curb migration already amounted to nearly 215 million euros. Another \n called this European support for the R.S.F. a case of \xe2\x80\x9cBorder Control From Hell.\xe2\x80\x9d\nI can testify that this rebranded Janjaweed militia is not a source of stability, but an agent of death and destruction. It is a scandal that the R.S.F. is, in effect, funded by the European Union.\nI tell Noi\xe2\x80\x99s story in the hope that some publicity about her murder will help to ensure that her killer will not escape justice. I hope, too, that the European Union and the United States, which is expected to decide next month on whether to lift sanctions on Sudan, will see the R.S.F. and the government in Khartoum for what they are. I dream of the day that peace and justice come to Darfur, for Noi\xe2\x80\x99s sake and for all Darfuris.\n'

aS'After the white-nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Va., last month where a man drove a car into a crowd, killing a counter-demonstrator, the American neo-Nazi website The Daily Stormer published a long, hate-riddled post mocking the victim.\nOutcry over the article led its domain registrar, GoDaddy, \n. The site then registered with Google, which also quickly canceled its hosting. But it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t until Cloudflare, a website security and performance service, dropped the site as a client that The Daily Stormer truly lost its ability to stay online.\nBecause of the precise nature of Cloudflare\xe2\x80\x99s business, and the scarcity of competitors, its role censoring internet speech is not just new, it\xe2\x80\x99s \nWhat makes Cloudflare an essential part of the internet is \n from barraging clients\xe2\x80\x99 websites with requests that take them offline. Cloudflare is one of the few companies in the world that provide this kind of reliable protection. If you don\xe2\x80\x99t want your website to get taken down by extortionists, jokers, political opposition or hackers, you have to hire Cloudflare or one of its very few competitors.\nGenerally speaking, there are two kinds of corporate players on the internet: companies that build infrastructure through which content flows, and companies that seek to curate content and create a community.\nInternet service providers like Verizon and Comcast, domain name servers, web hosts and security services providers like Cloudflare are all the former \xe2\x80\x94 or the \xe2\x80\x9cpipe.\xe2\x80\x9d They typically don\xe2\x80\x99t look at the content their clients and customers are putting up, they just give them the means to do it and let it flow. Social media platforms like Facebook are the latter. They encourage their users to create, share and engage with content \xe2\x80\x94 so they look at content all the time and decide whether they want to allow hateful material like that of neo-Nazis to stay up.\nWhile there have long been worries about internet service providers favoring access to some content over others, there has been less concern about companies further along the pipeline holding an internet on/off switch. In large part, this is because at other points in the pipeline, users have choice. Private companies can make their own rules, and consumers can choose among them. If GoDaddy won\xe2\x80\x99t register your domain, you can go to Bluehost or thousands of other companies.\nBut the fewer choices you have for the infrastructure you need to stay online, the more serious the consequences when companies refuse service. This is why Cloudflare\xe2\x80\x99s decision to drop The Daily Stormer is so significant. Denying security service to one Nazi website seems fine now, but what if Cloudflare started suspending service for a political candidate that its chief executive didn\xe2\x80\x99t like?\nWith this move, Cloudflare is wading into the business of evaluating the content of its clients \xe2\x80\x94 something sites like Facebook and Twitter have been wrestling with for years, leading them to develop complex rules and procedures that govern what users are and are not allowed to post. Most agree that it\xe2\x80\x99s appropriate for social media companies to take down certain kinds of content \xe2\x80\x94 that\xe2\x80\x99s how they ensure our newsfeeds aren\xe2\x80\x99t full of pornography or violence. But that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean we don\xe2\x80\x99t want that type of content to be able to exist \n on the internet. Ensuring that sites like Cloudflare remain content-neutral might be necessary to guarantee that.\nOne of the additional difficulties with Cloudflare is that it is not so much a piece of pipe as it is a service. Specifically, it is a paid-for-protection service. Having to hire Cloudflare to protect your website is like having to hire security to protect you from attackers when you speak in the public square. If that security service is the only one in town, and you\xe2\x80\x99ll be silenced if you try to speak without it, maybe that security service shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t pick and choose whom it protects. While regulation should not be done lightly or broadly, there\xe2\x80\x99s a case to be made that we should treat Cloudflare more like the police, who are supposed to equally protect all members of the public.\nLast week, Matthew Prince, Cloudflare\xe2\x80\x99s chief executive, acknowledged how much power his company has, and what\xe2\x80\x99s at stake. \xe2\x80\x9cThe internet is a really important resource for everyone,\xe2\x80\x9d he said in an interview with \n, \xe2\x80\x9cbut there\xe2\x80\x99s a very limited set of companies that control it and there\xe2\x80\x99s such little accountability to us that it really is quite a dangerous thing.\xe2\x80\x9d\nThis is the most terrifying realization surrounding Cloudflare\xe2\x80\x99s removal of a site from the internet: There\xe2\x80\x99s a lack of accountability present at every part of the pipeline and on platforms. The people who run these companies are not elected officials, yet we still expect them to safeguard our basic liberties while also meeting our cultural expectations. For the most part they do: both because it\xe2\x80\x99s good business to meet the expectations of their users, and because most have praiseworthy goals of corporate responsibility. Beyond these minor checks on these companies\xe2\x80\x99 power, we as users have no way to ensure they meet our needs \xe2\x80\x94 and we have no idea what site they\xe2\x80\x99ll take down next.\n'

aS'This is a pivotal moment in American history. Do we, as a nation, join the rest of the industrialized world and guarantee comprehensive health care to every person as a human right? Or do we maintain a system that is enormously expensive, wasteful and bureaucratic, and is designed to maximize profits for big insurance companies, the pharmaceutical industry, Wall Street and medical equipment suppliers?\nWe remain the only major country on earth that allows chief executives and stockholders in the health care industry to get incredibly rich, while tens of millions of people suffer because they can\xe2\x80\x99t get the health care they need. This is not what the United States should be about.\nAll over this country, I have heard from Americans who have shared heartbreaking stories about our dysfunctional system. Doctors have told me about patients who died because they put off their medical visits until it was too late. These were people who had no insurance or could not afford out-of-pocket costs imposed by their insurance plans.\nI have heard from older people who have been forced to split their pills in half because they couldn\xe2\x80\x99t pay the outrageously high price of prescription drugs. Oncologists have told me about cancer patients who have been unable to acquire lifesaving treatments because they could not afford them. This should not be happening in the world\xe2\x80\x99s wealthiest country.\nAmericans should not hesitate about going to the doctor because they do not have enough money. They should not worry that a hospital stay will bankrupt them or leave them deeply in debt. They should be able to go to the doctor they want, not just one in a particular network. They should not have to spend huge amounts of time filling out complicated forms and arguing with insurance companies as to whether or not they have the coverage they expected.\nEven though 28 million Americans remain uninsured and even more are underinsured, we spend far more per capita on health care than any other industrialized nation. In 2015, the United States spent almost $10,000 per person for health care; the Canadians, Germans, French and British spent less than half of that, while guaranteeing health care to everyone. Further, these countries have higher life expectancy rates and lower infant mortality rates than we do.\nThe reason that our health care system is so outrageously expensive is that it is not designed to provide quality care to all in a cost-effective way, but to provide huge profits to the medical-industrial complex. Layers of bureaucracy associated with the administration of hundreds of individual and complicated insurance plans is stunningly wasteful, costing us hundreds of billions of dollars a year. As the only major country not to negotiate drug prices with the pharmaceutical industry, we spend tens of billions more than we should.\nThe solution to this crisis is not hard to understand. A half-century ago, the United States established Medicare. Guaranteeing comprehensive health benefits to Americans over 65 has proved to be enormously successful, cost-effective and popular. Now is the time to expand and improve Medicare to cover all Americans.\nThis is not a radical idea. I live 50 miles south of the Canadian border. For decades, every man, woman and child in Canada has been guaranteed health care through a single-payer, publicly funded health care program. This system has not only improved the lives of the Canadian people but has also saved families and businesses an immense amount of money.\nOn Wednesday I will introduce the Medicare for All Act in the Senate with 15 co-sponsors and support from dozens of grass-roots organizations. Under this legislation, every family in America would receive comprehensive coverage, and middle-class families would save thousands of dollars a year by eliminating their private insurance costs as we move to a publicly funded program.\nThe transition to the Medicare for All program would take place over four years. In the first year, benefits to older people would be expanded to include dental care, vision coverage and hearing aids, and the eligibility age for Medicare would be lowered to 55. All children under the age of 18 would also be covered. In the second year, the eligibility age would be lowered to 45 and in the third year to 35. By the fourth year, every man, woman and child in the country would be covered by Medicare for All.\nNeedless to say, there will be huge opposition to this legislation from the powerful special interests that profit from the current wasteful system. The insurance companies, the drug companies and Wall Street will undoubtedly devote a lot of money to lobbying, campaign contributions and television ads to defeat this proposal. But they are on the wrong side of history.\nGuaranteeing health care as a right is important to the American people not just from a moral and financial perspective; it also happens to be what the majority of the American people want. According to an \n by The Economist/YouGov, 60 percent of the American people want to \xe2\x80\x9cexpand Medicare to provide health insurance to every American,\xe2\x80\x9d including 75 percent of Democrats, 58 percent of independents and 46 percent of Republicans.\nNow is the time for Congress to stand with the American people and take on the special interests that dominate health care in the United States. Now is the time to extend Medicare to everyone.\n'

aS'\xe2\x80\x9cControversies over freedom of speech on college campuses have existed as long as there have been college campuses. But the specific issues vary with each generation.\xe2\x80\x9d\nThat is the first line of Erwin Chemerinsky\xe2\x80\x99s new book, \xe2\x80\x9cFree Speech on Campus,\xe2\x80\x9d written with Howard Gillman. Mr. Chemerinsky is not only one of the foremost legal scholars on the First Amendment but also a firsthand witness to the free speech debates of today as the new dean of the University of California Berkeley School of Law.\nHere he talks with Natalie Shutler, the editor of the \n column, about hate speech, censorship and what campuses can and can\xe2\x80\x99t do. This interview has been edited and condensed.\n Hi, Professor! I have spent the past year talking with college students about free speech and, as you know all too well, it\xe2\x80\x99s a contentious topic for them. In this loud internet age, in which provocative opinions are hitting us constantly and from all sides, plenty of students don\xe2\x80\x99t see value in hosting more of the same on their campuses. One thing I appreciate about your new book is that you are thoughtful about these students\xe2\x80\x99 concerns, even if you disagree with their conclusions.\n I think we have to be attentive to the fact that many students want to restrict speech because of very laudable instincts. They want to protect other students from hate speech. They want to create an inclusive community for all. But the response to hate speech can\xe2\x80\x99t be to prohibit and punish it. It\xe2\x80\x99s unconstitutional. We have to find other ways to create inclusive communities.\n For many students, it\xe2\x80\x99s not just about hate speech, but the kind of speech that creates harm. This term is agonizingly broad and open to wildly different interpretations. But students aren\xe2\x80\x99t wrong in thinking that speech can be a weapon.\n Students are quite right. We protect speech \n of its effects. If speech had no effects, it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be a fundamental right. Those effects can be positive but they can also be very negative. Speech can cause enormous harm. It can be hurtful, it can cause people to be excluded, and it can interfere with education or employment. Especially in colleges and universities, we have to be attentive to that.\n But you do take a hard line in your book that even hate speech must be protected.\n The law under the First Amendment is clear: Hate speech is protected speech. Over 300 colleges and universities adopted hate speech codes in the early 1990s. Every one to be challenged in court was ruled unconstitutional. And there are good reasons for that.\nAfter some really ugly incidents at the University of Michigan in the late 1980s, the school adopted a hate speech code that was undoubtedly well intentioned. But a federal court declared it unconstitutional, in part, because it was so vague. It said that there could not be speech that \xe2\x80\x9cdemeans or stigmatizes\xe2\x80\x9d anyone based on race or gender. But what does that mean? A sociobiology student who challenged the law said, \xe2\x80\x9cI want to study whether there are inherent differences between women and men. What if my conclusions are deemed stigmatizing on the basis of gender?\xe2\x80\x9d And during the years Michigan\xe2\x80\x99s speech code was on the books, more than 20 black students were charged with racist speech by white students. There wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a single instance of a white student being punished for racist speech, even though that was what had prompted the drafting of the Michigan speech code in the first place.\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s part of a much bigger historical pattern: As we saw in Michigan, when hate speech codes or laws are adopted, they are most often directed at the very groups they are meant to protect.\n You make the distinction in your new book that this doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean that the First Amendment is absolute. For example, there is no constitutional protection for a \n or for harassment. Campuses can protect students against that kind of speech. But before you address unprotected speech, maybe we should talk a bit about the history of free speech, which you lay out in your book.\n It is hard to imagine social progress anywhere that wasn\xe2\x80\x99t dependent on freedom of speech. The civil rights protests of the 1960s \xe2\x80\x94 the lunch counter sit-ins, the marches and demonstrations \xe2\x80\x94 were essential to federal civil rights acts and the end of Jim Crow laws that segregated every aspect of the South. The anti-Vietnam War protests were crucial for the end of that war. This has been true throughout American history. The 19th Amendment that gave women the right to vote was the product of demonstrations and speech.\n Now, as you point out, many students associate free speech with the vitriol of the internet more than they do with the civil rights movement. I feel for them. The internet is terrible. But how do you see things turning around? How do you think students could begin to associate free speech as something for the vulnerable?\n Some of this is about a lack of education about the history of freedom of speech. I do worry that students today may equate free speech more with cruel or racist posts on Yik Yak than with the civil rights protests of the 1960s. But even when students talk about harm and safety, they need to remember how malleable those terms are. There is no doubt that the civil rights protests deeply offended many Southerners, however objectionable that may sound to us today. An example like that illustrates why offensiveness to an audience can\xe2\x80\x99t justify stopping speech.\n Identity is important to nearly every college student I talk to, regardless of their background or political persuasion. You make the case that free speech is the basis for asserting identities and, in particular, was necessary for the expansion in public of countercultural identities \xe2\x80\x94 including, and I\xe2\x80\x99m reading straight from the book here, \xe2\x80\x9cforms of expression that challenge traditional religion, prevailing social mores, familiar lifestyle choices, inherited views about sexuality, or historic gender roles.\xe2\x80\x9d But of course, some identities are much more vulnerable to intimidation than others.\nYou argue that college administrations need not ignore that. An administration can\xe2\x80\x99t bar a campus speaker, but it can engage in its own speech by reaffirming the social standards of the community and reaching out to students who might be offended or hurt. Campuses don\xe2\x80\x99t need to stand behind offensive speakers; they just need to allow them the opportunity to speak.\n I think it\xe2\x80\x99s so important for campus officials to respond to and condemn hate speech. Just because the First Amendment protects a right to say something, that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean it \n be said.\nCampus officials can describe the type of community they want to create and denounce hate speech as inconsistent with it. Many years ago, when I was teaching at the University of Southern California Law School, someone wrote a very offensive homophobic slur on a chalkboard. The dean did not try to find out who did it or threaten punishment. Instead, he wrote a very powerful statement about why what happened was inconsistent with the community we aspired to be. His message had an enormously positive effect.\nAlso, it is very important that the students themselves respond to offensive speech. They can hold counter-demonstrations, teach-ins and protests. All of that is protected speech. They just can\xe2\x80\x99t protest in a way that interferes with the ability of others to speak.\nThe law is clear that even in places that are open to speech, there can be time, place and manner restrictions, so long as there are adequate places for free speech. There is a right to speak on the campus, but there is no right to come into my classroom and shout me down. There is a right to use public streets and sidewalks, but a city can prevent trucks with sound amplification equipment from playing music in the middle of the night. Dormitories are also a very special place of repose for students. It\xe2\x80\x99s their home, and the Supreme Court has recognized the protection of privacy of people in their homes. So there can be much greater restrictions in dormitories \xe2\x80\x94 but it always has to be content neutral. It can\xe2\x80\x99t be based on content or message.\n Right, so you could say that no one is allowed to hang flags from their window, but not that no one is allowed to hang Confederate flags from their window.\n Exactly.\n Obviously violence \xe2\x80\x94 like what we saw in Charlottesville and could presumably expect near other college towns in the coming year \xe2\x80\x94 is not protected by the Constitution. But I have heard from many students that they are frustrated with the idea that people of color and other vulnerable demographic groups are responsible for staying nonviolent and peaceful when aggressive demonstrators march on their colleges. It\xe2\x80\x99s not that they want violence, but that they feel that they are being told to respond to aggression with passivity. Could you comment on that? I certainly understand where they are coming from.\n There is no right to engage in violence. Campuses can take steps to prevent violence \xe2\x80\x94 such as preventing weapons at demonstrations, having speakers be in areas where safety can best be assured, and moving counter-demonstrations to another area. Also, if speech is a true threat \xe2\x80\x94 causing a person to reasonably fear imminent physical harm \xe2\x80\x94 it is not protected by the First Amendment.\n What about the argument that some inflammatory speakers come to campus with the express aim of creating a hostile environment?\nIt is important to recognize that a public university has no choice but to allow speakers on campus even if their message is regarded as hateful or racist. If the campus tried to exclude such a speaker, it would get sued and the speaker would win and likely would be made a martyr for the First Amendment in the process. Nothing can be gained by exclusion. But the campus must ensure safety for its students, staff and faculty. This might include regulating where the controversial speaker is allowed to be present and, likely, it will include more of a police presence. I am sympathetic to the concerns of students who are wary about more police coming to campus, but not having law enforcement present in the face of a danger to public safety risks even greater harms.\nThe central principle of the First Amendment \xe2\x80\x94 and of academic freedom \xe2\x80\x94 is that all ideas and views can be expressed. Sometimes they are ideas and views that we might consider noble, that advance equality. Sometimes they might be ideas that we abhor. But there is no way to empower a government or campus administration to restrict speech without allowing for the possibility that tomorrow, it will be our speech that is restricted.\n'

aS'I sit facing the young German neurologist, across a small table in a theater in Hamburg, Germany. I\xe2\x80\x99m here giving one-on-one talks called \xe2\x80\x9cThe Unenhanced: What Has Happened to Those Deemed \xe2\x80\x98Unfit\xe2\x80\x99,\xe2\x80\x9d about my research on Aktion T4, the Nazi \xe2\x80\x9ceuthanasia\xe2\x80\x9d program to exterminate the disabled.\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m afraid of what you\xe2\x80\x99re going to tell me,\xe2\x80\x9d the neurologist says.\nI\xe2\x80\x99m not surprised. I\xe2\x80\x99ve heard similar things before. But this time is different \xe2\x80\x94 the young man sitting across from me is a doctor. Aktion T4 could not have happened without the willing participation of German doctors.\nI have a personal stake in making sure this history is remembered. In 1960, I was born missing bones in both legs. At the time, some thought I should not be allowed to live. Thankfully, my parents were not among them.\nI first discovered that people with disabilities were sterilized and killed by the Nazis when I was a teenager, watching the TV mini-series \xe2\x80\x9cHolocaust\xe2\x80\x9d in 1978. But it would be years before I understood the connections between the killing of the disabled and the killing of Jews and other \xe2\x80\x9cundesirables,\xe2\x80\x9d all of whom were, in one way or another, deemed \xe2\x80\x9cunfit.\xe2\x80\x9d\nThe neurologist does not know much about what I\xe2\x80\x99m telling him. While he does know that approximately 300,000 disabled people were killed in T4 and its aftermath, he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t know about the direct connection between T4 and the Holocaust. He doesn\xe2\x80\x99t know that it was at Brandenburg, the first T4 site, where methods of mass killing were tested, that the first victims of Nazi mass killings were the disabled, and that its personnel went on to establish and run the extermination camps at Treblinka, Belzec and Sobibor.\nThree years earlier, when I first arrived in Germany, I was consistently confronted with the treatment of those with disabilities under the Third Reich. But I soon realized I had to go back even farther. In the 1920s, the disabled were mistreated, sterilized, experimented on and killed in some German psychiatric institutions. In 1920, the psychiatrist Alfred Hoche and the jurist Karl Binding published their treatise, \xe2\x80\x9cPermitting the Destruction of Unworthy Life,\xe2\x80\x9d which became the blueprint for the exterminations of the disabled carried out by the Third Reich.\nIn Dr. Ewald Melzer\xe2\x80\x99s 1923 survey of the parents of the disabled children in his care, they were asked: \xe2\x80\x9cWould you agree definitely to a painless shortcut of your child\xe2\x80\x99s life, after it is determined by experts that it is incurably stupid?\xe2\x80\x9d The results, which surprised Melzer, were published in 1925: 73 percent responded they were willing to have their children killed if they weren\xe2\x80\x99t told about it.\nI am also Jewish. At the Karl Bonhoeffer psychiatric hospital in the Berlin suburb of Wittenau, where the exhibition \xe2\x80\x9cA Double Stigma: The Fate of Jewish Psychiatric Patients\xe2\x80\x9d was held, I learned about, as the exhibition title suggests, how Jewish patients were doubly stigmatized by being separated from other patients, denied pastoral care, and were cared for not at the expense of the Reich but by Jewish organizations. Jewish patients were singled out for early extermination; by December 1942, the destruction of the Jewish patient population at Wittenau was complete.\nThe young neurologist in Hamburg did not know this history.\nIt is only at the end of my talk with the neurologist that I notice he wears a hearing aid. I want to ask if he knows about \xe2\x80\x9c100 Percent,\xe2\x80\x9d the film produced by deaf Germans to show they could assimilate and be productive citizens who worked. Did he know the hereditary deaf were singled out not only by the German authorities but also by those with acquired deafness who tried to save themselves? Too often, even those of us with disabilities do not know our own history.\nNot many people know about disability history in the United States. They do not know that in the United States in 1927, Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes wrote that \xe2\x80\x9cthree generations of imbeciles are enough\xe2\x80\x9d as part of his opinion in \n, in which the Supreme Court ruled that compulsory sterilization of the \xe2\x80\x9cunfit\xe2\x80\x9d was constitutional. This decision has never been expressly overturned.\nMany Americans still do not know about the so-called \xe2\x80\x9cugly laws,\xe2\x80\x9d which in many states, beginning in the late 1860s, deemed it illegal for persons who were \xe2\x80\x9cunsightly or unseemly\xe2\x80\x9d to appear in public. The last of these laws was not repealed until 1974.\nWhy is it important to know this history? We often say what happened in Nazi Germany couldn\xe2\x80\x99t happen here. But some of it, like the mistreatment and sterilization of the disabled, did happen here.\nA reading of Hoche and Binding\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cPermitting the Destruction of Unworthy Life\xe2\x80\x9d shows the similarity between what they said and what exponents of practical ethics, such as Peter Singer, say about the disabled today. As recently as 2015, Singer, talking with the radio host Aaron Klein on his show, said, \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t want my health insurance premiums to be higher so that infants who can experience zero quality of life can have expensive treatments.\xe2\x80\x9d\nThese philosophers talk about the drain on \xe2\x80\x9cresources\xe2\x80\x9d caused by lives lived with a disability, which eerily echoes what Hoche and Binding wrote about the \xe2\x80\x9cfinancial and moral burden\xe2\x80\x9d on \xe2\x80\x9ca person\xe2\x80\x99s family, hospital, and state\xe2\x80\x9d caused by what they deem lives \xe2\x80\x9cunworthy of living.\xe2\x80\x9d\nExperts point out the recent Republican health care proposals would strip Medicaid funding that helps the elderly, the poor and the disabled live healthier and more dignified lives. A recent New York Times article \n, a retired Episcopal priest, as saying: \xe2\x80\x9cWhat we\xe2\x80\x99re paying for is something that many people wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t want if they had a choice. It\xe2\x80\x99s hundreds of dollars each day that could go towards their grandchildren\xe2\x80\x99s education or care for the people who could get well.\xe2\x80\x9d\nIn the article, Flanders, whose father had Alzheimer\xe2\x80\x99s, is described as \xe2\x80\x9cutterly unafraid to mix money into the conversation about the meaning of life when the mind deteriorates.\xe2\x80\x9d Practical ethicists are similarly unafraid to do this. As were the Nazis. Third Reich school textbooks included arithmetic problems on how much it would cost to care for a person with a disability for a lifetime.\nThree years ago, I was the only visitor at a museum dedicated to the history of the Reinickendorf area of Berlin. The museum building was once part of Wiesengrund, which, in 1941, housed the \xe2\x80\x9cwards for expert care\xe2\x80\x9d of the Municipal Hospital for Children.\nDown a hall with fluorescent lighting, in a white-walled room, were 30 wooden cribs. On each of the cribs was a history of a child, some as young as a few months old. This was the room in which these infants and children were experimented on and killed: the 30-bed Ward 3, the \xe2\x80\x9cward for expert care\xe2\x80\x9d at Wiesengrund.\nMy heart raced; my breath shortened. I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t stay in that room for long. The room evoked the first four weeks of my own life spent in an incubator. Nobody knew if I would live or die.\nWhat kind of society do we want to be? Those of us who live with disabilities are at the forefront of the larger discussion of what constitutes a valued life. What is a life worth living? Too often, the lives of those of us who live with disabilities are not valued, and feared. At the root of this fear is misunderstanding, misrepresentation, and a lack of knowledge of disability history and, thus, disabled lives.\n'

aS'I lived through two hurricanes as a child and I remember all the good stuff that eventually came in the mail \xe2\x80\x94 M&Ms, bug spray, playing cards. So when I heard that Hurricane Irma had made landfall on American soil last Wednesday, I began gathering those kinds of things to mail to my friends and family. I put the packages together and watched the news. There was nothing in what I saw about the hurricane hitting the United States.\nWhen I finally received a text from my Aunt Cecile on Thursday, she wrote, \xe2\x80\x9cThe post office is gone.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean \xe2\x80\x98gone\xe2\x80\x99?\xe2\x80\x9d I texted back. She responded with a list: \xe2\x80\x9cGrocery stores gone. Schools gone. Hospital gone.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean \xe2\x80\x98gone\xe2\x80\x99?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked again. \xe2\x80\x9cGone,\xe2\x80\x9d she texted again. \xe2\x80\x9cDemolished. No roof. No walls.\xe2\x80\x9d\nThat Sunday the news media made a big deal out of Irma\xe2\x80\x99s landfall on the Florida Keys as a Category 4 hurricane, and then on Florida itself. But in truth Irma had struck United States land days before as a disastrous Category 5 hurricane. That was when it hit the United States Virgin Islands, devastating my home island, St. Thomas. That was when my aunt texted, \xe2\x80\x9cGone.\xe2\x80\x9d\nMaybe you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard of the Virgin Islands, of St. Croix, St. Thomas and St. John. It\xe2\x80\x99s a good place to go on vacation, to fall in love, to have a wedding. One hundred years ago, the islands were called the Danish West Indies. Denmark sold the islands in 1917 to the United States for $25 million. The people who lived there, including my ancestors, were no longer Danish West Indians. As my cousin Norma remembers learning from older relatives, on the day of the transfer the Danish flag went down slowly on the flagpole. The American flag went zoom-zoom up. And then we were as American as Coca-Cola.\nIt took 10 more years for Virgin Islanders to actually be granted American citizenship. Before the transfer, the Danes and the Americans argued about trading us, with one Danish lawmaker said to have risen from his death bed to vote against the sale. Either way, the conversation about our future hadn\xe2\x80\x99t included us.\nToday Virgin Islanders are led by a president who makes clear delineations between \xe2\x80\x9creal\xe2\x80\x9d Americans and all the rest. True, the people of the Virgin Islands didn\xe2\x80\x99t vote for this current president. The people of the Virgin Islands didn\xe2\x80\x99t vote for \n president of our United States of America, because voting in the general election is not a privilege of citizenship that the federal government extends to us. Like the citizens of Puerto Rico, Guam and the other United States territories, we are not yet \n Americans. No wonder TV networks and even the president\xe2\x80\x99s homeland security adviser, Tom Bossert, can\xe2\x80\x99t seem to get it right.\nIn a press briefing last Friday, Mr. Bossert appeared to chastise the news media for not covering the government response to Hurricane Irma\xe2\x80\x99s assault on the Virgin Islands. Watching him, I held my breath, wondering if now someone would claim us. But he mentioned the evacuation of American citizens from the Virgin Islands in the same way he talked about the evacuation of American citizens from St. Maarten and St. Martin. I took him to mean: We are evacuating the real Americans from these foreign Caribbean islands.\nNowhere did he note that we should be concerned about this American land, because it \n American land. Has been for 100 years.\nIn the continental United States there has been little coverage of this centennial of Virgin Islands Americanness. In Transfer Day ceremonies in March, the Danish flag again went slowly down in the Virgin Islands and the American flag went soaring up. All this year Virgin Islanders have been marking our Americanness with such exercises of memory, but it is a bitter celebration. When we Virgin Islanders leave the Virgin Islands for the mainland, we find that we are immigrants in our own country.\nAs we have over the last 100 years, we ask again, with this storm: What kind of Americans are we? Are we part of a multitiered system of Americanness? Do the real Americans know about this? Are you, real Americans, O.K. with this? It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t seem particularly American to me.\nMy son, Nazareth, was born in New York City, but baptized in the Virgin Islands. He turned 1 year old on the same day that the Virgin Islands turned 100. I want for him what I want for any American \xe2\x80\x94 self-actualization, his rights granted and upheld, finding the love of his life and maybe marrying that person on a beach on St. Thomas.\nHe is an American and a Virgin Islander, which are the same thing. The history of the Virgin Islands is part of American history. And now, what happens in the Virgin Islands is happening in America. Before Hurricane Irma hit the continental United States, it had already affected at least 100,000 Americans. Not tourists visiting islands. Just 100,000 Americans, living in America\xe2\x80\x99s paradise, the United States Virgin Islands.\n'

aS'This month the Supreme Court will have a rare opportunity to correct a flawed doctrine that for the past two decades has relied on junk social science to justify punishing more than 800,000 Americans. Two cases that the court could review concern people on the sex offender registry and the kinds of government control that can constitutionally be imposed upon them.\nIn Snyder v. Doe, the court could consider whether Michigan\xe2\x80\x99s broad scheme of regulating sex offenders constitutes \xe2\x80\x9cpunishment.\xe2\x80\x9d The other case, Karsjens v. Piper, examines the constitutionality of Minnesota\xe2\x80\x99s policy of detaining sex offenders forever \xe2\x80\x94 not for what they\xe2\x80\x99ve done, but for what they might do.\nAnd while the idea of indefinite preventive detention might sound un-American or something out of the film \xe2\x80\x9cMinority Report,\xe2\x80\x9d the larger problem is that \xe2\x80\x9ccivil commitment,\xe2\x80\x9d like hundreds of other regulations imposed on those required to register, has been justified by assertions about the recidivism of sex offenders. But those assertions turn out to be entirely belied by science.\nFor the past 24 years, Minnesota has detained sex offenders released from prison in a \xe2\x80\x9ctherapeutic program\xe2\x80\x9d conveniently located on the grounds of a maximum-security prison in Moose Lake. The \xe2\x80\x9cpatients\xe2\x80\x9d are kept in locked cells, transported outside the facility in handcuffs and leg irons, and subjected to a regimen that looks, sounds and smells just like that of the prison it is adjacent to.\nBut unlike prison, this \xe2\x80\x9ctherapeutic\xe2\x80\x9d program, which aims to teach the patients to control their sexual impulses and was initially designed to last from two to four years, has no fixed end date. Rather, program administrators decide which patients are safe enough to release. In the 24 years it has existed, not a single \xe2\x80\x9cpatient\xe2\x80\x9d has ever been fully released. There are now about 850 people in the Minnesota Sex Offender Program, some with no adult criminal record, and others who, despite having completed every single program ever offered at the facility, have remained civilly committed for over 20 years.\nWhile civil commitment is perhaps the most extreme example of punishments imposed on people convicted of sex crimes, it is by no means the only one. Driven by a pervasive fear of sexual predators, and facing no discernible opposition, politicians have become evermore inventive in dreaming up ways to corral and marginalize those forced to register \xe2\x80\x94 a category which itself has expanded radically and come to include those convicted of \xe2\x80\x9csexting,\xe2\x80\x9d having consensual sex with non-minor teenagers or even urinating in public.\nThese sanctions include being forced to wear (and pay for) GPS monitoring and being banned from parks, and draconian residency restrictions that sometimes lead to homelessness. In addition, punishments can include, on pain of re-incarceration, undergoing interrogations using a penile plethysmograph, a device used to measure sexual arousal. They have also included requirements that those on the registry refrain from being alone with children (often including their own) and barred from holding certain jobs, like being a volunteer firefighter or driving an ice cream truck.\nAnd when these restrictions have been challenged in court, judge after judge has justified them based on a Supreme Court doctrine that allows such restrictions, thanks to the \xe2\x80\x9cfrightening and high\xe2\x80\x9d recidivism rate ascribed to sex offenders \xe2\x80\x94 a rate the court has pegged \xe2\x80\x9cas high as 80 percent.\xe2\x80\x9d The problem is this: The 80 percent recidivism rate is an entirely invented number.\nA few years ago, Ira Ellman, a professor of law at the University of California, Berkeley, and Tara Ellman set out to find the source of that 80 percent figure, and what he found shocked him. As it turns out, the court found that number in a brief signed by Solicitor General Ted Olson. The brief cited a Department of Justice manual, which in turn offered only one source for the 80 percent assertion: a Psychology Today article published in 1986.\nThat article was written not by a scientist but by a treatment provider who claimed to be able to essentially cure sex offenders though innovative \xe2\x80\x9caversive therapies\xe2\x80\x9d including electric shocks and pumping ammonia into offenders\xe2\x80\x99 noses via nasal cannulas. The article offered no backup data, no scientific control group and no real way to fact-check any of the assertions made to promote the author\xe2\x80\x99s program.\nNonetheless, because that 80 percent figure suited the government lawyers\xe2\x80\x99 aim of cracking down on sex offenders, Solicitor General Olson cited it, and Justice Anthony Kennedy, seemingly without fact-checking it, adopted the figure in a 2002 opinion that Justices William Rehnquist, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas joined. (Justice Sandra Day O\xe2\x80\x99Connor concurred.) Their decision blew open the doors to the glut of sex offender restrictions that followed.\nBut in the 30 years since that Psychology Today article was published, there have been hundreds of evidence-based, scientific studies on the question of the recidivism rate for sex offenders. The results of those studies are astonishingly consistent: Convicted sex offenders have among the lowest rates of same-crime recidivism of any category of offender.\nNearly every study \xe2\x80\x94 including those by states as diverse as Alaska, Nebraska, Maine, New York and California \xe2\x80\x94 as well as an extremely broad one by the federal government that followed every offender released in the United States for three years, has put the three-year recidivism rate for convicted sex offenders in the low single digits, with the bulk of the results clustering around 3.5 percent. Needless to say, there is a tremendous difference between claiming that 80 percent of offenders will re-offend and that more than 95 percent of them won\xe2\x80\x99t. And it is in that basic difference that the Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s doctrine has done its most lasting damage.\nThis profound misrepresentation of social science has led to extraordinary real-world harms. For example, while the public almost universally embraces the strict residency restrictions the Supreme Court and lower courts have ratified, study after study has shown that rather than reduce sexual violence, these residency restrictions actually increase recidivism.\nThe merciless enforcement of the conditions routinely placed on those on the registry has resulted in the constant re-incarceration of offenders \xe2\x80\x94 not because they have committed new crimes but for technical violations of the conditions themselves, like failure to maintain a driving log, being late for curfew or failing to pay polygraph fees.\nIndeed, a study by the California Department of Corrections concluded that 91 percent of sex offenders returned to California prisons were returned for these technical violations, while only 1.8 percent were returned as a result of having committed a new sex crime. In short, the entire scheme of registration and restriction that the Supreme Court condoned 15 years ago in McKune v. Lile has done enormous violence to a huge number of Americans now branded forever as sex offenders.\nNow more than ever, Americans should be able to look to our highest court and expect decisions that are based on reason and grounded in science rather than fear. The court must rule wisely and bravely, including being willing to acknowledge its mistake and finally correct the record. More than 800,000 Americans have needlessly suffered humiliation, ostracism, banishment re-incarceration and civil commitment thanks to a judicial opinion grounded in an unsourced, unscientific study. Simple decency and perhaps more important, intellectual honesty demands better.\n'

aS'Ben Shapiro is a 33-year-old who \n small government, religious liberty and free-market economics and opposes identity politics, abortion and Donald Trump. He is, in other words, that wildly exotic creature: a political conservative.\nYou\xe2\x80\x99d think that the cosmopolitan denizens of the San Francisco Bay Area would have encountered a few, if not in the form of an uncle at Thanksgiving, then perhaps in, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, a field trip down to Orange County. But to judge from the pre-emptive reaction to Mr. Shapiro\xe2\x80\x99s speech scheduled for this Thursday at the University of California, Berkeley, you\xe2\x80\x99d be mistaken.\nLast week Paul Alivisatos, the university\xe2\x80\x99s executive vice chancellor and provost, sent out a grave \n to students and faculty members. \xe2\x80\x9cWe are deeply concerned about the impact some speakers may have on individuals\xe2\x80\x99 sense of safety and belonging,\xe2\x80\x9d he wrote, encouraging his readers to avail themselves of campus counseling services. \xe2\x80\x9cNo one should be made to feel threatened or harassed simply because of who they are or for what they believe.\xe2\x80\x9d\nMr. Alivisatos wasn\xe2\x80\x99t referring to the various threats against Mr. Shapiro that you might imagine would be his chief concern: When the right-wing provocateur Milo Yiannopoulos visited campus in February, the resulting protests caused $100,000 in \n. This time around, the activist group Refuse Fascism, which has \n the left-wing extremist \n movement as \xe2\x80\x9ccourageous,\xe2\x80\x9d has taken the lead in condemning Mr. Shapiro\xe2\x80\x99s speech, calling him a \xe2\x80\x9cfascist\xe2\x80\x9d on campus fliers and declaring in a Facebook post that his goal was to \xe2\x80\x9cspread ugly fascist views dressed up in slick-talking \xe2\x80\x98intellectual\xe2\x80\x99 garb.\xe2\x80\x9d\nThe group has \n a rally during Mr. Shapiro\xe2\x80\x99s talk. It\xe2\x80\x99s no wonder the university has promised a \xe2\x80\x9cclosed perimeter\xe2\x80\x9d around the building where he is set to speak and an \xe2\x80\x9cincreased and highly visible police presence.\xe2\x80\x9d\nThere\xe2\x80\x99s no question that Ben Shapiro loves to provoke college students. He \n a diaper to a campus speech to offer to \xe2\x80\x9cself-indulgent pathetic children who can\xe2\x80\x99t handle anyone with an opposing point of view.\xe2\x80\x9d In another, while entertaining a question from a young woman who called for greater sensitivity toward transgender people, he \n: \xe2\x80\x9cIf I call you a moose are you suddenly a moose?\xe2\x80\x9d\nYet this sharp-tongued Never Trumper was also, according to the Anti-Defamation League, by far the \n Jewish journalist of 2016 \xe2\x80\x94 quite a distinction when you think about the kind of vitriol that gushed forth this past year on platforms like Twitter. Those attacks came from the alt-right, which called Mr. Shapiro a \xe2\x80\x9cChrist killer\xe2\x80\x9d and far worse. When his son was born, the trolls called the baby a \xe2\x80\x9cnewborn cockroach\xe2\x80\x9d and suggested that the entire Shapiro family head to the gas chambers.\nLet\xe2\x80\x99s hope the protest against this \xe2\x80\x9cfascist\xe2\x80\x9d who has been the regular target of actual ones doesn\xe2\x80\x99t result in any violence. But the brouhaha over Ben Shapiro is significant not because of what might go down Thursday at Berkeley, but because it is a perfect exhibition of a much broader phenomenon increasingly apparent in the wake of the Charlottesville, Va., demonstrations last month: the sloppy conflation between actual white supremacists and, well, run-of-the-mill conservatives, libertarians and classical liberals whose main beef is with some on the left who seem like they\xe2\x80\x99d rather do without the First Amendment.\nWhat happened at the Unite the Right protest in Charlottesville was the real article: a gathering of proud white supremacists, neo-Nazis and fellow travelers brandishing torches and flags and a Dodge Challenger in order to terrify residents, kill a counterprotester and injure 19 others.\nLater in August, however, there were long-planned free-speech protests across the country that had nothing to do with that ugly demonstration. Liberty Weekend in the Bay Area was one of them.\nThe demonstration was organized by the leader of a right-wing group Patriot Prayer, Joey Gibson, who advertised the event this way: \xe2\x80\x9cNo extremists will be allowed in. No Nazis, Communist, K.K.K., Antifa, white supremacist, I.E., or white nationalists. This is an opportunity for moderate Americans to come in with opposing views. We will not allow the extremists to tear apart this country. Specifically, Richard Spencer and Nathan Damigo will not be welcome.\xe2\x80\x9d\nPerhaps one of the reasons Mr. Gibson had to make his intentions \n is that in the past his events have attracted just the kind of people who are fans of anti-Semites and racists like Mr. Spencer: the \xe2\x80\x9cWestern-chauvinist\xe2\x80\x9d \n; the alt-right group \n, or I.E., which was founded last year by Mr. Damigo; plus fans of conspiracy theorists like Alex Jones.\nMr. Gibson had also assembled a list of speakers that included, according to the group\xe2\x80\x99s \n, only one white male. The others were Hispanic, black, Asian, Samoan and Muslim; two were women. Mr. Gibson himself is half-Japanese.\nYou wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have known any of this though, if you\xe2\x80\x99d listened to news reports or politicians, as Matt Labash pointed out in his \n about the event in The Weekly Standard.\nRepresentative Nancy Pelosi \n the event \xe2\x80\x9ca white supremacist rally\xe2\x80\x9d and criticized the National Park Service for giving Patriot Prayer a permit to gather in Crissy Field, not far from the Golden Gate Bridge: \xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99re going to give it as a venue to Nazis and white nationalists.\xe2\x80\x9d\nSenator Dianne Feinstein lent an amen with her own letter to the Park Service voicing her \n that the park would \xe2\x80\x9cbe used as a venue for Patriot Prayer\xe2\x80\x99s incitement, hate and intimidation.\xe2\x80\x9d\nState Senator Scott Wiener \n Patriot Prayer an \xe2\x80\x9cextremist group,\xe2\x80\x9d insisting that it was \xe2\x80\x9cnot interested in simply exercising free speech\xe2\x80\x9d with its event, but rather in creating \xe2\x80\x9ca volatile, chaotic, violent tinderbox.\xe2\x80\x9d\nSan Francisco\xe2\x80\x99s mayor, Ed Lee, asked residents to avoid \xe2\x80\x9cengaging with members of Patriot Prayer\xe2\x80\x9d lest anyone \xe2\x80\x9cdignify their message of hate and their mission of division in our city of love of compassion.\xe2\x80\x9d\nIn the end, however, the \n didn\xe2\x80\x99t emanate from Mr. Gibson\xe2\x80\x99s camp, but from antifa groups that \n to kick some fascist butt. Meantime, Mr. Gibson said things like \xe2\x80\x9cmoderates have to come together.\xe2\x80\x9d Strange words for an accused fascist. But when mainstream politicians are engaging in \n, should Mr. Gibson\xe2\x80\x99s branding as such come as any surprise?\nOne of my favorite things on YouTube is the famous 1965 debate between James Baldwin and William F. Buckley at Cambridge University. Baldwin wiped the floor with Buckley before the all-white British audience \xe2\x80\x94 the yeas \n the nays 540 to 160 on the proposition \xe2\x80\x9cThe American dream is at the expense of the American Negro.\xe2\x80\x9d\nCan anyone doubt that if Buckley tried to argue the same point today he would have been pelted with a \n, or shouted down, or \n or worse? Perhaps he would have just avoided the tiresome indignity by canceling the talk.\nWatch it. You\xe2\x80\x99ll be grateful he didn\xe2\x80\x99t.\n'

aS'Nineteen sixty-seven may have been a brutal year in Vietnam \xe2\x80\x94 tens of thousands of Vietnamese and more than 11,000 Americans lost their lives in what increasingly looked like an endless war \xe2\x80\x94 but it was also, the United Nations decreed more hopefully, International Tourist Year.\nThe National Tourist Office of the Republic of Vietnam \xe2\x80\x94 yes, the American-backed South Vietnamese government maintained a tourism office during the war \xe2\x80\x94 issued a cheerful guidebook touting the conflict-ravaged country as an enticing destination. With its sophisticated mountain resorts, fine white beaches, extensive hunting reserves and numerous other attractions, Vietnam was \xe2\x80\x9crapidly becoming a \xe2\x80\x98must see\xe2\x80\x99 for thousands of foreign tourists,\xe2\x80\x9d it maintained.\nThe claim was, of course, ludicrous. Few tourists were making the trip to Vietnam by 1967, and those who did largely stuck to the capital. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s rather risky to go far from Saigon,\xe2\x80\x9d the chief tourism official conceded that spring. Yet the guidebook\xe2\x80\x99s publication, as bizarre as it may seem, reminds us of the extent to which tourism was about far more than travel. For both the Republic of Vietnam and the United States, tourism contained an important political dimension.\nThere was a time, in the late 1950s and early \xe2\x80\x9960s, when Vietnam did attract thousands of pleasure-seeking visitors. Holiday magazine profiled the country in 1957, and Travel magazine did a piece on Vietnam\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cspectacular\xe2\x80\x9d sites two years later. By the early 1960s, South Vietnam was enjoying tens of thousands of foreign visitors. This was great news for both Washington and Saigon.\nNot only would tourism promote the economic development and foreign-currency earnings that were so crucial to the South Vietnamese nation-building project, but, officials hoped, it also could generate positive views of the Republic of Vietnam and its contribution to Washington\xe2\x80\x99s Cold War mission. This was true of both the in-country experiences of foreign tourists as well as the ideologically inflected literature they relied on to mediate their travel.\nIn the years following the 1954 Geneva Accords that temporarily divided Vietnam, the South Vietnamese authorities, using tourism as one of the tools in their soft-power arsenal, attempted to overcome the crisis of legitimacy that imperiled their fledgling state. The republic\xe2\x80\x99s first president, Ngo Dinh Diem, was deeply unpopular, but both independent and government-produced tourism publications overlooked his political shortcomings in favor of a Cold War narrative that portrayed Diem as an effective nation-builder and one of the free world\xe2\x80\x99s greatest assets.\nThe Communist hordes in Vietnam, one American guidebook insisted, sought nothing less than \xe2\x80\x9cto enslave the entire population.\xe2\x80\x9d Fortunately, Diem \xe2\x80\x94 \xe2\x80\x9ca man of great vigor, vision and iron will\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 was there to stop them, \xe2\x80\x9cOlson\xe2\x80\x99s Orient Guide\xe2\x80\x9d continued.\nThe tourism publications of the 1950s and \xe2\x80\x9960s consistently touted the American-backed government\xe2\x80\x99s alleged democratic credentials while delegitimizing the Vietnamese revolution as naked Communist aggression. The southern republic was thus \xe2\x80\x9cFree Vietnam,\xe2\x80\x9d according to Travel magazine. The Democratic Republic of Vietnam, conversely, was the \xe2\x80\x9cCommunist-dominated\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cCommunist-held North.\xe2\x80\x9d\nNone of this is particularly surprising in the context of Cold War ideology. But it underscores a largely overlooked facet of the Vietnam War: Tourism and its attendant literature played a surprising yet significant role in wartime propaganda. Not only did this literature frame the political unrest in the South for travelers hungry for information, but it was also disseminated outside Southeast Asia. The \xe2\x80\x9cGuide to Viet-Nam\xe2\x80\x9d published by South Vietnam\xe2\x80\x99s Washington embassy, for example, was ostensibly created for tourists and, generously sprinkled with attractive photographs, included all sorts of information on the points of interest, festivals and Vietnamese culture certain to appeal to foreign visitors. Yet the 40-page guide, which touted the \xe2\x80\x9cfree democratic system in the South\xe2\x80\x9d and the instrumental role it played in \xe2\x80\x9cthe ideological contest between the Communist and the Free Worlds,\xe2\x80\x9d was also distributed to hundreds of American schoolteachers for use in their classrooms.\nThe growing importance of tourism publications was consistent with the diplomatic significance the United States attached to international travel in the 1950s, as the jet age and the growth of the middle class enabled hundreds of thousands of Americans to begin venturing abroad. Most of them knew little of the political complexities and nuances of decolonization, making the travel literature on which they relied that much more important. It would explain the world they were seeing and experiencing. For most tourist publications, the leftist revolutions springing up in Asia, Africa and Latin America became instances of Communist subversion, and Communism, Americans were told, required a \xe2\x80\x9cfree world\xe2\x80\x9d response.\nThe growth of international travel in the 1950s also meant ideologically preparing Americans to serve as unofficial ambassadors for their nation. The Eisenhower administration underscored this obligation by issuing a presidential letter to all American passport holders in 1957. It stressed tourists\xe2\x80\x99 role in helping to \xe2\x80\x9cmold the reputation of our country,\xe2\x80\x9d bringing \xe2\x80\x9cassurance to the people you meet that the United States is a friendly nation and one dedicated to the search for world peace and to the promotion of the well-being and security of the community of nations.\xe2\x80\x9d\nBut tourism did not benefit only Washington. For the government in Saigon, the positive experiences of American tourists and the stories they subsequently told about their visits could be a diplomatic boon. As a motto of the National Tourist Office put it, tourism would \xe2\x80\x9cmake the country better known and thus better loved.\xe2\x80\x9d\nFor a time, things seemed to go as planned. The American actor George C. Scott, for example, went to Vietnam in 1965 and meditated on his experience in Esquire magazine. \xe2\x80\x9cWhether we like it or not, we are and have been for years at war with International Communism,\xe2\x80\x9d he wrote. \xe2\x80\x9cThe Vietnamese conflict is a unique and necessary phase of that larger war, the consequences of which may not be sidestepped, or shirked, or diplomatized under a polished table.\xe2\x80\x9d\nThe Follett family of Oak Park, Ill., made the trip the following year. \xe2\x80\x9cWe came because we wanted to see what was happening in Vietnam ourselves,\xe2\x80\x9d Dwight Follett told Saturday Review. \xe2\x80\x9cIn the United States, everything we read is either black or white.\xe2\x80\x9d His assessment? \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m coming out of this more a hawk than a dove. We must help these people.\xe2\x80\x9d\nBy 1967, with the war\xe2\x80\x99s continuing escalation, the flow of tourists into the country, already seriously diminished, had nearly dried up. The publisher Fodor\xe2\x80\x99s, whose annual guidebooks proved some of the most popular of the mid-20th century, explained why. After offering tepid encouragement about seeing Vietnam through 1966, its 1967 prognosis was grim: \xe2\x80\x9cThis divided nation, torn by war for twenty years, is the most dangerous country in the world for today\xe2\x80\x99s visitor.\xe2\x80\x9d Its advice? \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t ever yield to the temptation\xe2\x80\x9d to go.\nMost didn\xe2\x80\x99t. More than 34,000 foreign civilians did arrive in Vietnam in 1967, but they were almost exclusively businesspeople, journalists, contractors and government officials. Actual sightseers numbered, at most, in the low hundreds. And they largely remained in Saigon. This was quite a departure from the early years of the nation-building project.\nAs the 1960s folded into the 1970s, things only got worse. The ideological appeal of tourism seemed a thing of the past. Indeed, by 1973, the year the last American combat forces withdrew, the director of the National Tourist Office took to openly encouraging the prostitution of Vietnamese women. \xe2\x80\x9cSoon I will send up a proposal for \xe2\x80\x98sex tourism,\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9d he told an American reporter. \xe2\x80\x9cMany people want to visit Vietnam not to see the mountains or the shopping but to try, just once, our girls.\xe2\x80\x9d\nThis was the moral abyss into which Vietnamese tourism, like the American war it served, had sunk. It\xe2\x80\x99s little wonder that the revolution prevailed.\n'

aS'Technology threatens to fundamentally change the nature of elections and democratic governance.\nNew media forms, including social media, are fueling political polarization as people communicate with general audiences and narrowly focused groups, without the deliberation typical of traditional forms of communication. Hacking, misinformation, \xe2\x80\x9c\n\xe2\x80\x9d and cybersecurity threats are expanding the power of a few while undermining public confidence in the accuracy of mass media and information. Politicians are using detailed voter information to play to their bases, allowing them to ignore the rest of their constituents.\nDemocratization, which had advanced steadily for decades, is now threatened by the rise of authoritarian governments and the closing of the political space to civil society, journalists and others.\nAdvances in election technology are also bringing new opportunities and new fears \xe2\x80\x94 founded and unfounded \xe2\x80\x94 about the security of the election process. Technology is being introduced into electoral processes to promote efficiency, but it also moves voting and counting into the unobservable digital realm. In the Netherlands, \n amid concerns about foreign interference in elections. During the 2016 presidential campaign in the United States, \n broke into the Democratic National Committee\xe2\x80\x99s email system, most likely trying to influence the election\xe2\x80\x99s outcome.\nWe must accommodate these changing times while holding true to our unchanging principles \xe2\x80\x94 equality, justice and freedom for all. This means building political processes that are inclusive and transparent and that hold those in power accountable.\nIn the United States, our path has been nonlinear and riddled with failures, including slavery, racial and sexual discrimination, and abuse of indigenous peoples. The gap between rich and poor has grown wider in recent decades, while longstanding barriers to voter participation, equal justice and economic opportunities for all remain. Nevertheless, we persevere, striving to correct and improve our democracy.\nInternationally, globalization has contributed to increasing wealth, but billions of people still struggle under crushing poverty. We now face the threat of that wealth influencing the outcome of elections and subsequent government decisions.\nOur society has worked to develop global norms and an international system to protect human rights for decades, from the development of the United Nations and the adoption of the \n in 1948 to current worldwide efforts to secure political, economic and social rights. At the Carter Center, we helped strengthen the United Nations\xe2\x80\x99 system. During the course of \n, we also worked to build consensus on international election standards that are rooted in human rights commitments.\nGenuine elections are essential for people to express their political will, but elections cannot guarantee democratic governance. This will be even more true as digital technology advances. It\xe2\x80\x99s essential that we manage these changes within the broader framework of strengthening our commitment to human rights and democracy \xe2\x80\x94 not to threaten self-governance, but rather to safeguard it.\nThis means improving systems for inclusive and effective political participation, including full and easy (or even automatic) access to voter registration processes and appropriate identification for all. This is especially critical for groups that have faced \n, including women, racial and ethnic minorities, indigenous people, the elderly, the disabled and those living in extreme poverty.\nTransparency in elections and political processes is needed to build trust and popular confidence. Voters must be able to freely examine key information about governance and about electoral processes and results. For example, in the United States, voting technologies should include paper trails that can be audited; there should be fewer barriers to independent nonpartisan observers; and the results of audits and reviews should be readily available to the public.\nEffective voter participation in governance and policy-making in the digital era will require additional protections for rights and freedoms such as freedom of expression and association and access to information \xe2\x80\x94 including the internet. Citizens will need better tools to assess the quality and accuracy of information, such as fact-checking apps that crosscheck information against recognized sources and databases.\nWe must also develop legal frameworks and technological systems that protect privacy and the security of our personal information, with processes for independent oversight. People must be able to learn what data is being gathered about them and who has access to it.\nWe must understand how all of this information is being used by media, corporations, governments and others to shape political views and behavior, and develop and implement standards and codes of practice to ensure that this does not undermine our common principles.\nIn these and other challenges, the enduring principles of democracy and human rights must be our guiding lights, or the digital future could be dark indeed.\n'

aS'More than 25 years after the collapse of the Soviet Union and the attempt to build a democracy in its place, Russia has once again become an authoritarian state. The same inability to build democratic institutions plagued the leaders of the February Revolution of 1917, which led to the Bolsheviks gaining power later that year.\nRussian authoritarianism has profound consequences not just for Russian citizens, but also for neighboring countries and the rest of the world. Still burdened by a \xe2\x80\x9cbesieged fortress\xe2\x80\x9d mentality, the Kremlin pursues a foreign policy aimed at achieving a \xe2\x80\x9cbalance of forces\xe2\x80\x9d between Moscow and the West.\nThis outdated strategy creates a hysteria for military adventurism that threatens the entire planet. Pro-Kremlin propagandists such as \n, a well-known state TV host, have even suggested that \xe2\x80\x9caggressive behavior\xe2\x80\x9d from the United States could prompt a nuclear response from Russia.\nIt is not surprising that the Kremlin is using \n and other \n to sow confusion in Western countries and undermine faith in democratic systems. Russia\xe2\x80\x99s leaders are convinced that Western democracy is a threat to the authoritarian order in a country they have cowed into submission.\nFor Moscow, this is a zero-sum game: Any weakening or discrediting of democracy can benefit only the Kremlin\xe2\x80\x99s system of rule. But this is shortsighted. The rupture of the Western alliance could create serious instability throughout the world, exposing Russia to dangers it would likely be unable to manage.\nTo find an alternative system of government, Russian democrats like myself need to make sense of our country\xe2\x80\x99s unfortunate history. Doing so raises the inevitable question: Do Russia\xe2\x80\x99s size, political culture and distrust of the Western world make it unsuitable for democracy?\nAbsolutely not.\nI reject the fallacy that Russians are somehow incapable of building democratic institutions. People said the same thing about the Germans. How wrong they were. Countries and their citizens do change, usually in response to their own failures.\nThe majority of Russians have never experienced democratic institutions and don\xe2\x80\x99t understand how they function. But Russians who have moved to the West have adapted quickly and easily to democratic conditions. They see how democracy protects individual rights and property, and allows societies to flourish.\nDespite an insufficient understanding of democratic practices, Russia today has tens of thousands of civic organizations defending civil rights. A 2012 \n from the Pew Research Center showed that a majority of Russians support honest elections and a fair judiciary. The Russian people want their voices heard and their leaders held accountable: They want a different political system.\nTo avoid the mistakes of the past, we need to determine why Russia\xe2\x80\x99s two attempts to establish democracy in the 20th century led to new authoritarian regimes. In both cases, having overthrown one tyrant \xe2\x80\x94 the czar in 1917 and communism in 1991 \xe2\x80\x94 Russia ended up handing over power to another.\nHow did this happen?\nAt the beginning of the 20th century, conservatives and liberals were unable to find a common language to discuss a democratic foundation for Russia. As a result, the most reactionary faction within the governing elite came to dominate after the revolution of 1905, stymieing the development of democratic reforms.\nAfter the overthrow of the czar in 1917, democracy once again lost out. The Bolsheviks were in essence just as autocratic as the reactionaries who came before them, only with the opposite \xe2\x80\x9cideological polarity.\xe2\x80\x9d They may have managed to swap the minus and plus signs in a few places, but the Bolsheviks were never able to break free of the magnetic field of Russian authoritarianism.\nHistory repeated itself with the rise of Boris Yeltsin, even though he was Russia\xe2\x80\x99s first popularly elected leader. In the early 1990s, the new president was granted extraordinary constitutional powers, with victorious liberals referring to Mr. Yeltsin as \xe2\x80\x9cczar.\xe2\x80\x9d When Vladimir V. Putin was first elected president in 2000, the former K.G.B. lieutenant colonel inherited a system perfectly designed to sustain Russia\xe2\x80\x99s authoritarian traditions.\nA significant part of the Russian opposition today, unlike opposition movements in the West, sees democratic rights as emanating not from balanced political representation, but from the appointment of a \xe2\x80\x9cgood czar.\xe2\x80\x9d\nThis tendency to pursue a magnanimous ruler instead of democratic institutions forces ambitious political leaders to seek public support by relying on the force of their own personality rather than on a clear political program. To win, politicians need to create an image of a \xe2\x80\x9cstrong leader.\xe2\x80\x9d\nThe challenge facing democratically minded Russians therefore isn\xe2\x80\x99t simply to remove Mr. Putin from power; it\xe2\x80\x99s to replace the authoritarian system he personifies.\nThe events of 1917 and 1991 teach us that the Kremlin cannot establish democracy by decree, and that democratic institutions will not spring up across the whole of Russia\xe2\x80\x99s territory at once.\nThe process must begin with the political transformation of European-oriented Russia and its cities: Moscow, St. Petersburg, Yekaterinburg and Novosibirsk, among others.\nThese urban centers can demonstrate to the rest of the country how a majority of the voters can respect the minority, and vice versa, by bringing decision-making closer to the people and by holding officials genuinely accountable.\nWhen Russian society becomes aware of its own power, its people will find the will to develop a dynamic local democratic culture and the institutions required to support it. The most important task is to create a justice system based on the rule of law rather than on arbitrary power.\nTo the Kremlin, these ideas are heresy: They undermine the centuries-old beliefs that Russia can be effectively governed only from Moscow and that the delegation of power will lead to chaos.\nWe must embrace a new and radically different form of governance if we want Russia to be a successful, respected country able to make a positive contribution to international relations.\nThe 1990s teach us another lesson: that it is the Russian people, and the Russian people alone, who must find their own way forward. The West cannot do it for us.\n'

aS'For the first time in a generation, there is widespread anxiety about the possibility of nuclear war, stimulated by the extreme tensions between North Korea and the United States. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson has advised Americans that they can \n at night, a reassurance that most people probably wish they did not need to hear.\nMr. Tillerson offered his soothing counsel to deflate media hype about recent threats and counterthreats exchanged between Pyongyang and Washington. His words also reflect profound unease about the temperament and judgment of the two leaders who could trigger inadvertent war: President Trump and Kim Jong-un.\nMr. Trump and Mr. Kim appear to believe that bombast serves their domestic needs. Both seem to think that they can dominate and intimidate through the direst of threats. However, words can easily have consequences that neither leader seems to grasp.\nShould we be living in a world where two leaders can stumble into a nuclear holocaust? North Korea\xe2\x80\x99s accelerated pursuit of nuclear weapons clearly requires a much-enhanced containment and deterrence policy by the United States and its allies to prevent Mr. Kim from undertaking ever-riskier options. But what can be done to constrain the actions of an American president \n is now openly questioned, even by the Republican chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Bob Corker of Tennessee?\nTo limit the possibilities of an almost unimaginable conflict, there is a need to pursue a long overdue legislative remedy.\nUnder Article I of the Constitution, only Congress can declare war. Yet during America\xe2\x80\x99s numerous wars since World War II, presidents have never sought such authorization. The major reason? Nuclear weapons. There was widespread agreement that the president needed maximum flexibility to respond to a Soviet attack and that involving Congress would cause undue delays in a moment of crisis. As a result, the president has had essentially unchecked power to wage war, including launching a nuclear strike.\nHowever, strategic planners understood the risks of enabling a single officer in a silo in North Dakota, perhaps under the most stressful conditions imaginable, to initiate a nuclear strike. The nuclear command-and-control system therefore entailed a \xe2\x80\x9ctwo key\xe2\x80\x9d system requiring simultaneous actions by two officers to activate a launch.\nThe time is long overdue to introduce comparable checks at the highest levels of the executive branch. The strategic circumstances faced by the United States today are altogether different from those during the Cold War. Despite heightened tensions triggered by Russian revanchism in Ukraine and elsewhere in Central and Eastern Europe, the real risk of nuclear war emanates from a rogue actor, and North Korea heads the list. Almost casual presidential invocations of fire and fury have rendered circumstances far more dangerous.\nThe United States should in no way diminish its ability to respond to a nuclear or conventional attack by North Korea against United States territory or the territory of an ally. However, we should put in place a system of constraints to ensure that a preventive or pre-emptive nuclear strike by the United States must be evaluated through a careful, deliberative process.\nCongress should therefore amend the War Powers Act to cover the possibility of preventive or pre-emptive nuclear strikes. This would ensure that the president could not simply provide the codes to his military aide carrying the nuclear \xe2\x80\x9cfootball\xe2\x80\x9d and launch such an attack on his own authority.\nLegislation should provide for a small group of officials, possibly including the vice president, the secretary of defense, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the four leaders of the House and Senate, to give unanimous consent to any such nuclear strike. It would ensure that multiple sets of eyes, equipped with stable emotions and sound brains, would be able to prevent such a nuclear strike undertaken without appropriate deliberation.\nThis proposal would raise difficult constitutional questions. All presidential administrations have deemed the War Powers Act to be unconstitutional. Giving officers appointed by the president and subject to his direction formal veto power over military decisions could be problematic and precedent setting. If so, confining the veto power to the congressional leadership might be a preferable alternative.\nEven during the Cold War, there was great risk in ceding to one person the ability to kill millions in a flash. There is no good reason to enable an American president to retain absolute authority in circumstances completely unlike those faced during the Cold War.\nAssurances that nuclear weapons remain an option of absolute last resort, to be considered only after the concurrence of leaders from the executive branch and from the Congress, would also calm the nerves of United States allies deeply troubled by loose talk about the resort to nuclear weapons.\nThis is not to suggest that President Trump nurses some secret desire to launch a nuclear attack. However, the United States needs to act very prudently in dealing with an isolated and uniquely adversarial state. For its part, Congress has the power to prevent hair-trigger responses or impulsive actions that could lead to nuclear war.\n'

aS'In June 1967, in the freewheeling spirit of the times, I dropped out of Antioch College, in Ohio, and hitchhiked to New York. I was 19, mildly though not madly political. In junior high, I had joined civil rights demonstrations. Now I opposed the Vietnam War. But my ideology was simply the counterculture\xe2\x80\x99s: peace and love, plus anything fun that could undermine convention.\nI floated into that summer in a luminous haze of artistic impulse, magical thinking and pot smoke. But by September, things were darkening. Reality \xe2\x80\x94 menace \xe2\x80\x94 began to intrude. I found a focus. I joined the staff of Students for a Democratic Society, the principal organization of the New Left; I became an organizer. By year\xe2\x80\x99s end, I was calling myself a revolutionary.\nTwo years later, I would help found the militant Weatherman group, a breakaway faction of the S.D.S. Weatherman picked ruinous sectarian fights within S.D.S., and violent street battles with the cops. Later we went underground and carried out a campaign of bombings. By then, I was no longer the gentle hippie of 1967. But it was actually during 1967 that I changed.\nI had come to New York with a notion to get into theater \xe2\x80\x94 to be a stage manager or lighting designer, an actor or dancer. I took some classes, participated in some workshop productions. I crashed with a friend on East 11th Street, between Avenues B and C. That was still called the Lower East Side; its tony rebranding as the East Village came later.\nIt was a rough, polyglot slum, buildings decaying and pavements strewn with the fragments of shattered windshields. But this was supposed to be the Summer of Love. For a while I acted as if I were in San Francisco, as if there were flowers in my hair. Sometimes I strolled to Tompkins Square Park \xe2\x80\x94 barefoot. At the Paradox, a macrobiotic restaurant where brown-paper grocery bags served as lampshades, you got rice and vegetables for a buck. Seating was at a communal table \xe2\x80\x94 or out back in the \xe2\x80\x9cgarden,\xe2\x80\x9d a narrow patch of concrete between dirty-brick tenements. I recall idly dropping light bulbs down our own 11th Street air shaft, just to hear the experimental music of small implosions and tinkling glass.\nBut my soundtrack mostly came from folk rockers, like Jesse Colin Young. His iconic \xe2\x80\x9c\n,\xe2\x80\x9d with its admonition to \xe2\x80\x9clove one another right now,\xe2\x80\x9d came out that year. So did his \xe2\x80\x9c\n.\xe2\x80\x9d Its chorus goes, \xe2\x80\x9cNow the dream has ended, the world that I intended crashing down into bitter reality.\xe2\x80\x9d It was actually a song of broken romance. I misheard it as political commentary, because crashing into bitter reality felt like what was happening.\nIt began with that summer\xe2\x80\x99s race riots: Newark in mid-July, followed by Detroit; Cambridge, Md.; and dozens of other cities. One afternoon, I went to Tompkins Square not to get stoned, for a change, but to join a rally against police brutality. The \n of The New York Review of Books depicted a schematic of a Molotov cocktail; you could easily have followed it to assemble one. This image blazed from news stands all over town. It burned into my consciousness, although my takeaway was hardly a brilliant insight: The match that lights a joint might also ignite an uprising.\nMy earliest political gestures had been for civil rights. Now the riots in black communities \xe2\x80\x94 the rage that fueled them, and the authorities\xe2\x80\x99 savage responses \xe2\x80\x94 made that nonviolent movement and its legal achievements seem hollow. They weren\xe2\x80\x99t hollow. But I was 19, impatient and getting angry. The escalating war and ostensible powerlessness of its growing opposition was making me angrier.\nSome half a million people \xe2\x80\x94 roughly equal to the number of American troops deployed by then in Vietnam \xe2\x80\x94 had joined a national antiwar mobilization in April. In June, 15,000 people marched on a Los Angeles hotel where the president was speaking; they were attacked by 1,500 riot police \xe2\x80\x94 white people, liberals, beaten by cops. Pacifists bearing moral witness were staging hunger strikes. Young men pledging resistance were burning their draft cards.\nI was called up for induction into the military that year. I received an immediate, permanent deferment because a shrink I\xe2\x80\x99d been seeing wrote a letter explaining that I was homosexual. I was glad to have an out, but it was so humiliating to admit to being gay, back then, that for years I lied to anyone who asked, even close friends. I pretended the letter only said I was crazy \xe2\x80\x94 a lesser shame. I was angry about all that, too.\nIn September, I moved into my first solo apartment, a grim cell on East 6th Street. Soon I had a pair of pivotal experiences. I may be reversing their order, but they were so close in time and correlated in effect that it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter. The pivot in question was that from fear to bravado.\nOne evening I stood shaving, naked, before my uncurtained window, careless that I was on display to the street. Suddenly a young man came pounding on my door, shouting hysterically: \xe2\x80\x9cYou insulted my mother! I have a knife! I\xe2\x80\x99m going to kill you.\xe2\x80\x9d What I could glimpse of his face was distorted by his fury and the fisheye peephole in my door, behind which I cowered. He went away, returned again screaming threats and finally left for good. I never did recognize him on the street, nor did a physical encounter ensue. Still, it was terrifying. I felt queasy until I moved again, a few months later. Thus, for me, the Summer of Love\xe2\x80\x99s helium balloon fell to earth.\nMy best friend had quit Antioch when I did, to join the S.D.S. New York staff. Through him I was meeting a more politically committed circle. In October, I went along to Washington for a national demonstration targeting the Pentagon. The night before the march, I joined a secret propaganda action. People went out to spray-paint slogans on buses. This may not seem radical, but back then cities and transit systems were not slathered in graffiti. I went to a lot where buses parked overnight. Access was easy; there wasn\xe2\x80\x99t even a fence. Moving down the dark rows with my paint canister blasting felt utterly without risk. Then I had a thought. What if a watchman steps suddenly into my path? Then I had another thought. I\xe2\x80\x99ll spray him in the face and blind him. Easy.\nMy commitment to pacifism had been superficial, just something I casually assumed. It seemed inseparable from the morality and idealism of the civil rights movement. My light-bulb moment among the parked buses was equally nonchalant. I embraced the idea of physical action, without a care for possible consequences. As thoughtlessly as I had supposed myself to be a pacifist, I gave myself permission for violence.\nThe demonstration the next day and the ones to come were increasingly combative. I always hated confrontation, and still do. I was always afraid in those situations. So it may seem paradoxical that within weeks I joined the S.D.S. staff. After that, my fear of fighting never stopped me from encouraging militance and organizing actions in which people could be hurt. If I often avoided going toe-to-toe with the riot squad, I certainly smashed my share of windshields. Strutting and provocation were camouflage for my fear, and for the taint of weakness most people then \xe2\x80\x94 including me \xe2\x80\x94 thought inextricable from being gay.\nI immersed myself in radicalism for many reasons. I felt betrayed by a democracy so deeply racist and unequal. The stupefying carnage of the war repulsed me. A na\xc3\xafve vision of communism seemed attractive. Plus, passionate involvement replaced my untethered existence with community, a persona, a job and \xe2\x80\x94 however unrealistic \xe2\x80\x94 a life plan. Alongside these motivations were those knottier psychological ones.\nThen, as now, millions were moved to political action \xe2\x80\x94 and were often met with brutality by the state. But few besides us chose to deliberately instigate and justify violence. Maybe some of my comrades were more self-aware, or had less to pretend to or cover for. I can\xe2\x80\x99t speak for them. I only realized my own confusion of impulses years later. I would have been an activist anyway. But I wonder what other more creative, less destructive ways I might have found to be one.\n'

aS'Next month marks the seventh anniversary of the cholera outbreak that ravaged Haiti. The disease, which can cause death within hours if left untreated, came less than a year after Haiti was rocked by an enormous earthquake that left hundreds of thousands dead and millions injured, displaced and destitute.\nHaiti is prone to earthquakes and tropical storms \xe2\x80\x94 the island was spared the worst of Hurricane Irma last week \xe2\x80\x94 but the cholera outbreak was an anomaly; the disease had never before struck Haiti. It was brought in, it is widely believed, by United Nations peacekeepers from Nepal. One of the world\xe2\x80\x99s most infectious waterborne diseases, cholera spreads quickly and has proved extremely difficult to contain in Haiti. Over 10,000 have died and nearly a million have been stricken to date.\nBut one organization has managed to nearly eradicate it in a large slum in Port-au-Prince that lacks clean water and sanitation.\nOne of the game changers that would surprise most people, including global health experts, was actually a building. It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t just any building, but a very intelligently and beautifully designed one: the Cholera Treatment Center, operated by Les Centres Gheskio, an acronym that stands for the Haitian Group for the Study of Kaposi\xe2\x80\x99s Sarcoma and Opportunistic Infections.\nGheskio, founded in 1982 in the early days of the AIDS epidemic, provides primary care services free of charge to people suffering from tuberculosis, malnutrition, and other life threatening conditions in an area of the Haitian capital that is home to 60,000 Haitians. (Gheskio is a less well-known sister organization of Partners in Health, which focuses on Haiti\xe2\x80\x99s rural population.)\nAfter the 2010 earthquake, Gheskio\xe2\x80\x99s multi-acre campus was badly damaged. So the organization erected emergency tents to serve as a makeshift cholera treatment clinic. Once cholera reached Port-au-Prince, patients showed up on foot or were carried in wheelbarrows, around the clock.\nCholera manifests with extreme diarrhea and vomiting. Virtually all liquid is excreted from the body, causing victims to die of dehydration within hours of full manifestation if untreated. It is relatively easy to treat, but patients must be rehydrated immediately. To prevent it from spreading, infected human waste must be managed carefully.\nGheskio\xe2\x80\x99s founder, Jean W. Pape, an infectious disease specialist and native of Haiti, knew that eradicating cholera would take years. So even as the organization struggled to keep up with the influx of patients during the first year of the epidemic, he embarked on a long-term solution: building a permanent treatment center.\nGheskio turned to MASS Design Group, a Boston-based nonprofit organization that specializes in architecture that promotes dignity and justice in resource-limited settings. It has built hospitals, health-worker housing, schools and civic spaces around the world, including a tuberculosis hospital for Gheskio. MASS Design began by studying the conditions inside the tents.\nTents provide relative shade and privacy but offer limited light and poor ventilation, trapping warm air and compounding the smell of bodily waste. The materials become worn by rain, wind and sun, and must be replaced routinely. Because of the nature of cholera, the makeshift beds, fashioned out of old fiberglass school chairs and costly army cots, also didn\xe2\x80\x99t last long.\nMost problematic, Gheskio was relying on manual removal of human waste by an outside vendor. This was both costly and risky: The organization couldn\xe2\x80\x99t ensure its disposal would not recontaminate the water table, risking the infection of others.\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe did some back-of-envelope calculations and found that over a 10-year span of time, which was then considered optimistic for how long it would take to get rid of cholera, the tents and manual waste disposal system they were then using would cost Gheskio in excess of $500,000,\xe2\x80\x9d according to a co-founder of MASS Design, Alan Ricks.\nRicks estimated that MASS Design could build, for a comparable sum, a permanent structure that could be repurposed once the epidemic was fully contained. So MASS Design and Gheskio joined forces to raise philanthropic funding from the Deutsche Bank Foundation, Barr Foundation and individual donors, and began work.\nOne important innovation, developed with Fall Creek Engineers, based in Santa Cruz, Calif., was to bring a water-purification technology to Haiti called anaerobic baffled reactors. The reactors are a form of septic system that uses bacteria to treat sewage and contaminated water, turning it into clean water. Reactors, buried under the cholera center, force water through five chambers, each successively increasing the level of purification.\nEach week, Pape receives a detailed report on the water quality. The system sanitizes and recycles 250,000 gallons of water annually, ensuring that the water is free enough of bacteria and other pathogens that it can be returned to the water table. This output is supplemented by separate, large cisterns to capture rainwater for drinking.\nMany other details incorporated into the center also promote health, as well as comfort, beauty and pride. Above the reactors, for example, is a pavilion structure designed to maximize airflow. Rather than spending money on tents, furniture or waste disposal services \xe2\x80\x94 money that leaves the local economy \xe2\x80\x94 the organizations enlisted local artisans, whose metalwork is world renowned, to create perforated metal sheets, painted a chorus of blues, to wrap the building exterior. Waffle-like patterns of these sheets can be opened and closed to provide shade and privacy, or sealed completely during storms, as they were when Hurricane Irma neared Port-au-Prince last week.\nThe airflow is aided by large-diameter fans, like those in gyms and airports. The cement floor is smooth, free of crevices where bacteria can congregate, and sealed with epoxy. MASS Design interviewed many patients and staff members in an effort to design and create prototypes of beds that would be comfortable as well as easily sanitized and reused.\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat I love about MASS is their attention to detail,\xe2\x80\x9d Pape said. \xe2\x80\x9cThey asked us everything that work and everything that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t work. But most importantly, they are problem solvers.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe building looks absolutely extraordinary,\xe2\x80\x9d said Roger Glass, a cholera expert who is director of the Fogarty International Center for Advancing Science for Global Health at the National Institutes of Health and has visited the Gheskio campus. \xe2\x80\x9cFor ventilation and coolness, it\xe2\x80\x99s tremendous.\xe2\x80\x9d\nBefore encountering a hospital that MASS Design developed in Rwanda, Glass said, he had not seriously considered the relationship between health outcomes and building design. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you had called me seven years ago to talk about buildings and health, I would have blown you off,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. Today, Glass is eager to see more collaborations with human-centered design firms, like MASS Design, in the field of global health.\nComparing the treatment center to the tents, Pape is blunt: \xe2\x80\x9cIt was like going from hell to paradise.\xe2\x80\x9d\nAmie Shao, who helped lead MASS Design\xe2\x80\x99s work in Haiti, reflected: \xe2\x80\x9cWhen we started, our goal was simply to help Gheskio do their work better in treating their patients in a more dignified setting. We realized, however, that architecture could not only help treat these diseases after the fact, but prevent the spread of disease in the first place by controlling recontamination. In all of our work, we seek to proactively challenge many of the underlying risks and issues that global health faces.\xe2\x80\x9d\nTo be sure, the cholera treatment center is not solely responsible for halting the spread in Gheskio\xe2\x80\x99s target area. Gheskio also developed a robust water chlorination program and maintains its own factory to produce chlorine. The organization also supports and participates in broad efforts by the Ministry of Health to raise public awareness about symptoms and the risk of contamination throughout the country.\nAnd Gheskio joined forces with Partners in Health to get cholera vaccines approved in Haiti. Euvichol, a vaccine that can be administered orally and lasts up to 30 days without refrigeration, costs less than $2 per dose. \xe2\x80\x9cWe would need a budget of less than $50 million for universal coverage for all of Haiti,\xe2\x80\x9d Pape estimates.\nGheskio\xe2\x80\x99s Cholera Treatment Center was ultimately built for $750,000. Pape now predicts that the organization will have recouped that cost in just three years. Haiti needs a modern, countrywide water and sanitation system, but it\xe2\x80\x99s unclear where the money will come from. In the meantime, Gheskio\xe2\x80\x99s center has saved many lives.\nBy uniquely combining patient care with on-site water treatment, Gheskio\xe2\x80\x99s center also holds lessons for other regions struggling to contain cholera or facing it in the future. Globally, the World Health Organization estimates there are between 1.3 million and four million cases of cholera annually in 42 countries, with 21,000 to 143,000 cholera-related deaths each year. This year, Somalia saw a major resurgence of the disease, with over 50,000 people infected. About 1,000 died.\nIn the three years since Gheskio\xe2\x80\x99s Cholera Treatment Center opened, the facility has remained in constant use because those outside the organization\xe2\x80\x99s target area continue to be exposed to contaminated water. It has admitted over 10,000 patients to date, including over 7,000 who were hospitalized. Eighty-three percent of those patients came from outside of Gheskio\xe2\x80\x99s catchment area.\nWhile cholera reports in Haiti were on the rise in 2015 and 2016 at upward of 25,000 cases annually, the country saw a decrease in 2017, which Pape attributes to higher-than-normal rainfall in the region. Of the 100 beds, no more than a third were occupied at any time this year, with as few as a handful of patients at times. The risk for outbreaks remains high, however, and the disease\xe2\x80\x99s countrywide eradication is still years away.\n\xe2\x80\x9cHaiti\xe2\x80\x99s recently elected government, and the president particular, is focused on universal oral cholera vaccine as well as home chlorination,\xe2\x80\x9d Pape reports. \xe2\x80\x9cIf we get the vaccines and if we pursue home chlorination, I truly believe we can rid of cholera within four to five years.\xe2\x80\x9d\n'

aS'Is it permissible to take a selfie in front of the Kaaba during hajj? With spotty internet, I was unable to Google the answer. Forced to call an audible fatwa, I decided, \xe2\x80\x9cYes, if indeed my intention is pure.\xe2\x80\x9d\nFourteen hundred years ago, the Prophet Muhammad and his companions definitely didn\xe2\x80\x99t have to decide between Clarendon and Gingham filters to document the hajj pilgrimage that is recreated by Muslims each year. But then again, they didn\xe2\x80\x99t have Instagram as I did when I went to Mecca to satisfy the pillar of my faith during the last days of August and the beginning of September. They didn\xe2\x80\x99t have access to the air-conditioned tents that I used for shelter. And when they gazed at the Kaaba \xe2\x80\x94 the austere black cube that represents God\xe2\x80\x99s house on earth \xe2\x80\x94 it certainly wasn\xe2\x80\x99t dwarfed, as it is now, by \n that the Saudi government added to the landscape in 2012.\nAwe-struck by the privilege of participating in this tradition while often agitated by the contradictions that surround it today, I made sense of the experience by sharing it \xe2\x80\x94 filtering the pilgrimage through the lens of my smartphone.\nThe most painful aspect of hajj wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the physical toll that came with navigating cramped space with my two million diverse fellow pilgrims, or the intense spiritual concentration. It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the hiking-induced blisters and chafing. It was witnessing the erasure and razing of my religion\xe2\x80\x99s culture, history and narrative by the House of Saud.\nThe Saudi royal family follows the revisionist and extreme ideology of Wahhabism, which preaches an interpretation of strict monotheism that is often at odds with centuries of theological scholarship. They consider veneration and respect of most holy sites and visitations of graves as a form of idolatry.\nThat explains why, in their country, while the Prophet Muhammad\xe2\x80\x99s mosque and courtyard in Medina are spacious, cooled and immaculate, Jannat al-Baqi \xe2\x80\x94 a graveyard directly across from the green dome housing the remains of thousands of Islam\xe2\x80\x99s luminaries \xe2\x80\x94 looks like a set from \xe2\x80\x9cMad Max: Fury Road.\xe2\x80\x9d There are no tombstones, just slabs of rock sticking out like middle fingers from the dirt. If you linger too long to pay respects or offer a prayer, the mutawwa \xe2\x80\x94 religious police \xe2\x80\x94 rush you along. When you ask them who\xe2\x80\x99s buried here, they answer, \xe2\x80\x9cAllah knows best,\xe2\x80\x9d although they know the truth: the daughter of the prophet, his family members and some of his most loyal companions.\nMy friends and I spent hours at the prophet\xe2\x80\x99s tomb and the rawdah \xe2\x80\x94 a space between his original pulpit and grave considered by Muslims to be some of the hottest spiritual real estate on earth. The moving experience was tempered by the awareness that most Muslims long to offer their \xe2\x80\x9csalaams\xe2\x80\x9d (prayers of peace) to the prophet, but cannot afford to visit his mosque. Also, women are often unable to properly perform the \xe2\x80\x9cziyarat\xe2\x80\x9d (religious visitation) there because they\xe2\x80\x99re allowed only limited access.\nIn Mecca, I hiked nearly an hour under the remorseless afternoon sun to visit the Cave of Hira, where the prophet is believed to have received his first revelation: \xe2\x80\x9cRecite!\xe2\x80\x9d There are no golden signs, air-conditioning, wheelchair ramps or video presentations here. The austere cave used to offer a clear line of sight to the Kaaba, but now the view is now obscured by that monstrous, $15 billion, Saudi-government-funded clock tower and the accompanying world\xe2\x80\x99s tallest hotel.\nThat tableau is a perfect symbol of the strained marriage between the house of God \xe2\x80\x94 the Kaaba, in Mecca \xe2\x80\x94 and the House of Saud, which controls everything related to the sacred mosques. In adherence to the reactionary religious ideology it embraces, the government has allowed the prophet\xe2\x80\x99s house to fall into decrepitude. It has flattened the home of his first wife, Khadija, and installed public toilets where it used to stand. But it has no objection to the construction of extravagant hotels not far away.\nThese government\xe2\x80\x99s conflicting values were on display wherever I looked: While non-Muslims are forbidden from even entering Mecca, everyone is free to eat American Hardee\xe2\x80\x99s hamburgers or KFC fried chicken, or buy a Rolex watch across from the Kaaba. It\xe2\x80\x99s forbidden to excessively venerate the prophet and his companions, but there\xe2\x80\x99s no problem with the giant posters of King Abdulaziz, King Salman and his son, Crown Prince Muhammad bin Salman, that are all around town.\nBut whenever I found myself lamenting the ugliness and hypocrisy of these elements of my journey, the people I met reminded me why I was there, with displays of untarnished spirituality. In the prophet\xe2\x80\x99s mosque, local people brought bread, dates and milk to feed fasting pilgrims. Children begged me to eat from the plates they had prepared, hoping to gain some of the blessings. In the desert plain of Arafat, east of Mecca, I walked with nearly two million pilgrims to the Mount of Mercy. Men and women offered whatever they had: water, food, ice cream, a helping hand for a wheelchair-user. They shared the shade under their umbrellas, and sometimes even the clothes off their back with fellow pilgrims. We were united in a shared journey: seeking to find forgiveness, mercy and salvation.\nIt made sense to invite fellow Muslims and friends along for a view of this often-schizophrenic experience, unfiltered through Wahhabi propaganda. While I initially worried it might distract me from my prayer, sharing the photos and Facebook Live videos made hajj a communal experience, in the most modern way possible.\nIn Mecca and Medina, often through my camera\xe2\x80\x99s lens, I looked up at the heavens and at the shiny buildings, but I also looked around me and engaged with a community of believers \xe2\x80\x94 some of them with me on ground, and some of them looking at screens on the other side of the world. That\xe2\x80\x99s where I found God \xe2\x80\x94 and beauty \xe2\x80\x94 in all its glorious contradictions.\n'

aS'Last week, Americans woke up to news of yet another mass breach of their personal data. The consumer credit reporting agency Equifax revealed that \n, dates of birth, names and addresses may have been stolen from its files \xe2\x80\x94 just the kind of information that allows for identity theft and other cybercrimes.\nI don\xe2\x80\x99t know about you, but I\xe2\x80\x99ve lost count of the number of times in recent years that I\xe2\x80\x99ve been informed by a corporation of such a breach. \xe2\x80\x9cWe regret to inform you \xe2\x80\xa6.\xe2\x80\x9d I don\xe2\x80\x99t doubt that companies regret these things, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t think they care that much either. To them it means just a few days of bad press and at most a fine that amounts to a minuscule portion of their profits. With penalties like that, why would companies bother to make things better?\nThere are technical factors that explain why cybersecurity is so weak, but the underlying reason is political, and it\xe2\x80\x99s pretty simple: Big corporations have poured large amounts of money into our political system, helping to create a regulatory environment in which consumers shoulder more and more of the risk, and companies less and less.\nThis is a general feature of our lopsided world, but software businesses (and the technology sides of other companies) have acquired perhaps the greatest degree of impunity. Information technology arrived on the scene only recently, so it has faced fewer of the kinds of regulations that consumers and citizens, in more progressive eras, managed to impose on other industries.\nToday, almost every piece of software comes with a disclaimer on its user license that basically says that the product may not work as intended and that its maker may stop supporting it at any time, and that\xe2\x80\x99s the user\xe2\x80\x99s problem. It\xe2\x80\x99s a wonder companies don\xe2\x80\x99t insert \xe2\x80\x9cnyah nyah nyah nyah\xe2\x80\x9d into the tiny-print legalese.\nDon\xe2\x80\x99t get me wrong: I\xe2\x80\x99m a former programmer; I\xe2\x80\x99m not unsympathetic to the needs of software developers. Some number of unexpected errors \xe2\x80\x94 bugs \xe2\x80\x94 are unavoidable in computer programs. It would be unreasonable to allow a consumer to sue a software company every time a program suffered a glitch.\nBut the situation was different when the industry was younger and wasn\xe2\x80\x99t rolling in billions of dollars, as it is now. Most software failures and data breaches aren\xe2\x80\x99t inevitable; they are a result of neglect and underinvestment in product reliability and security.\nNo software system can be free from bugs (or intruders), and users must be mindful of the risks. But the inherent lack of perfect automotive safety doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean we don\xe2\x80\x99t try to make cars safer. Obviously, people should drive more carefully, but seatbelts, airbags and better car design reduce injury enormously, and that has been great for the industry as well as consumers. The software industry should be no different.\nPerhaps the most maddening part of the Equifax breach is that the credit-rating industry is itself unforgiving in its approach to even the smallest error. I\xe2\x80\x99m still dealing with the damage to my credit rating that resulted when I forgot to return a library book and a collection agency was called in (for a paltry sum). The Equifax executives who let my data be stolen will probably suffer fewer consequences than I will for an overdue library book. Even if they do get fired, it is likely that they will be sent off with millions of dollars in severance, which is common practice for executives. (I would like to note that I am available for such punishment any time.)\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve taught at a wide range of universities. I\xe2\x80\x99ve found that institutions serving less-advantaged students tend to have less-forgiving policies for late papers, missed exams, casual drug use and so forth, whereas more elite institutions tend to be more forgiving.

aS'MELBOURNE, Australia \xe2\x80\x94 Nothing prepares you for your first sight of Uluru. Amid the vastness of Australia\xe2\x80\x99s arid red center, there is something wondrous about this monumental slab of sandstone rising dramatically out of a flattened landscape. It is not difficult to see why Indigenous Australians saw it as a sacred place.\nUluru is not just a place of wonder and reverence. It has become, too, a political and historical battleground, a place through which Australia has tried to grapple with its relationship with Indigenous Australians.\nIt was the Anangu, the original inhabitants of the region, who gave Uluru its name. For more than a century, though, it was known to Australians of European descent as Ayers Rock, named after a 19th-century Anglo-Australian colonial administrator.\nIn 1985, as part of a process of reconciliation with Indigenous Australians, who had been brutally dispossessed of their lands, the government in Canberra both acknowledged the original name and returned ownership of Uluru to the Anangu, on condition that it be leased back to the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service. Some white Australians considered the restoration of ownership unnecessary; many Indigenous people thought it insufficient. Uluru came to symbolize the struggle for Indigenous rights and the meaning of Australian identity.\nAnd it was symbolically at Uluru that in May this year the \n met. It was part of an official process to discuss amending the Australian Constitution to give formal recognition to Indigenous peoples. The resulting \n called for the creation of a constitutionally enshrined voice for Indigenous peoples and a commission both to supervise \xe2\x80\x9cagreement-making\xe2\x80\x9d between the government and Indigenous peoples and to enable \xe2\x80\x9ctruth-telling\xe2\x80\x9d about the past. The government has yet to decide whether to put these constitutional changes to a referendum.\nThe demand for recognition and a distinct Indigenous voice emerges, in part, from the historical denial of both. Eighteenth-century British colonizers created the myth of the \xe2\x80\x9cterra nullius,\xe2\x80\x9d the empty land, to deny the presence of people who had inhabited it \n. When Indigenous groups fought to protect their lands, colonists \n. Those who survived the massacres were turned into nonpersons; until 1967, the Constitution \n of \xe2\x80\x9caboriginal natives\xe2\x80\x9d for the census, erasing them from the public record.\nThis history was for a long time suppressed in Australian memory. Not till the 1980s did scholars such as Henry Reynolds and Lyndall Ryan \n. This led to the so-called history wars of the 1990s and 2000s. Conservative historians like Keith Windschuttle dismissed the critical, revisionist accounts of what became known as the \xe2\x80\x9cblack armband\xe2\x80\x9d view of history and attempted to maintain the old story of Australia.\nThe conservatives largely lost the debate. Today, for instance, every public event, whether an academic conference or a sporting match, is preceded by an acknowledgment of the traditional owners and of the land on which the event is taking place.\nYet for all the acknowledgment of the past, the material disadvantage suffered in the present remains untouched. \n for Indigenous Australians is 10 years less than for the non-Indigenous population. The unemployment rate is nearly four times higher; the \n more than twice so. Indigenous Australians \n at a higher rate than any other group on earth, making up 3 percent of the Australian population but \n.\nWhatever becomes of the Uluru Statement, constitutional recognition is unlikely to change any of this.\nThe debate about Indigenous peoples seems \xe2\x80\x94 at least to me, an outsider \xe2\x80\x94 to take place on only two registers: on one hand, silence; on the other, a romanticization of Indigenous life.\nIt may seem odd to speak of silence in a nation where the issue of Indigenous rights is so prominent in public life. But silence can come in many forms. The affirmation of Indigenous ownership at public events has become little more than a ritual incantation that allows white Australians to assuage guilt without taking the action necessary to challenge racist marginalization.\nEqually troubling is the romanticization. It has become the accepted truth that Indigenous peoples have a culture stretching back 65,000 years. Humans have been on the continent for that long, but no culture extends over such a time span. Today\xe2\x80\x99s Indigenous Australians no more have the same relationship to the spiritual tradition of Dreamtime stories as did those first inhabitants than modern Greeks relate to \xe2\x80\x9cThe Iliad\xe2\x80\x9d in the way their ancient forebears did.\nThe idea of an unbroken, unchanged culture has a flip side that has always animated racists. It was once used to portray Indigenous Australians, and other nonwhite races, as primitive and incapable of development. Likewise with another common claim: that Indigenous people have a special attachment to the land and a unique form of ecological wisdom. This, too, draws on an old racist trope, a reworking of the \xe2\x80\x9cnoble savage\xe2\x80\x9d myth. The fact that in contemporary debates such ideas are deployed in support, rather than denial, of Indigenous rights does not make them more palatable.\nWhen I raised these issues with Australian academics and activists, many suggested that as someone with a European perspective, I did not grasp the nuances of the Australian debate. That may be true. But many of the issues are global, not local. From America to South Africa, from India to France, questions about the legacies of colonialism, the authenticity of cultural traditions and the meaning of democracy in pluralist societies dominate public debate.\nIt was fascinating to read an \n, one of the guiding lights of the Uluru Statement, in which he references the work of Edmund Burke and Johann Herder to buttress his arguments: two 18th-century European philosophers, the first a founder of modern conservatism, the second of the Romantic view of culture. Both are figures whose ideas are central to European debates about multiculturalism, tradition and recognition \xe2\x80\x94 common threads that run through the discussions in different continents.\nI was struck, also, by the fact that the Uluru delegates had not been elected by their communities but invited by the organizers. In Europe, the demand for recognition for minority communities has often helped empower community leaders at the expense of the communities themselves. It would be a tragedy if this were to happen in Australia, too.\n'

aS'These days, many of us would rather not be living in the present, a time of persistent crisis, political uncertainty and fear. Not that the future looks better, shadowed by technological advances that threaten widespread unemployment and by the perils of catastrophic climate change. No wonder some are tempted by the comforts of a nostalgically imagined past.\nInspiring as it seems on first inspection, the self-help slogan \xe2\x80\x9clive in the present\xe2\x80\x9d slips rapidly out of focus. What would living in the present mean? To live each day as if it were your last, without a thought for the future, is simply bad advice, a recipe for recklessness. The idea that one can make oneself invulnerable to what happens by detaching from everything but the present is an irresponsible delusion.\nDespite this, there is an interpretation of living in the present, inspired by Aristotle, that can help us to confront the present crisis and the perpetual crises of struggle and failure in life. There is an insight in the self-help slogan that philosophy can redeem.\nThe beginning of wisdom here is to think about what we are doing. We engage in all sorts of activities: reading an article in the newspaper, reflecting on life, attending a protest, preparing a report, listening to music, driving home, making dinner, spending time with family or friends. Though all these activities take time, there is a crucial difference in how they relate to the present moment.\nUsing terminology from linguistics, we can distinguish activities of two fundamental kinds. Telic activities \xe2\x80\x94 from \xe2\x80\x9ctelos,\xe2\x80\x9d the Greek word for purpose \xe2\x80\x94 aim at terminal states, by which they are completed. Think of reading this article or driving home from work. Once you arrive at the goal, you are finished: The point of the activity has been achieved. You can do it again, but only by way of repetition. Not all activities are like this. Some activities are atelic: They do not aim at terminal states. However much you reflect on life or spend time with your family, you cannot complete these activities. Though you will eventually stop doing them, they do not aim at a point at which there is no more of them to do.\nAristotle made the same distinction, contrasting two kinds of action or praxis: kinesis and energeia. Kinetic actions are telic and therefore incomplete. As Aristotle wrote in his \xe2\x80\x9cMetaphysics\xe2\x80\x9d: \xe2\x80\x9cIf you are learning, you have not at the same time learned.\xe2\x80\x9d When you care about telic activities, projects such as writing a report, getting married or making dinner, satisfaction is always in the future or the past. It is yet to be achieved and then it is gone. Telic activities are exhaustible; in fact, they aim at their own exhaustion. They thus exhibit a peculiar self-subversion. In valuing and so pursuing these activities, we aim to complete them, and so to expel them from our lives.\nAtelic activities, by contrast, do not by nature come to an end and are not incomplete. In defining such activities, we could emphasize their inexhaustibility, the fact that they do not aim at terminal states. But we could also emphasize what Aristotle does: They are fully realized in the present. \xe2\x80\x9cAt the same time, one is seeing and has seen, is understanding and has understood, is thinking and has thought.\xe2\x80\x9d There is nothing you need to do in order to perform an atelic activity except what you are doing right now. If what you care about is reflecting on your life or spending time with family or friends, and that is what you are doing, you are not on the way to achieving your end: You are already there.\nWhat would it mean, then, to live in the present, and what do we gain by doing it?\nTo live in the present is to appreciate the value of atelic activities like going for a walk, listening to music, spending time with family or friends. To engage in these activities is not to extinguish them from your life. Their value is not mortgaged to the future or consigned to the past, but realized here and now. It is to care about the process of what you are doing, not just projects you aim to complete.\nThe advice is easy to misread. To live in the present is not to deny the value of telic activities, of making a difference in the world. That would be a terrible mistake. Nor can we avoid engaging in such activities. But if projects are all we value, our lives become self-subversive, aimed at extinguishing the sources of meaning within them. To live in the present is to refuse the excessive investment in projects, in achievements and results, that sees no inherent value in the process.\nTo live in the present is not to avoid hard work or strife. Alongside the projects that occupy you in your profession, or in your political life, the telic activities that matter to you, is the atelic process of protesting injustice or doing your job. To value the process is not to flee from work or political engagement. That is why living in the present is not an abdication of ethical responsibility or a recipe for detachment.\nTo focus on the telic is to focus, all too often, on the distance and precariousness of our goals: to provide health care for all, to halt the resurgence of white supremacy, to limit global warming to 2 degrees. Consequences matter, as do activities that aim at them. The point of political protest is to change the world. And yet the process matters, too. The value of standing up for what is right, of going on strike or marching in the streets, is not exhausted by the value of its effects. It is not wholly erased by failure. We protest in part because we see no better way to make a difference, in part to make the present count for something, whatever the future holds.\n'

aS'Dublin \xe2\x80\x94 Shortly after midnight on Nov. 2, 1950, when the Cold War was well underway, all the illuminated signs on Broadway and Times Square were dimmed in salute to the most prominent Western admirer of Stalin. The Irish dramatist George Bernard Shaw had just died, and the tribute reflected the fame of plays such as \xe2\x80\x9cPygmalion,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cMan and Superman\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cSaint Joan.\xe2\x80\x9d\nBut Shaw\xe2\x80\x99s plays were nothing if not political, and few of his American admirers could have been in doubt that his politics included support for Communism in general and for Stalin in particular. That he was nonetheless honored in the United States is a reminder that the great divide of the Cold War was never as simple as it seemed. Beneath Shaw\xe2\x80\x99s infatuation with Stalin, moreover, was a force that is still with us: a desire to see in Russia all the qualities that the Western democracies lack.\nOn the face of it, Shaw\xe2\x80\x99s idolization of Stalin is a great puzzle. The man known around the world by his initials G.B.S. was not just a great playwright; he was arguably the single most influential public intellectual of the first half of the 20th century. At Shaw\xe2\x80\x99s death, Jawaharlal Nehru, the first prime minister of independent India, said, \xe2\x80\x9cHe was not only one of the greatest figures of his age, but one who influenced the thought of vast numbers of human beings during two generations.\xe2\x80\x9d\nThat influence could be summed up in one bracing imperative: the duty to be a skeptic. He challenged his readers and audiences to burst bubbles of conventional wisdom on almost every issue imaginable, from the rightful place of women to the pretensions of empires, from the glory of war to the treatment of animals, from homosexuality to children\xe2\x80\x99s rights, from religious doctrine to the treatment of the poor. When Shaw\xe2\x80\x99s demolitions of received ideas provoked outrage and obloquy, he courageously defended his intellectual independence. He abhorred cruelty and made mincemeat of propaganda.\nAnd yet, he was devoted to one of the cruelest figures in the bloody annals of tyranny, and he was a willing dupe of the propaganda that projected the Soviet Union as a workers\xe2\x80\x99 paradise. The great skeptic allowed all his skepticism to melt away when he looked at the picture of Stalin he kept by his mantelpiece.\nHis support was unwavering. Neither the Great Purge nor the Ukrainian famine, nor even the pact between Stalin and Hitler, seem to have troubled his faith in the genius and historic rectitude of the Soviet dictator. To understand this contradiction, we have to remember the power of wish fulfillment and the way Russia became for many Westerners not a place but an idea, not a mere reality but a fantasy.\nIn part, Shaw\xe2\x80\x99s inability to challenge the myth of Stalin as a great friend of humanity can be explained by flattery. When he visited the Soviet Union in 1931 (accompanied by the American-born Conservative member of Parliament Nancy Astor), he was greeted in Moscow by a military guard of honor, banners emblazoned with his portrait and crowds crying, \xe2\x80\x9cHail, Shaw!\xe2\x80\x9d An enormous banquet was held to celebrate Shaw\xe2\x80\x99s 75th birthday. And Stalin himself granted Shaw a two-hour-long private audience at which his guest found the dictator in \xe2\x80\x9ccharmingly good-humored\xe2\x80\x9d mood.\nIn part, too, Shaw\xe2\x80\x99s insistence on seeing the Soviet Union as the harbinger of the great socialist utopia can be explained by the disappointments of democracy. He had fought for decades to establish universal adult suffrage, especially for women and the working class. Like many radical intellectuals, he was dismayed to find that many of these new voters preferred king-and-country conservatism to the socialism they were supposed to support. Especially as the Great Depression took hold, parliaments and political parties seemed utterly ineffectual. Stalin\xe2\x80\x99s apparent ability to move mountains and transform society with triumphant five-year plans offered an antidote to his impatience with the frustrations of democracy.\nBut underlying all of this, there was an even stronger impulse: the fantasy of Russia itself. Long before the Bolshevik Revolution gave the dream a very particular political content, Shaw was primed to expect a global spiritual resurrection that would begin in Russia. This hope was not as fanciful as it may now seem: In the late 19th century, when Shaw\xe2\x80\x99s political and artistic consciousness was being formed, Russian music, drama and literature were at the leading edge of modern Western culture. As he later wrote to Maxim Gorky, \xe2\x80\x9cI myself am as strongly susceptible as anyone to the fascination of the Russian character as expressed by its art and personally by its artists.\xe2\x80\x9d\nThe creation of G.B.S. owes almost as much to Russia as it does to Ireland or England. He learned much of his political style from anti-czarist exiles in London, especially the anarchist Peter Kropotkin and the nihilist Sergius Stepniak. Arguably Shaw\xe2\x80\x99s greatest play, \xe2\x80\x9cHeartbreak House,\xe2\x80\x9d is subtitled \xe2\x80\x9cA Fantasia in the Russian Manner on English Themes\xe2\x80\x9d and was greatly influenced by Chekhov.\nAbove all, Shaw was caught up in the great wave of enthusiasm for Tolstoy that broke over the English-speaking world in the mid-1880s when \xe2\x80\x9cWar and Peace,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cAnna Karenina\xe2\x80\x9d and most of his other works appeared in translation. Shaw called Tolstoy \xe2\x80\x9cthe master.\xe2\x80\x9d His own insistence on the didactic purpose of art and his forging of a sage-like persona are pure Tolstoy.\nThis was not just a matter of artistic influence. Russia became, for Shaw, a kind of alternate universe, an imaginative field in which grandiosities that he would otherwise have delighted in puncturing were given free rein. He would have made devastating fun of anyone writing about \xe2\x80\x9cthe Irish soul,\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cthe English soul,\xe2\x80\x9d but he was happy to write without irony of \xe2\x80\x9cthe soul of the Russian people.\xe2\x80\x9d When Kropotkin\xe2\x80\x99s daughter told him that \xe2\x80\x9cthe Russians would give the world back its lost soul,\xe2\x80\x9d Shaw did not scoff. Rather, as he wrote to Gorky, \xe2\x80\x9cI quite understand that; it is not at all ridiculous to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\nIt was, of course, Marx who wrote that everything in history happens twice, \xe2\x80\x9cthe first time as tragedy, the second time as farce.\xe2\x80\x9d There is something tragic in Shaw\xe2\x80\x99s journey from Tolstoy to Stalin, from seeing Russia as the place to give the world back its lost soul to his eventual embrace of the Soviet project as \xe2\x80\x9cthe only hope of the world.\xe2\x80\x9d But perhaps this same impulse is now with us \xe2\x80\x94 in full-on farcical mode.\nVladimir Putin is no Stalin, and the white nationalists around Donald Trump are certainly no Shaws. But some of the same impulse is still at work: the tendency to fantasize about Russia as the vigorous counterweight to a supposedly decadent West. There is the same impatience with the messiness and inefficiency of democracy, and it leads to the same crush on the strongman leader who can cut through the irrelevant natterings of parliaments and parties.\nShaw\xe2\x80\x99s infatuation with Russia became a full-on love affair with a Soviet autocrat, whereas the Trump bromance with President Putin appears unconsummated. But they share a fatal attraction that both preceded and survived the Soviet Union: the allure of a faraway place where the great leader is obeyed because he embodies a people\xe2\x80\x99s soul.\n'

aS'The violent furor that erupted this summer over the removal of Confederate monuments in several cities was a stark reminder that Americans remain trapped in the residue of slavery and racial violence. In confronting this difficult truth, our attention is naturally drawn to the South. And rightfully so: The South was the hotbed of race-based labor and sexual exploitation before and after the Civil War, and the caldron of a white supremacist ideology that sought to draw an inviolable line between whiteness and blackness, purity and contagion, precious lives and throwaway lives. As the author of three histories on slavery and race in the South, I agree that removing Confederate iconography from cities like New Orleans, Baltimore and Charlottesville, Va., is necessary and urgent.\nHowever, in our national discourse on slavery\xe2\x80\x99s legacy and racism\xe2\x80\x99s persistent grip, we have overlooked a crucial fact: Our history of human bondage and white supremacy is not restricted to the South.\nBy turning the South into an island of historical injustice separate from the rest of the United States, we misunderstand the longstanding nationwide collusion that has produced white supremacist organizers in Fargo, N.D., and a president from New York City who thinks further research is needed to determine the aims of the Ku Klux Klan. Historians of the United States are continually unearthing an ugly truth: American slavery had no bounds. It penetrated every corner of this country, materially, economically and ideologically, and the unjust campaign to preserve it is embedded in our built environments, North and South, East and West. Detroit is a surprising case in point.\nDetroit\xe2\x80\x99s legacy is one of a \xe2\x80\x9cfree\xe2\x80\x9d city, a final stop on the Underground Railroad before Canada, known by the code word \xe2\x80\x9cMidnight.\xe2\x80\x9d Yet its early history is mired in a slave past. Near the start of the Revolutionary War, William and Alexander Macomb, Scots-Irish traders from New York, illegally purchased Grosse Isle from the Potawatomi people. William Macomb was the largest slaveholder in Detroit in the late 1700s. He owned at least 26 black men, women and children. He kept slaves on his Detroit River islands, which included Belle Isle (the current city park) and Grosse Isle, and right in the heart of the city, not far from where the International Underground Railroad Memorial now rises above the river view. When Macomb died, his wife, Sarah, and their sons inherited the family fortune, later becoming \xe2\x80\x94 along with other Detroit slaveholding families \xe2\x80\x94 among the first trustees of the University of Michigan.\nThe Macomb surname and those of numerous Detroit slave sellers, slaveholders and indigenous-land thieves cover the region\xe2\x80\x99s map. Men who committed crimes against humanity in their fur trade shops and private homes, on their farms, islands and Great Lakes trading vessels, are memorialized throughout the metropolis, on street signs, school buildings, town halls and county seats. The Detroit journalist Bill McGraw began a catalog of these names in his 2012 article \xe2\x80\x9c\n\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 Macomb, Campau, Beaubien, McDougall, Abbott, Brush, Cass, Hamtramck, Gouin, Meldrum, Dequindre, Beaufait, Groesbeck, Livernois, Rivard. And that\xe2\x80\x99s just a start.\nBelle Isle, for instance, was named for Isabelle Cass, a daughter of Lewis Cass, a Detroit politician and governor of Michigan in the early 1800s. Lewis Cass, a supporter of slavery, negotiated the sale of a woman he had enslaved named Sally to a member of the Macomb family in 1818, according to his biographer, Willard Carl Klunder. The Cass family name is attached to a county in Michigan as well as one of Detroit\xe2\x80\x99s best public schools, Cass Tech. Detroiters and visitors alike speak and elevate the names of these slaveholders whenever they trace their fingers across a map or walk the streets in search of the nearest Starbucks.\nDetroit is just one example of the hidden historical maps that silently shape our sense of place and community. Place names, submerged below our immediate awareness, may make us feel that slavery and racial oppression have faded into the backdrops of cities, and our history. Yet they do their cultural and political work.\nThe embedded racism of our streetscapes and landscapes is made perhaps more dangerous because we cannot see it upon a first glance. In Detroit and across the country, slaveholder names plastered about commemorate a social order in which elite white people exerted inexorable power over black and indigenous bodies and lives. Places named after slaveholders who sold people, raped people, chained people, beat people and orchestrated sexual pairings to further their financial ends slip off our tongues without pause or forethought. Yet these memory maps make up what the University of Michigan historian Matthew Countryman has called \xe2\x80\x9cmoral maps\xe2\x80\x9d of the places that we inhabit together.\nIt is our duty to confront our ugly history in whole cloth. Confederate monuments in the South, in all of their artistic barbarity and weighty symbolism, are but one kind of commemoration of slavery and white power among many that shape our everyday environments, influence our collective identities and silently signal what our national culture validates. While the past does not change, our interpretations of it as we gain new evidence and insight can and should. Collectively determining what we valorize in the public square is the responsibility of the people who live in these stained places now. We can and must recover them.\n'

aS'When schools reopened in New York last week, students were greeted by teachers who had spent the summer preparing for their return. Unfortunately, many of those teachers had had to devote some of their time not to lesson plans, but to a state teacher-certification process that emphasizes bureaucratic procedures more than real-world qualifications.\nSo as a teacher who recently had to jump through the New York certification hoops, I was pleased to learn that the \n, which authorizes charter operators, \n to certify their teachers themselves. The comment period for the proposal closes on Monday, and the institute could approve it as early as next month.\nHere\xe2\x80\x99s my story. In February 2015, I was delighted to receive an offer from Democracy Prep Public Schools, one of New York City\xe2\x80\x99s thriving charter school networks, to join an innovative new educational program for students with disabilities called Pathways. There was just one problem: I was not certified to teach in New York State.\nThat I did not possess the requisite certification did not mean that I lacked the requisite qualifications. When I received my offer from Democracy Prep, I had already spent six years of teaching and coaching aspiring teachers in Boston and Chicago. As a graduate of Boston Teacher Residency, an alternative teacher-preparation program based in Boston Public Schools, I am certified to teach in Massachusetts. I also have a master\xe2\x80\x99s in education from the University of Massachusetts, Boston.\nNevertheless, because of New York\xe2\x80\x99s approach to teacher credentialing, it took 18 months, three exams, one teaching portfolio, countless hours and about $1,000 for me to get my initial certificate through reciprocity.\nAnd I\xe2\x80\x99m one of the lucky ones. Because I was already certified in another state, I did not have to take additional graduate courses. Democracy Prep even reimbursed all of my application and exam fees. Still, I found myself having to divert precious time from my work in the classroom to study for exams and compile a teaching portfolio just to demonstrate that I was a competent teacher, which I had already proved six years before in Boston. It can be a daunting task, one that can deter great prospective teachers, or prompt already great teachers to leave the field rather than deal with the paperwork involved in getting certified in a new state or renewing their certification.\nEven as charter schools become more numerous and more popular, they are having problems finding enough instructors, and so they rely on young, new teachers, often from nontraditional backgrounds, who have yet to receive certification. Under the Charter School Institute proposal, schools would be able to design their own training programs and certify teachers. These new teachers would have to get a minimum of 100 hours of \xe2\x80\x9cfield experience\xe2\x80\x9d under the supervision of another teacher and 30 hours of \xe2\x80\x9ccontent core\xe2\x80\x9d instruction, among other requirements.\nMany charter schools, including Democracy Prep, are already in a position to undertake such programs. By mid-August of this year, I was headlong into summer professional development. Teachers at Democracy Prep engage in approximately 240 hours of training throughout the school year. I also receive constant feedback and support to improve my teaching practice and help students grow. I am observed weekly by school leaders, instructional coaches and other network staff members. At the end of each trimester, I sit down with my principal to review my performance and progress and to set goals for the remainder of the year.\nWhile some unions and professors at teachers colleges have criticized the certification proposal, my experiences in schools around this country have taught me that no one actually cares where or how you learned to teach. No one has ever walked into my classroom and asked to see my degree or questioned my qualifications; all that has mattered is the classroom environment that I\xe2\x80\x99ve helped to create, the relationships that I\xe2\x80\x99ve built with students and families, and the growth of my students.\nLimiting the ability of schools to attract great teachers makes little sense. It\xe2\x80\x99s not important to our students whether their teachers went through a traditional graduate school of education, Teach for America or a charter school training program; all that matters is that they get the very best teachers that we can give them. Our communities, schools and students deserve the highest-quality teachers, not merely the ones with a paper certificate.\n'

aS'DURHAM, N.C. \xe2\x80\x94 Of the 2,753 victims of the terrorist attack on the World Trade Center on Sept. 11, 2001, no physical trace has been found for 1,112 of them. Thus, for 40 percent of those who died that day, no remains have been returned to their families. In the aftermath of the carnage, some people exhibited photos, family snapshots, of those who had vanished and remained unaccounted for, despite the efforts of the authorities.\nWhat could be more natural than to seek information that would, at least, offer clarity and closure, surcease to the mind and heart? As long as there was no body to mourn, there was always a desperate shred of belief that perhaps the loved one might somehow have survived. Any bereavement is hard enough, but when someone has disappeared, seemingly annihilated from the face of the earth, it becomes unbearable.\nWhen I was growing up, I had always heard the Spanish verb \xe2\x80\x9cdesaparecer\xe2\x80\x9d used intransitively: \xe2\x80\x9cSe desapareci\xc3\xb3 mi libro,\xe2\x80\x9d my book disappeared somewhere, my mother or my father would say, as if it had somehow mislaid itself. Years later, after the Chilean military coup of Sept. 11, 1973, we learned a sinister new usage. Around 1974, like others who had gone into exile to escape the dictatorship, my wife and I began to hear a transitive version of the verb: \xe2\x80\x9clo desaparecieron\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cla desaparecieron,\xe2\x80\x9d they disappeared him or her.\n\xe2\x80\x9cDesaparecer\xe2\x80\x9d became a verb that, far from being passive, described a ferocious act of violence and dissimulation. Agents of the state were kidnapping opponents of the regime and then denying their relatives any knowledge of their whereabouts. The verb\xe2\x80\x99s new meaning was a response to a particularly cruel form of terror: Those in power were eliminating anyone they considered a threat while whitewashing their responsibility for the persecutions. The abductors wanted to spread fear \xe2\x80\x94 Will I be next? Will my son, my parents, my spouse? \xe2\x80\x94 and simultaneously claim there was no human rights abuse.\nBut this monstrous criminality incited its own form of resistance. The families, primarily the mothers, of the \xe2\x80\x9cdesaparecidos,\xe2\x80\x9d the disappeared, were not going to let their dear ones fade into the darkness. In the years that followed, the world witnessed how those relatives stood up to the authorities, demanding that the detained be returned alive or, if they had been murdered, that their bodies be released for a proper burial and commemoration. Emblematic of this resistance were the photos pinned to the dresses of women or held aloft on placards at rallies or silent marches that were often savagely repressed.\nThough such acts of defiance had their start in Chile and Argentina in the mid-1970s, they soon became globalized, as globalized as the terror they were protesting. Over the decades, families in Afghanistan and Myanmar, Ethiopia and Cyprus, to the more recent cases of Syria, Yemen and Mexico, adopted the same tactics, a determined attempt to memorialize the missing.\nIn time, it was not just the victims of political brutality who were, in some sense, kept fiercely alive in this way. In the 1980s, after our family had moved to the United States, we were surprised to see the images of youngsters on milk cartons, placed at the behest of parents whose children had disappeared. The context was very different \xe2\x80\x94 unlike in Chile, in America the police were allies in the search for the missing \xe2\x80\x94 but the impulse to call attention to the lost loved one was something we recognized with a shudder. We could identify with the pain felt by those families, the uncertainty and bewilderment corroding their existence.\nDespite the disparity in circumstances, the photos staring at consumers from peaceful milk cartons in the United States and the photos paraded by relatives of the desaparecidos who were beaten and jailed and persecuted for demanding justice, shared a very human trait. They wanted to make visible the face and fate of someone who could not speak for himself or herself, and to enlist the wider citizenry in a quest for the truth.\nIt is that communion across borders, a bond of grief between some of the most and least fortunate people in the world, that makes the idea of bearing witness to the disappeared powerful and universal, and especially relevant right now. At this crossroads in history, the disappearance that was inflicted on a sliver of the earth\xe2\x80\x99s population could now be perpetrated against all humanity, dragging into the void every other species as well. The very extinction of our world, whether by thermonuclear war or from unstoppable man-made climate change, is ominously possible.\nThe vanishing we face would apply not just to the billions breathing at this moment, but to those we remember and those yet to come. All of them, all of us, \xe2\x80\x9cdesaparecidos.\xe2\x80\x9d\nIn these circumstances, we should look to the families of the disappeared for guidance and courage. Despite the price they paid for struggling against indifference and fear, they refused to let death have the last word. Perhaps we, too, should pin to our clothes the photos of those most precious to us.\nIf we do not make visible all who would be perpetually disappeared, if we do not find the means to force the powerful to listen and reverse course, humanity will be engulfed in an apocalypse on an infinitely greater scale than the Sept. 11 attacks. Everything and everyone we love would be reduced to dust in a planet emptied of life and laughter, forever.\nBut we can still refuse to be disappeared. It starts by depriving disappearance of our complicity or resignation.\n'

aS'In September 2015, amid the Republican Party\xe2\x80\x99s fervid primary campaign, Ben Carson briefly outshone Donald Trump for nuttiness. The retired neurosurgeon (now the secretary of housing and urban development) \n in an interview that a Muslim should never be placed \xe2\x80\x9cin charge of this nation.\xe2\x80\x9d Liberals were horrified, and rightly so. Yet today liberals have their own tolerance blind spot, and Christians are most likely to get caught in it.\nWitness last week\xe2\x80\x99s Senate confirmation hearing for Amy Coney Barrett, a law professor at Notre Dame whom President Trump has nominated to serve on the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals. Going far beyond questions of legal philosophy and qualification, several Democratic lawmakers interrogated Ms. Barrett about her devout Catholicism, suggesting that her faith would impede her ability to serve as a judge.\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you consider yourself an \xe2\x80\x98orthodox Catholic\xe2\x80\x99?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Dick Durbin of Illinois, himself a Catholic, taking issue with Ms. Barrett\xe2\x80\x99s use of that term to describe those who strive to align their lives fully with the Church\xe2\x80\x99s teachings. Mazie Hirono of Hawaii darkly insinuated that Ms. Barrett would apply Catholic morality to decide cases.\nBut Dianne Feinstein of California took things furthest. \xe2\x80\x9cDogma and law are two different things,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd I think whatever a religion is, it has its own dogma. The law is totally different. And I think in your case, professor, when you read your speeches, the conclusion one draws is that the dogma lives loudly within you, and that\xe2\x80\x99s of concern.\xe2\x80\x9d\nThe notion that Catholics are so beholden to Rome as to be incapable of rendering independent judgment in public office has a long, sordid history. It was a mainstay of 19th-century nativist propaganda, and it would dog John F. Kennedy in the following century. Senator Feinstein \n exhibiting anti-Catholic bias. But as with other forms of racial or religious animus, one needn\xe2\x80\x99t always use an explicit epithet to arouse ugly emotions.\nWorse, these accusations were based on a mangled understanding of Ms. Barrett\xe2\x80\x99s work. In a 1998 \n that has been seized on by left-wing activists, Ms. Barrett and a co-author addressed how Catholic judges might deal with capital cases, given the church\xe2\x80\x99s opposition to the death penalty in virtually all situations. The same dilemma confronts liberal Protestants and many Jews, the authors noted. It could even trouble an atheist judge whose conscience tells her that capital punishment is wrong.\nThe authors concluded that recusal rules provide a way out, and they examined when and under what conditions judges should take advantage of them. But they concluded that \xe2\x80\x9cjudges cannot \xe2\x80\x94 nor should they try to \xe2\x80\x94 align our legal system with the Church\xe2\x80\x99s moral teaching whenever the two diverge.\xe2\x80\x9d The Senate wasn\xe2\x80\x99t dealing with a fanatic or theocrat in Ms. Barrett.\nThe episode was symptomatic of a repressive turn among Western liberals. Earlier this year, Senator Bernie Sanders railed against Russell Vought, whom President Trump has nominated as the deputy director of the Office of Management and Budget and who had once written that Muslims \xe2\x80\x9cstand condemned\xe2\x80\x9d for rejecting Jesus. This was indeed a crude way of putting Christian doctrine. It wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have been unreasonable for lawmakers to press Mr. Vought to ensure that he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t discriminate against Muslims while serving in government. But were Mr. Vought\xe2\x80\x99s comments disqualifying, as Senator Sanders argued? Taken to its logical conclusion, that would mean any strong expression of theological conviction is unwelcome in the public square. Orthodox Muslims \xe2\x80\x94 who hold the Quran to be God\xe2\x80\x99s final and fullest revelation, superseding Mosaic law and Christianity \xe2\x80\x94 wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t fare any better under the Sanders rule, if it were applied uniformly.\nSimilar sentiments are gathering strength in Britain, where I live. This week Jacob Rees-Mogg, a Catholic and a Tory member of Parliament, faced a torrent of abuse in the media \xe2\x80\x94 he was called a \xe2\x80\x9cbigot\xe2\x80\x9d and a \xe2\x80\x9creactionary\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 for explaining his anti-abortion views and opposition to same-sex marriage in a TV interview. A \n in The Times of London portrayed him as a man-fetus in utero, lamenting how his party-leadership hopes had been \xe2\x80\x9cterminated.\xe2\x80\x9d\nIn June, Britain\xe2\x80\x99s Liberal Democrats ousted their leader, Tim Farron, an evangelical Christian, over his personal views on homosexuality and abortion. This, even though as a matter of public policy, Mr. Farron supported abortion rights and gay marriage.\nAs a classical liberal and a recent convert to Catholicism, I find all of this deeply dismaying. Long before I started on my journey to Rome, I believed in the promise of the free society \xe2\x80\x94 a system in which liberty and tradition could contend without either one trying to destroy the other. One could be fully a believer and fully invested in a liberal constitutional order. But for some progressives, it isn\xe2\x80\x99t enough to have won most of the cultural and policy battles of the past several decades. Even the remnants of the other side, in people\xe2\x80\x99s minds and consciences, must submit to maximalist progressive claims.\nIt won\xe2\x80\x99t happen, and the desire to do so isn\xe2\x80\x99t actually liberal. It is, well, dogmatic. Not all dogmas involve Almighty God.\n'

aS'On Aug. 24, the Supreme Court of India, in a rare unanimous judgment, declared privacy a constitutional right.\nThe court unflinchingly reasoned that the rights to life and liberty of which privacy is a part protect the sanctity of the home and relationships like marriage, procreation and sexual orientation.\nIt is a ruling that will forever affect the social fabric of this country and reaffirm a constitutional morality in a time of deep social and political division \xe2\x80\x94 a judgment that can be equated with Brown v. Board of Education in the United States.\nThe ruling comes as the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party, which came to power in 2014, is attempting a cultural reconfiguration of Indian society \xe2\x80\x94 policing choices about food, gender roles, sexuality, marriage and religion. Such actions are at odds with the values of secularism, equality and dignity, and freedom of expression, conscience and religion that are enshrined in India\xe2\x80\x99s progressive Constitution of 1950. This troubling context makes the decision of the Supreme Court especially empowering.\nThe Supreme Court is also ground zero for challenges to the efforts of Prime Minister Narendra Modi\xe2\x80\x99s government to force all Indians to sign up for the biometric databank, called the Aadhar project, in which retina scans, fingerprints and demographic information is stored under 12-digit unique identification numbers. The privacy ruling was necessary since the constitutional status of privacy had to be established before the court adjudicated on various challenges to the Aadhar database that are still pending.\nThe government has mandated that Aadhar data be linked to citizens\xe2\x80\x99 information from bank accounts, tax filings, medical records and phone numbers. The government would have unregulated access to such information \xe2\x80\x94 and there is no statute to guard against abuse or to allow an individual to file a complaint.\nEssentially, under the Aadhar project, a citizen\xe2\x80\x99s data now belongs to the Indian government and not to the individual. There are fears that the project would endow the Indian government with enormous knowledge that could be deployed against minority communities and individuals who disagree with its politics and policies.\nTwenty-two petitioners have challenged the constitutionality of Aadhar. The lead petitioner, K. S. Puttaswamy, a 91-year-old retired judge, contested the requirement that people have an Aadhar number to obtain cooking gas and to purchase grains from the public distribution system.\nThe Aadhar case prompted the Supreme Court to assess whether Indians had privacy rights under their Constitution. Without a constitutional interest in privacy, there can be no right to protection of personal data. Now, with their jurisprudence on privacy, the justices have emerged as champions of personal liberties.\nJawaharlal Nehru, India\xe2\x80\x99s first prime minister and a leader in the struggle against British colonial rule, had spent substantial amounts of time in colonial courts and jails. As the Constituent Assembly of India was debating the making of the Constitution in the late 1940s, Nehru was skeptical about the role of the Supreme Court and feared that the judiciary would obstruct change.\nTo its credit, the Supreme Court of independent India became deeply invested in protecting marginalized individuals from the negligence of the government by establishing socio-economic rights like the right to food, education and livelihood and the right to a clean environment through a rather expansive appreciation of the right to life and liberty.\nHowever, the court has been cautious when it comes to the rights of the individual confronted by an invasive state and a domineering society. Its judgment defining privacy as a fundamental right represents a tremendous change in direction.\nIn the ruling, the court envisaged the right to privacy as flowing through other crucial rights like equality, dignity, life, liberty, expression, association and speech.\nThe justices navigated privacy as a multifaceted right. They highlighted its contours through violations including forced feeding, lack of reproductive choices and telephone tapping.\nThey emphasized privacy as a necessary condition for \xe2\x80\x9cseclusion,\xe2\x80\x9d which in turn enables the exercise of freedoms like speech, expression and association.\nThe court also made clear that bodily integrity, informational privacy and privacy of personal choice is inextricably linked to democracy, dignity and fraternity, which are provided for by the Constitution.\nThis conception of privacy as illustrated by violations, as facilitating seclusion, and as enabling classical civil and political rights and linked to the larger political project of democracy and fraternity, is what makes the Supreme Court judgment such a watershed moment. The judges reminded India that \xe2\x80\x9cthe purpose of elevating certain rights to the stature of guaranteed fundamental rights is to insulate their exercise from the disdain of majorities, whether legislative or popular.\xe2\x80\x9d\nThe court also cleansed its own institutional reputation by choosing constitutional morality over majoritarian morality. An 1860 colonial law that criminalized same-sex intimacy as \xe2\x80\x9cunnatural sex\xe2\x80\x9d stayed on the books in independent India. In 2009, the Delhi High Court annulled it, saying it violated the rights of L.G.B.T. Indians. A few years later, the Supreme Court overruled the High Court judgment and criminalized same-sex relations again.\nIn the privacy judgment, the justices of the Supreme Court tore apart the homophobia of their predecessors and castigated their reasoning. The court, though, stopped short of overruling its 2012 decision since it has yet to hear the curative petitions and constitutional challenge filed by L.G.B.T. Indians.\nThe judgment has also given legal and constitutional impetus to other issues before the court, including petitions arguing for criminalization of marital rape and challenges to beef bans. The jurisprudence of choice in personal and public life will be argued as a binding constitutional principle in these cases as well as the same-sex cases.\nAnd the privacy ruling represents a remarkable shift in the Supreme Court from a reticent post-colonial court on matters of individual liberty to an erudite constitutional court safeguarding freedom in the terrifying times of new India. The court is showing that it will be the institution most responsible for India\xe2\x80\x99s enduring as a constitutional democracy.\n'

aS'A large but widely ignored presence in New York City on the eve of Sept. 11, 2001, was Hurricane Erin, its cyclonic swirl starkly visible in weather maps like an ominous asterisk just off the coast. Two groups noticed: meteorologists, who mentioned the storm in passing, if at all, in news reports; and surfers, who chattered breathlessly about it.\nThe meteorologists were blas\xc3\xa9 because at no point in its journey from the tropics had Hurricane Erin threatened to make landfall, except briefly as it brushed past Bermuda, and it was now poised to be blown out to sea by a powerful cold front. But the same winds that would be flushing the storm away from land would also be grooming the big waves that it had been steadily producing in its crawl up the East Coast. This was to be a once-in-a-decade swell. Surfers were, as they say, \xe2\x80\x9cfrothing.\xe2\x80\x9d\nThat these glorious waves would be arriving on a Tuesday, a workday morning, was a problem but hardly an insoluble one. Like many other surfers in the area, I planned to call in sick. In my case, however, this was complicated by my having recently been named director of the writing program at the college in Brooklyn where I taught. Tuesday, Sept. 11, was the first day of classes.\nI had scheduled myself to teach the main writing seminar taken by freshmen, which met at 10 a.m. When I pictured these eager new arrivals reading the sign posted on the classroom door announcing my absence, then turning away in disappointment, yes, I felt guilty \xe2\x80\x94 but nowhere near so guilty as not to cancel class. A class, after all, could be made up later in the semester; a once-in-a-decade swell was an evanescent natural miracle of sorts. I wanted to make a good first impression, a solid directorial debut, but I wanted to go surfing more.\nThus the disruptive power of surfing, which exerts an allegiance to itself and a faithlessness to the rest of the world that is capable of ending romantic relationships and terminating gainful employment at the rise of a swell. If I had never learned to surf, Tuesday would have dawned like any other workday and I would have fulfilled my teacherly duties ignorant of the oceanic joy on offer.\nBut I had learned to surf \xe2\x80\x94 in the Vietnam era, in Florida. I was a surfer before I was a writer or a teacher of writing, before, in a sense, I was a citizen. In the surf is where I feel most at home, most alive, most at peace. I remember as a boy looking back at shore from the lineup on a day of good waves, at the houses and stores, the cars passing along the beach road. How foreign it seemed, how little I cared about its striving and admonitions.\nOn that Tuesday morning in 2001, I stood at my living room window and watched impatiently for the arrival of my surf buddy in his car. We had been making the journey out to Long Beach, on Long Island, together for years. He was dropping his daughter off at nursery school, then driving over to my neighborhood to pick me up. But it was 8:45 a.m. and my friend was supposed to have arrived at 8:30. I was trying not to think about the waves we were missing \xe2\x80\x94 a grinding anguish that is the dark side of surfing\xe2\x80\x99s sunny insouciance.\nI lived in a faculty house on the edge of campus. Students were now streaming past on their way to 9 o\xe2\x80\x99clock classes, colleagues and administrators pulling into the parking lot in their cars. When my friend finally rolled up, I would have to carry my surfboard through this throng. Nothing says \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m blowing off work\xe2\x80\x9d like strapping a board to the roof of a car. But there was no helping that.\nI was half-listening to the local public radio station as I waited. An announcement came over the air about some kind of incident at the World Trade Center. Then the FM signal went out. My wife eventually found the station on AM. A witness was reporting having seen a plane fly low across the city and into one of the towers. We turned on the TV to find an image of a tower with gray smoke pouring from an enormous gash high up, like a fatal head wound.\nYears before, I had worked in the World Trade Center, on the 82nd floor, teaching English to Japanese businessmen. I\xe2\x80\x99d had to change elevators on the way up, like transferring on the subway. I could remember the sunlight coming in through the narrow windows. To see this tower burning was like looking back at the shore on that day of good waves in my youth, when I found civilian life so foreign. Only this time I could see myself there. I was up there in the sheer, pitiless air of the 82nd floor.\nThe phone rang. It was my friend. He said he had noticed the smoke in the sky after dropping his daughter off at nursery school. When he got back to his house, he went up to the roof and saw a long streak of smoke with bits of white glitter in it \xe2\x80\x94 office paper, he realized. It led all the way back to the tower. He was weeping as he told me.\nThen the second plane hit.\nThe college canceled classes. I walked over to my class and told my students in person, as if I had had every intention of teaching. I had little else to say. I was too stunned. They went up to the roofs of the campus buildings; I went home. Later, I heard their shouts as first one then the other tower collapsed.\nThe next day there were small leftover waves from the hurricane swell. I did what I usually do when I\xe2\x80\x99ve lost my bearings: I headed for the ocean, driving out to Long Beach on my own. I was thinking about stories I had read on the internet about surfers who had called in sick to jobs at places like Cantor Fitzgerald and lived. I took a wrong turn and wound up on one of the ring roads of Kennedy Airport. When I realized my mistake, I tried to make a U-turn. A cluster of plainclothes policemen staking out the intersection angrily waved me down, leaning into the windows of my car to ask why I turned around when I saw them.\n\xe2\x80\x9cI got lost,\xe2\x80\x9d I said. I pointed at my board where it lay in the back. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m just trying to go surfing.\xe2\x80\x9d\n'

aS'ABBEVILLE, S.C. \xe2\x80\x94 In September 1984, my wife, Susan, and I left Fairfield, Conn., our home for 43 years, and drove south. We\xe2\x80\x99d had enough of New England winters. We stopped 23 hours later in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., rented a 450-square-foot apartment on the Intracoastal Waterway a mile from the beach, and began our new life in \xe2\x80\x9cparadise.\xe2\x80\x9d\nOur lives revolved around the sun and the beach during the day after work, and the bars, restaurants and clubs at night. The only downside to paradise was the influx of 375,000 crazed spring breakers from December to Easter, and the occasional hurricane from June to November, which frightened us less than did those drunken college kids diving off the balconies of motels into swimming pools, which, on occasion, they missed.\nWe felt we had nothing to fear from hurricanes because we had nothing to lose \xe2\x80\x94 just a rented apartment, a few sticks of thrift-store furniture and our rusted-out 1974 Alfa Romeo sedan. When a hurricane approached, we went to the beach to watch the grayish-blue squalls swirling toward us low over the ocean. When the winds got so strong they blew us off our feet, we hustled across the street to wait out the storm in a bar. In those days, every bar had a \xe2\x80\x9churricane party.\xe2\x80\x9d\nThen our lives changed. We got a dog and a parrot in the late \xe2\x80\x9980s. Then more dogs. We were responsible for other lives now. We didn\xe2\x80\x99t go out much to bars anymore, especially during hurricanes. We stayed in our apartment to comfort our terrified pets as the wind rattled our sliding glass doors close to the waterway.\nBy 1992, we had six shiba inu dogs and other \xe2\x80\x9cthings of value\xe2\x80\x9d we had to protect: a new car and a small wood-framed bungalow, built in 1926. A week after we signed the contract for the house we watched the Weather Channel in horror as Hurricane Andrew began its long, methodical slog across the Atlantic toward Fort Lauderdale. We woke each morning at 4 a.m. for days watching the storm\xe2\x80\x99s track, hoping for a shift, but it was not to be.\nThe day before Andrew was to hit us, we threw our clothes in our car, four dogs in the back seat, two dogs in front \xe2\x80\x94 one on Susie\xe2\x80\x99s lap, the other on the floor between her legs \xe2\x80\x94 and our parrot in a carrying case wedged between the front seats. Then we drove north. When we reached Gainesville, Fla., we found a motel room off I-75. On a little piece of grass outside, other dog owners walked every kind of dog imaginable. This was our first hurricane lesson: In paradise, the most precious possessions of so many residents were their pets, which had replaced the family they had left behind in the North.\nAfter Andrew had passed through, we drove back home. Trees were down, water had sloshed up off the canal, but essentially paradise was intact. Our bungalow was untouched. Why not? It had survived 66 years of hurricanes.\nOver the next 13 years, we became hurricane veterans. We learned the drill. We watched the Weather Channel throughout the day and night from June to November. We learned how to read the hurricanes, to separate the ones that were forecasters\xe2\x80\x99 hype from ones that were serious threats. We had heavy-duty plywood shutters built for our windows. We had a reliable store of batteries and flashlights, battery-powered hurricane lamps, a battery-operated radio, gallons of water, cans and boxes of food that would keep.\nAnd bottles of vodka, for Susie, and bourbon for me. Lots of it. The best way to get through a hurricane thrashing against your house is to drink your way through it, wake the next day with a headache to see the wind gone.\nAt first, we bought our supplies three and four days before a hurricane hit. Then we refined our strategy to a day or two. I filled the bathtub with water we could use in the toilet when we lost power. I cleaned and oiled our 9-millimeter pistols, then loaded them.\nIn 2004, three hurricanes hit us in the space of six weeks, Charley, Frances and Jean. They each lingered off shore, one after the other, blowing at us for weeks as we sat in darkness.\nWe were in our mid-60s when Wilma hit in 2005. Wilma was a beast, its force like a herd of dinosaurs thundering past our shuttered windows. It was the first time we were ever scared for our lives in a hurricane. Susie held our oldest dog, Kiri, who was shivering from fear. Wilma lingered from the early morning until noon when, suddenly, it was gone. The sun came out. We ventured outside like cave dwellers into sunlight, blinking our eyes. All our neighbors were outside, too, sawing fallen limbs, heaping trash and broken objects on the swale.\nParadise was never the same for us again. Our beloved Kiri died three weeks after Wilma. We put our house up for sale in 2008, and in March 2009, we moved into our current house, a big, old Victorian on a hill here in Abbeville, S.C. Our real estate broker told us we would never have to worry about hurricanes again. \xe2\x80\x9cAbbeville doesn\xe2\x80\x99t get weather,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cThe only weather we ever got was a tornado in \xe2\x80\x9973.\xe2\x80\x9d\nOne night a few days after we arrived, Susie and the dogs were sleeping while I watched a movie on TV. A narrow banner of letters rolled across the top of the screen: \xe2\x80\x9cTornado warning for Abbeville County.\xe2\x80\x9d Three minutes later all hell broke loose. A fierce wind rattled our old windows, and I heard the cracking of tree limbs and then their thunderous crashes to earth. In minutes the tornado was gone and everything was still again. My wife and the dogs slept through it.\nThat was the only weather we\xe2\x80\x99ve ever had in Abbeville for the eight years we\xe2\x80\x99ve lived here. Until today, of course, with Irma bearing up on us, from Florida. We\xe2\x80\x99re two old people now, with a sense of mortality we lacked when we arrived in Florida three decades ago, oblivious to the effect hurricanes could have on people\xe2\x80\x99s lives.\n'

aS'Who should have the right to define rape: survivors who have experienced sexual violence or those who are accused of perpetrating it?\nThat is the core question raised by Education Secretary \n this month to replace Obama-era guidelines on how universities handle sexual misconduct complaints. In a strongly worded speech, Ms. DeVos made clear that she believed the previous administration had used \xe2\x80\x9cintimidation and coercion\xe2\x80\x9d to force colleges to adopt disciplinary procedures that deprived accused students of their rights.\nTo come to these conclusions, Ms. DeVos and her staff appear to have given special consideration to the concerns of men accused of sexual assault. After one hearing about campus rape policies, Candice Jackson, the top civil rights official in the Department of Education, said, \xe2\x80\x9cThe accusations \xe2\x80\x94 90 percent of them \xe2\x80\x94 fall into the category of \xe2\x80\x98we were both drunk, we broke up, and six months later I found myself under a Title IX investigation because she just decided that our last sleeping together was not quite right.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9d\nMs. Jackson has since called these remarks \xe2\x80\x9cflippant,\xe2\x80\x9d but they reveal a gross misunderstanding of sexual assault. Ms. Jackson essentially intimated that she believes either that alcohol-facilitated sexual assault and intimate partner violence are not real or that, at the very least, they are not harmful enough to merit disciplinary action. No wonder Ms. DeVos thinks many sexual assault complaints on campus are baseless. According to Ms. Jackson\xe2\x80\x99s incorrect logic, almost any college man facing disciplinary proceedings would be falsely accused. And yet there is plenty of evidence that false accusations of rape are \n.\nObama-era policies did not malign men. What they did was make it easier for victims to come forward. A 2011 \xe2\x80\x9cDear Colleague\xe2\x80\x9d letter from the Obama administration advised universities to change the standard for how to determine guilt from proof that was \xe2\x80\x9cbeyond a reasonable doubt\xe2\x80\x9d to a \xe2\x80\x9cpreponderance of evidence\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 or, more colloquially, more likely than not.\nBefore 2011, most colleges had already voluntarily made these changes. There are several good reasons for that. The \xe2\x80\x9cbeyond a reasonable doubt\xe2\x80\x9d evidentiary standard usually applies to criminal charges \xe2\x80\x94 and college tribunals are not criminal courts. Colleges can\xe2\x80\x99t determine whether or not an assailant will go to prison. But they are required to keep students safe and promote equal access to education under Title IX, the civil rights law that secures nondiscrimination on the basis of sex or gender in federally funded educational programs. Sexual assault complaints are essentially civil rights disputes, and a preponderance of evidence standard is what is \n in civil rights cases.\nThe preponderance of evidence standard is also survivor-centered. When judging whether someone has been raped, it\xe2\x80\x99s almost impossible to assert that a sex act constituted violence \xe2\x80\x9cbeyond a reasonable doubt.\xe2\x80\x9d Many survivors struggle to produce what campus hearing boards would consider evidence, especially when it comes to acquaintance- or date-based \n in which alcohol made it impossible for someone to physically resist. Sexual assaults also commonly occur away from third-party witnesses, limiting the potential for corroborating testimonies. Finally, trauma can make survivors seem \n to campus administrators who are untrained.\nThe difficulty in providing hard evidence has long presented a devastating barrier for victims\xe2\x80\x99 access to recourse and remedies, and it discouraged survivors from coming forward. The Obama administration responded to survivors\xe2\x80\x99 needs by lowering the burden of proof necessary to gain access to institutional support. That \n are reporting their sexual assaults to their universities shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t lead us to the conclusion that more college students are being raped or that more students are lying \xe2\x80\x94 just that more feel comfortable coming forward.\nOf course, being accused of sexual assault hurts. And there are things that we can and should do to help accused students \xe2\x80\x94 namely, providing them with psychological counsel. But accused men\xe2\x80\x99s pain does not excuse rape, and men shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be the ones defining it. Most rapists, even those who have been criminally convicted, \n as such. More broadly, there is a \n to define sexual assault according to their own standards, not according to campus guidelines.\nThe ramifications of sexual assault are severe. Especially when they \n, survivors often experience \n, \n and \n. They are at a higher risk of \n, \n and \n. Though they vary, the approximations of how many women have been sexually assaulted in college are always high.\nThat should be the education secretary\xe2\x80\x99s biggest concern.\n'

aS'From the moment we humans first imagined having mechanical servants at our beck and call, we\xe2\x80\x99ve assumed they would be constructed in our own image. Outfitted with arms and legs, heads and torsos, they would perform everyday tasks that we\xe2\x80\x99d otherwise have to do ourselves. Like the indefatigable maid Rosie on \xe2\x80\x9cThe Jetsons,\xe2\x80\x9d the officious droid C-3PO in \xe2\x80\x9cStar Wars\xe2\x80\x9d and the tortured \xe2\x80\x9chost\xe2\x80\x9d Dolores Abernathy in \xe2\x80\x9cWestworld,\xe2\x80\x9d the robotic helpmates of popular culture have been humanoid in form and function.\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s time to rethink our assumptions. A robot invasion of our homes is underway, but the machines \xe2\x80\x94 so-called smart speakers like Amazon Echo, Google Home and the forthcoming Apple HomePod \xe2\x80\x94 look nothing like what we expected. Small, squat and stationary, they resemble vases or cat food tins more than they do people.\nEcho and its ilk do, however, share a crucial trait with their imaginary forebears: They illuminate the times. Whatever their shape, robots tell us something important about our technologies and ourselves.\nAlthough smart speakers have been around just three years, they already have a hold on us. The devices, powered by \xe2\x80\x9cchatbots\xe2\x80\x9d like Siri and Alexa, are in the midst of a sales boom. Some 35 million Americans now use the diminutive, talking computers \xe2\x80\x94 more than twice the number of just a year ago, according to estimates by eMarketer \xe2\x80\x94 and analysts predict that three-quarters of United States households will own at least one of the gadgets by 2020.\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s not hard to understand the attraction. Smart speakers are oracles of the countertop. They may not be able to speak for the gods, but they can deliver reports on news, traffic and weather. And they have other talents that their Delphic ancestor couldn\xe2\x80\x99t even dream of: They can serve as D.J. They can diagnose ailments and soothe anxieties. They can read bedtime stories.They can even bark like a watchdog to scare off burglars. And they promise to be the major-domos of home automation, adjusting lights, controlling appliances and issuing orders to specialized robots like the Roomba vacuum cleaner.\nStill, if you were looking forward to having a Rosie scurrying around your abode, feather duster in hand, an Echo feels like a letdown. It just sits there.\nThere are good reasons that the domestic robot has taken such an uninspiring form. Some are technical. Visualizing a nimble, sure-footed android is easy, but building one is hard. As the Carnegie Mellon professor Illah Nourbakhsh explains in his book \xe2\x80\x9cRobot Futures,\xe2\x80\x9d it requires advances not only in artificial intelligence but also in the complex hardware systems required for movement, perception and dexterity.\nThe human nervous system is a marvel of physical control, able to sense and respond fluidly to an ever-changing environment. Achieving such agility with silicon and steel lies well beyond the reach of today\xe2\x80\x99s engineers. Even the most advanced of our current automatons still get flustered by mundane tasks like loading a dishwasher or dusting knickknacks.\nMeanwhile, thanks to gains in networking, language processing and miniaturization, it has become simple to manufacture small, cheap computers that can understand basic questions and commands, gather and synthesize information from online databanks and control other electronics. The technology industry has enormous incentives to promote such gadgets. Now that many of the biggest tech companies operate like media businesses, trafficking in information, they\xe2\x80\x99re in a race to create new products to charm and track consumers.\nSmart speakers provide a powerful complement to smartphones in this regard. Equipped with sensitive microphones, they serve as in-home listening devices \xe2\x80\x94 benign-seeming bugs \xe2\x80\x94 that greatly extend the companies\xe2\x80\x99 ability to monitor people\xe2\x80\x99s habits. Whenever you chat with a smart speaker, you\xe2\x80\x99re disclosing valuable information about your routines and proclivities.\nBeyond the technical challenges, there\xe2\x80\x99s a daunting psychological barrier to constructing and selling anthropomorphic machines. No one has figured out how to bridge what computer scientists term the \xe2\x80\x9cuncanny valley\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 the wide gap we sense between ourselves and imitations of ourselves. Because we\xe2\x80\x99re such social beings, our minds are exquisitely sensitive to the expressions, gestures and manners of others. Any whiff of artificiality triggers revulsion. Humanoid robots seem creepy to us, and the more closely they\xe2\x80\x99re designed to mimic us, the creepier they are. That puts roboticists in a bind: The more perfect their creations, the less likely we\xe2\x80\x99ll want them in our homes. Lacking human characteristics, smart speakers avoid the uncanny valley altogether.\nAlthough they may not look like the robots we envisioned, smart speakers do have antecedents in our cultural fantasy life. The robot they most recall at the moment is HAL, the chattering eyeball in Stanley Kubrick\xe2\x80\x99s sci-fi classic \xe2\x80\x9c2001: A Space Odyssey.\xe2\x80\x9d But their current form \xe2\x80\x94 that of a stand-alone gadget \xe2\x80\x94 is not likely to be their ultimate form. They seem fated to shed their physical housing and turn into a sort of ambient digital companion. Alexa will come to resemble Samantha, the \xe2\x80\x9cartificially intelligent operating system\xe2\x80\x9d that beguiles the Joaquin Phoenix character in the movie \xe2\x80\x9cHer.\xe2\x80\x9d Through a network of speakers, microphones and sensors scattered around our homes, we\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to converse with our solicitous A.I. assistants wherever and whenever we like.\nMark Zuckerberg, the Facebook C.E.O., spent much of last year programming a prototype of such a virtual agent. In a video released in December, he gave a demo of the system. Walking around his Silicon Valley home, he conducted a running dialogue with his omnipresent chatbot, calling on it to supply him with a clean T-shirt and toast bread for his breakfast, play movies and music, and entertain his infant daughter. Hooked up to cameras with facial-recognition software, the digitized Jeeves also acted as a sentry for the Zuckerberg compound, screening visitors and unlocking the gate.\nWhether real or fictional, robots hold a mirror up to society. If Rosie and her kin embodied a 20th-century yearning for domestic order and familial bliss, smart speakers symbolize our own, more self-absorbed time.\nIt seems apt that as we come to live more of our lives virtually, through social networks and other simulations, our robots should take the form of disembodied avatars dedicated to keeping us comfortable in our media cocoons. Even as they spy on us, the devices offer sanctuary from the unruliness of reality, with all its frictions and strains. They place us in a virtual world meticulously arranged to suit our bents and biases, a world that understands us and shapes itself to our desires. Amazon\xe2\x80\x99s decision to draw on classical mythology in naming its smart speaker was a masterstroke. Every Narcissus deserves an Echo.\n'

aS'Republican lawmakers have wasted much of the year trying to repeal the Affordable Care Act, a move that would deprive millions of people of health insurance. They\xe2\x80\x99re back at it. Like a bad sequel to a terrible movie, a proposal whose main architects are Bill Cassidy of Louisiana and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina would in many ways be worse than bills that came before. It would punish states like \n that have done the most to increase access to health care and set in motion cuts to Medicaid, the federal-state program that provides insurance to \n, many of whom are disabled and elderly.\nThis is not an idle threat. President Trump wants this bill passed by the end of next week, before the expiration of a budget rule that allows the chamber to pass a health care bill with only 50 votes (and a tiebreaker from the vice president). It\xe2\x80\x99s unclear whether the votes are there, but the bill\xe2\x80\x99s chances increased on Monday when \n said he supported it. His endorsement is important because it could convince Senator John McCain, who cast the decisive vote against repealing the A.C.A. in July, to vote for this version.\nIt is hard to overstate the cruelty of the Graham-Cassidy bill. It would eliminate the mandate that even healthy people buy health insurance, end the subsidies that help people purchase coverage and stop the expansion of Medicaid. It would offer states block grants they could use to help people get insurance but would leave people at the mercy of individual state legislatures and, over all, would provide $239 billion less than what the federal government would spend under current law between 2020 and 2026, according to the \n.\nWorse, the formula for determining state grants would penalize the 31 states that expanded Medicaid under the A.C.A. so as to provide more money to the 19 states that did not. This is a cynical attempt to win votes by taking money from generous states that are more likely to be governed by Democrats and giving some of it to representatives of stingier states that are more likely to elect Republicans. The block grants would disappear entirely in 2027, and it is by no means certain, given the pitched partisan battles over health care in recent years, that Congress would be inclined to reauthorize them.\nGraham-Cassidy would further cripple Medicaid by putting a per-person cap on what the federal government spends on the program. Under current law, federal spending increases automatically to keep up with the rise in medical costs; a per-capita cap would leave governors, who are ultimately in charge of administering Medicaid, in the unenviable position of denying care to poor and older Americans.\nThe rush job proposed by Mr. Cassidy and Mr. Graham and endorsed by the president is deeply unfair and leaves other lawmakers with little time to understand what\xe2\x80\x99s in the bill or its true costs. The Congressional Budget Office says it will not be able to determine the full impact of the legislation, including its effect on premiums and the number of people who have insurance, for \n.\nThe Senate should show a little patience; a better, more humane option awaits it. Senators Lamar Alexander, Republican of Tennessee, and Patty Murray, Democrat of Washington, are working on a bill that would strengthen the A.C.A. by appropriating money for health subsidies that help low-income families; Mr. Trump has threatened to end those payments administratively. Mr. Alexander and Ms. Murray expect to produce their legislation this week.\n'

aS'When Justice Department investigators examined the city of Ferguson, Mo., after a white police officer shot and killed an African-American teenager named Michael Brown in 2014, they found no grounds to charge the officer with federal civil rights violations. But they did uncover endemic bigotry among city officials, as well as policing that routinely violated black residents\xe2\x80\x99 constitutional rights, with brutality and excessive, often bogus, enforcement.\nSuch enforcement was an essential component of a corrupt system in which the city budget depended heavily on fines and fees, as do other cities\xe2\x80\x99 throughout the country. Once caught up in Ferguson\xe2\x80\x99s system, African-Americans were far less likely than others to have their cases dismissed and were often required to return for multiple court appearances.\nFerguson agreed to a \n requiring it to root out the racist and unconstitutional practices that Justice officials \n in a hair-raising \n two years ago.\nThe city, however, has a further obligation: a moral duty to compensate victims of abusive policing. A case in point is \n, an African-American father of two who lost his home, career and peace of mind after he was unjustly arrested five years ago, with the city prosecutor pursuing the charges until dropping them last week.\nThe Justice Department cited Mr. Watson\xe2\x80\x99s case as a particularly vivid example of how the police routinely engaged in abusive and unconstitutional behavior. The encounter began with Mr. Watson sitting behind the wheel of his car near a Ferguson park after he had just played basketball. A police officer approached and drew his weapon.\nThe officer, who had a \n, accused Mr. Watson without cause of being a pedophile, forbade him to use his cellphone and demanded to search the car. When Mr. Watson cited his constitutional rights and refused, the officer searched the car without permission and issued several bogus tickets \xe2\x80\x94 including one for not wearing a seatbelt, even though the car was parked.\nThe city later claimed that Mr. Watson had pleaded guilty. But according to court documents, the city lacked records needed to support that claim. Moreover, a lawyer who represented Mr. Watson at the time maintained that he had entered no such agreement. Early this year, the St. Louis County court essentially nullified the suspect plea.\nMr. Watson, a veteran of the United States Navy, \n charging the city and the officer who arrested him with violating his rights.\nThe damage to the Watson family has been catastrophic. According to court documents, Mr. Watson\xe2\x80\x99s arrest cost him the top-security clearance that had allowed him to work in the cybersecurity industry for more than a decade. The family\xe2\x80\x99s lawyers say the Watson children have dropped out of private school and have periodically lived with their father in storage units or slept in their car.\nThe city needs to financially compensate the family and apologize for this tragedy. It also needs to consider whether it could truly be complying with the consent order if it continued to hound Mr. Watson for five years.\n'

aS'New York commuters ably survived the \xe2\x80\x9csummer of hell\xe2\x80\x9d that Gov. Andrew Cuomo had forecast because of repair work at the hobbled Pennsylvania Station. Now Manhattan is enduring a different form of hellishness: severe Midtown traffic as the United Nations General Assembly convenes and world leaders gather. It\xe2\x80\x99s a familiar late-summer headache. But it\xe2\x80\x99s likely to be worse than usual this time, with extra streets closed off as protection for President Trump, ensconced for several days in his Fifth Avenue aerie.\nWhat better moment than when bumpers nuzzle bumpers to be reminded of the need to reduce traffic in the business heart of the city through a redesigned system of tolls known as congestion pricing.\nThe concept has been embraced belatedly by Mr. Cuomo, who has yet to flesh out details of what his plan would look like. The governor correctly sees it as a way to raise gobs of cash for the city\xe2\x80\x99s ailing mass-transit network. But let\xe2\x80\x99s not forget that the true goal of this pricing mechanism is embodied in its name: decongesting streets for the benefit of drivers and pedestrians \xe2\x80\x94 and their lungs.\nThe main idea in play for now is a plan put forth by \n. It would discourage cars and trucks from entering Manhattan south of 60th Street during peak business hours, in part by imposing tolls on four East River bridges that are now free. (Lost in the mists of time is the fact that the bridges once had tolls. Mayor William Gaynor got rid of them in 1911.) As compensation, tolls on outer bridges like the Verrazano-Narrows and the Throgs Neck would be lowered. Electronic sensors would make it possible for the fees to be adjusted according to the time of day. There\xe2\x80\x99s no reason they could not be sharply lowered, even eliminated, late at night or on weekends.\nAnyone observing traffic on the toll-free bridges can see vast numbers of cars that carry only the person behind the wheel. Many people drive into Midtown and Lower Manhattan because they bear no cost other than the price of gas.\nNaturally, this proposal has resisters, notably politicians representing Brooklyn, Queens and the eastern suburbs, whose constituents take to cars more than Manhattan or Bronx residents do. No one pretends that getting Albany\xe2\x80\x99s required approval is a cinch.\nBill de Blasio, the city\xe2\x80\x99s Brooklyn-philic mayor, has his own objections. He describes congestion pricing as a \xe2\x80\x9cregressive tax\xe2\x80\x9d on lower-income drivers, unfairly making them pay the same toll as the wealthy. The mayor prefers what he describes as a \xe2\x80\x9cmillionaires tax\xe2\x80\x9d to raise money for the subways.\nThe reality, however, is that New York car owners tend to be better off. For starters, more than half the households in the city are carless, according to a census analysis by the \n. The median household income of those with wheels is more than double that of those without \xe2\x80\x94 $85,000 compared with $40,630. Writing in \n on Sunday, Veronica Vanterpool, executive director of the tri-state campaign, said, \xe2\x80\x9cA regressive transportation policy is what we have now: a system that favors free travel by drivers and ignores the environmental, social and economic costs of car-clogged city streets.\xe2\x80\x9d\nWe agree. Besides, there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing regressive about plowing toll revenue into improvements for mass transit, which is how most low- and middle-income New Yorkers get around. Some might even call it progressive.\n'

aS'When the South Korean military killed hundreds of pro-democracy protesters and laid siege to the southwestern city of Gwangju in \n, few people outside the city knew what was happening. Martial law had been declared, the already censored press was completely gagged, and all communications with Gwangju were cut off. The end of the 10-day siege marked the beginning of a seven-year period of military repression and terror under Gen. \n, who outdid his predecessor, Gen. Park Chung-hee, in brutality and corruption.\nOne generation later, millions of Korean citizens \n in dozens of cities across the country for 20 continuous weekends of \xe2\x80\x9ccandlelight rallies,\xe2\x80\x9d from the autumn of 2016 to the spring of 2017. They called for the \n of then-President \n, General Park\xe2\x80\x99s daughter, for her part in a scandal involving corruption, bribery and abuse of power. This time around, the entire world knew what was going on in South Korea.\nThe country\xe2\x80\x99s advanced information technology infrastructure made the difference. Smartphones turned front-line protesters into videographers. Millions commented on the political situation on Kakao Talk (a Korean messaging service), Facebook and other social media channels.\nTechnology alone is not enough to establish true democracy. Not all technologically advanced nations have vibrant grass-roots political engagement, and in many countries, devices and software are being abused \xe2\x80\x94 used for surveillance or to manipulate information, while anti-democratic extremists spread their views on the same platforms.\nAdvanced technology can enable democracy by giving citizens more time and energy for political engagement and by making corrupt political practices like vote-buying more difficult. However, what\xe2\x80\x99s most important is constant civic engagement \xe2\x80\x94 without that, democracy withers away.\nThe popular \xe2\x80\x9cAsian values\xe2\x80\x9d thesis suggests that Asians are culturally disinclined to democracy because they favor the good of the community over individual rights. That is untrue: South Koreans have fought for democracy throughout modern history.\nIn 1945, when the Japanese left after 35 years of colonial rule, no South Korean called for the restoration of the monarchy. In 1960, a mass protest against misrule and electoral fraud ousted the republic\xe2\x80\x99s first president, Rhee Syngman. Throughout General Park\xe2\x80\x99s 18 years of iron-fisted rule, students and workers agitated and risked their lives for democracy. In 1987, 19 days of violent street demonstrations led by students, workers and even young managers ended his successor\xe2\x80\x99s military rule.\nWith the \xe2\x80\x9ccandlelight revolution,\xe2\x80\x9d Koreans have elevated their democracy to another level. But the challenge they face is formidable. The protesters were calling for more than just the ousting of an errant president and her cronies: They want to create a cleaner and fairer society.\nThe most immediate challenge Koreans face is that of ridding the political system of corruption. Illicit dealings among politicians, high-ranking officials and chaebols \xe2\x80\x94 family-controlled business empires \xe2\x80\x94 are common. This August, \n, the de facto head of Samsung, one of the most prominent chaebols, was \n to five years in prison for bribing Park and her notorious confidante \n.\nSome believe that corruption can be eliminated by further deregulation, with the idea that this would reduce the number of opportunities for collusion with public officials, and by strengthening minority shareholder rights, on the theory that shareholders will expose corrupt dealings by those who run the chaebols. However, a much more fundamental shift in the distribution of power is required if there is to be a reduction in corruption. Decision-making abilities need to be transferred from the political and business elites to citizens, civic organizations, trade unions and other \xe2\x80\x9ccountervailing powers,\xe2\x80\x9d to borrow an expression from the economist John Kenneth Galbraith.\nThen there is the issue of fairness. Increasing deregulation has reduced protections for small factories and shops, which used to supply jobs that kept income inequality relatively low. The spread of American-style salary norms in the past decade or so has led to a tremendous increase in wage inequality \xe2\x80\x94 South Korea has one of the fastest-growing levels among the countries in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.\nBut what angers South Koreans most is the marked drop in social mobility and the sense of hopelessness that haunts young people from less-privileged backgrounds \xe2\x80\x94 that is, most young people.\nThis lack of social mobility is sometimes the result of blatantly corrupt practices. Of all the corruption scandals the former president faces, particularly upsetting for many was the accusation that Ms. Choi \n Ewha Womans University in Seoul, one of the nation\xe2\x80\x99s leading universities, to accept Ms. Choi\xe2\x80\x99s daughter at the expense of candidates who were better qualified.\nThe barriers to university applicants are usually subtle. It\xe2\x80\x99s the extras that make a candidate for admission stand out, such as extracurricular activities or expensive private tutoring for university entrance exams. At the beginning of their careers, expectations that candidates have completed internships may stand in the way. Poor parents cannot even dream of helping their children with such things.\nMany young Koreans believe, rightly, that equality of opportunity is impossible in the face of ostensibly fair rules that favor the daughters and sons of the rich and the powerful.\nRemoving these barriers to social mobility will be even more difficult than reducing corruption. Big changes in the education system are needed, and especially in the university application process. This will also require the expansion of the welfare state so that children from less-privileged backgrounds can have a chance at moving up the social ladder through early learning programs, publicly funded enrichment schemes, and the increased parental attention and family stability that extra income can provide.\nKoreans have shown the world that an engaged citizenry, armed with the latest technologies, can work a democratic miracle. That miracle will fade away and people will become disillusioned with democracy if the government does not deliver a cleaner and fairer society soon.\n'

aS'On Sept. 1 Kenya\xe2\x80\x99s Supreme Court made the unprecedented decision to nullify the results of the country\xe2\x80\x99s Aug. 8 presidential election, \n the victory by incumbent President Uhuru Kenyatta and calling for fresh elections in 60 days. A decade after the 2007 presidential election was followed by violence that killed more than 1,000 people, it is a historic moment not just for Kenya but also for the continent, and guarantees greater global attention on the country this fall.\nIn response to a \n filed by the opposition leader and former prime minister Raila Odinga, the court ruled the election was not conducted in accordance with the Constitution, citing \xe2\x80\x9cillegalities and irregularities\xe2\x80\x9d committed by Kenya\xe2\x80\x99s election commission.\nThe court ruling didn\xe2\x80\x99t contradict the \n of the Carter Center, whose team we led, or those of other observer missions, including the European Union and African Union, whose findings were broadly similar.\nMultiple media reports suggested inaccurately that we and other international observers had declared the election free and fair. Our preliminary \n two days after the election insisted that the tallying process was in progress and that an overall assessment could be provided only after the process was complete.\nAlthough our observers had noted isolated instances of procedural irregularities in voting and counting, these did not appear to affect the integrity of those processes, which had functioned relatively smoothly.\nWe also indicated that the electronic transmission of results proved unreliable, with electronic scans of results forms not arriving as planned at constituency-level tally centers, where the results were tabulated\nAs a backup measure, the election commission instructed the constituency centers to rely instead on the \n results forms to tally the official results. We noted that the paper-based backup system, if implemented properly, would allow verification of the ballots cast and that agents of political parties had been at most stations and received copies they could crosscheck with the official results.\nAt the time, there had been sporadic outbreaks of violence, followed by reports of excessive use of force by the government. Mr. Odinga argued he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t take his case to court but would instead let it play out in \xe2\x80\x9cthe court of \n opinion.\xe2\x80\x9d It reminded us of the 2007 elections when Mr. Odinga lost to President Mwai Kibaki and mass violence followed.\nOur major exhortation \xe2\x80\x94 which angered some at the time \xe2\x80\x94 was that all aggrieved parties should pursue their disputes in the courts, not the streets. We and the other international observer mission leaders pressed, both publicly and in private meetings with leaders, for claims of misconduct and fraud to be fully investigated, rather than reduced to rhetoric and innuendo.\nMany in the media, including this newspaper\xe2\x80\x99s editorial page, have wondered whether the court ruling has exposed flaws in election observation missions. What they misunderstand is that our early reports were preliminary, covering only the voting and counting stages, not the critical postelection phases of tabulation and dispute resolution that were still ongoing. They also overlook that international observers led the call for candidates to take their disputes to the courts. That happened, and that is a good thing.\nOur observers remain in Kenya and continue their monitoring work. A final comprehensive report will be completed after the conclusion of the new election and the resolution of any petitions.\nIn its electoral petition, Mr. Odinga\xe2\x80\x99s opposition coalition claimed that the election commission did not follow proper procedures in tabulating and announcing final results and that there were inaccuracies in the forms recording polling station results and constituency-level tallying. They also claimed that the commission\xe2\x80\x99s servers were hacked to manipulate results. The election commission has confirmed that there were attempts to hack its servers, but officials deny that any malfeasance occurred.\nThe Supreme Court has not yet said what parts of Mr. Odinga\xe2\x80\x99s challenge it agreed with. Until it releases a detailed explanation, it is impossible to know the precise basis for its decision and for the commission to plan corrective actions. The court should be commended for affording due process and a transparent review, bolstering public confidence in its independence and reducing tensions across the country.\nThe election commission has announced that the new election will be held on Oct. 17. It is critical that the process be conducted flawlessly. The government needs to provide the financial resources to make that possible and take steps to ensure the security of the commissioners, candidates and voters.\nInitially, President Kenyatta spoke about respecting the court\xe2\x80\x99s decision, but sadly, in subsequent statements, he \n the judges as \xe2\x80\x9ccrooks\xe2\x80\x9d and vowed to \xe2\x80\x9cfix\xe2\x80\x9d the court if re-elected. All Kenyans, especially its political leaders, need to act responsibly and ensure that the new electoral process is peaceful.\nThis is a critical time for Kenya. Democracy is hard work requiring many hands. The court\xe2\x80\x99s historic decision means the world will be watching this race even more closely, and international election monitors must as well. A transparent, credible and peaceful process will affirm the power of Kenya\xe2\x80\x99s democracy \xe2\x80\x94 after its court system has already affirmed the strength of its institutions.\n'

aS'Nelson Mandela\xe2\x80\x99s dream of a free, prosperous and nonracial South Africa has turned into a nightmare. The nation\xe2\x80\x99s constitution, often hailed as one of the most progressive in the world, is under siege by the very man who took an oath to protect it.\nPresident Jacob Zuma, in office since 2009, is subverting democracy. Mr. Zuma, who recently survived his \n vote in Parliament, has enabled political patronage and exploited South Africa\xe2\x80\x99s institutions for his own benefit and that of the ruling elites in his party, the African National Congress. He has grossly mismanaged the country\xe2\x80\x99s resources and engaged in acts of far-reaching cronyism. Saddest of all, Mr. Zuma has fomented a deep sense of disillusionment among many of the nation\xe2\x80\x99s black youth.\nYes, Mr. Mandela\xe2\x80\x99s \n brought prosperity to post-apartheid South Africa, but the distribution of economic benefits was skewed in favor of the white establishment and black elite. Even today, little of this prosperity has reached the black youth, and many blame Mr. Mandela for delivering what they see as a superficial notion of freedom rather than an enduring democracy with opportunities for all.\nMr. Zuma\xe2\x80\x99s rampant corruption has bolstered this disillusionment.\nFor instance, shortly after he became president, Mr. Zuma spent 246 million rand (about $23 million at the time) in state funds to upgrade his private country residence. In 2014, South Africa\xe2\x80\x99s Office of the Public Protector \n to reimburse some of those costs, yet he resisted for more than a year, at times pointing to the A.N.C.\xe2\x80\x99s majority in Parliament to validate his defiance. Eventually, South Africa\xe2\x80\x99s High Court ordered him to comply with the public protector\xe2\x80\x99s order, but the impunity has continued.\nMore recently, according to media reports, leaked emails and the findings of the public protector, Mr. Zuma outsourced some aspects of governance to a family of expats from India that has established businesses with his son, Duduzane Zuma, and is profiting from government contracts while exerting political influence wherever it can. The family \xe2\x80\x94 brothers Ajay, Atul and Rajesh Gupta, and their nephew Varun Gupta \xe2\x80\x94 even influence ministerial appointments.\nIn 2016 Mcebisi Jonas, then a deputy minister of finance, reported that he had been summoned to the Gupta family mansion and offered 600 million rand (about $43 million) if he accepted the position of finance minister. According to Mr. Jonas, the Guptas told him that the president was going to remove the current minister of finance, who had allegedly blocked some lucrative contracts and become an obstacle to the Guptas\xe2\x80\x99 access to the treasury.\nMr. Jonas had enough integrity to refuse the offer. But Mr. Zuma nevertheless replaced the finance minister with a Gupta-approved official, who, after a public outcry, lasted only a weekend.\nMeanwhile, as the Guptas and Duduzane Zuma amass untold wealth in South Africa, and as allegations of their profiteering dominate the headlines, President Zuma\xe2\x80\x99s ruling A.N.C. has \n.\nAnd yet the president continues to enjoy powerful support from sectors of the electorate. Mr. Zuma remains popular in rural areas, particularly among the Zulu people, South Africa\xe2\x80\x99s largest ethnic group. They embrace him as a charismatic, conservative man with four wives who speaks their language at political rallies and makes inside ethnic jokes.\nAnother source of power for Mr. Zuma is South Africa\xe2\x80\x99s electoral system, which is not constituency-based, but proportion-based. Voters do not directly elect their representatives; they vote for political parties. Party bosses then compile lists of candidates and dictate how members of the legislatures should vote. All of them toe the line, since none want to jeopardize their livelihoods.\nThen there is the Umkhonto We Sizwe Military Veterans Association, a ragtag army of ardent Zuma supporters in ill-fitting camouflage uniforms who purport to be veterans of the A.N.C.\xe2\x80\x99s guerrilla war against the apartheid regime (though members in their early 20s are too young to have fought in a war that ended more than 25 years ago). Mr. Zuma recently tried to put this group on a war footing, instructing them to close ranks behind him and defend his beleaguered \xe2\x80\x9crevolution\xe2\x80\x9d against those who protest against him.\nNot all is lost, however. Despite South Africa\xe2\x80\x99s perverted state, the independent judiciary has been a saving grace, and a robust media regularly exposes government corruption. Additionally, the Congress of South African Trade Unions, the South African Communist Party and factions within the A.N.C. have banded together and demanded that Mr. Zuma step down. So have a number of civil society organizations (some led by A.N.C. members), which have organized mass demonstrations in major cities.\nAdditionally, opposition parties, previously weak and ineffectual, have a much louder voice since being joined in Parliament by the Economic Freedom Fighters, a more radical party that has gained a large following among unemployed black youths.\nDespite all this, Mr. Zuma is unlikely to relinquish power.\nWere he to step down, civil groups and the opposition would undoubtedly see to it that the \n of corruption and money laundering leveled against Mr. Zuma in 2009 be reactivated. The charges were dropped shortly before his election as president, but last year South Africa\xe2\x80\x99s High Court ordered that they be reinstated. However, the prosecution authority is stalling. Additional charges relating to the Guptas are likely to be added.\nMr. Zuma is also trying to position his ex-wife, Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, to take over as president in 2019 when his second term ends, most likely in the hope that she will grant him a pardon.\nThe opposition parties are demanding that Mr. Zuma step down now. But it is unlikely that any party will secure an outright majority in 2019; instead, the opposition parties will gang up against the A.N.C. and form coalitions in some provinces. They have already done so in three major metropolitan areas where the A.N.C. failed to get a majority in the last local election.\nFor too long Mr. Zuma has fostered a culture of arrogance and impunity among the ruling elite, and for too long the decay has continued unabated. South Africa must change course, before a troubled democracy is reduced to a thugocracy.\n'

aS'PHNOM PENH, Cambodia \xe2\x80\x94 Kem Sokha, the leader of the opposition Cambodia National Rescue Party (C.N.R.P.), was \n during the early hours of Sept. 3, reportedly without a warrant and in violation of his parliamentary immunity. Dozens of police officers surrounded his home in Phnom Penh, while a group of armed men forced their way inside.\nHe has since been charged with treason \xe2\x80\x94 and with \n with foreigners to overthrow the Hun Sen government \xe2\x80\x94 based on a 2013 speech in which he described wanting to bring peaceful, democratic change to Cambodia and receiving advice from American experts. On Monday, during a session that the C.N.R.P. boycotted, the National Assembly \n to allow the case against Mr. Kem Sokha to proceed, implicitly lifting his immunity.\nGovernment-aligned media have named more purported participants in the spurious plot, intensifying the already palpable fear that anyone in our party, or anyone seen as supporting it, could be the government\xe2\x80\x99s next target. Several legislators who are senior members of the C.N.R.P. have left the country after being called co-conspirators.\nThe independent media, for their part, are being wiped out. The government is invoking specious tax bills or contractual violations to muzzle outlets like The Cambodia Daily, Voice of America, Radio Free Asia and Voice of Democracy, which have a history of reporting on controversial issues like expropriation, deforestation and government corruption.\nLast month, the local office of the National Democratic Institute, an American pro-democracy nonprofit organization, was abruptly \n. Other NGOs are being threatened or bullied into silence.\nOver the past several years, a spate of laws has been passed \xe2\x80\x94 over objections from the C.N.R.P. and civil society groups \xe2\x80\x94 restricting the legitimate activities of political parties, trade unions and NGOs and associations. The assassination of the outspoken political analyst Kem Ley over a year ago has yet to be properly investigated.\nThe ruling Cambodian People\xe2\x80\x99s Party is cracking down ahead of the general election scheduled for next year because it fears for its prospects then. In the \n in 2013, the C.P.P. won 68 seats in the National Assembly \xe2\x80\x94 down from 90 \xe2\x80\x94 and the C.N.R.P. won 55, a record for an opposition party. We also made impressive gains in local elections in June, winning control of \n \xe2\x80\x94 up from the combined 40 communes (out of 1,633) won in the 2012 local elections by the two opposition parties that later merged to form the C.N.R.P.\nThese results may seem modest, but they are remarkable considering the C.P.P.\xe2\x80\x99s lock on state resources and the increasingly repressive political climate in Cambodia. And they prove that the C.N.R.P. appeals not only to the educated and the urban, but also to the rural poor, long the beneficiaries of the C.P.P.\xe2\x80\x99s vast patronage networks.\nIf convicted of treason, Mr. Kem Sokha faces up to 30 years in prison. Under recent revisions to the law on political parties \xe2\x80\x94 which ban parties from having leaders with criminal records \xe2\x80\x94 the C.N.R.P. would then be dissolved. These legal changes have already forced the C.N.R.P.\xe2\x80\x99s former president, Sam Rainsy, to resign because he is the subject of several (dubious) defamation cases.\nThe government\xe2\x80\x99s game is transparent. If Mr. Kem Sokha stays at the helm of the C.N.R.P., the party risks being dismantled. If he steps down, more bogus charges will be brought against our next leader \xe2\x80\x94 and then the next. Succumbing to the C.P.P.\xe2\x80\x99s threat to disband us unless we abandon our current leadership would be a grave political error. We refuse to be complicit in this assault on democracy.\nC.N.R.P. members and lawmakers have weathered various onslaughts before, including arbitrary arrests and beatings at the hands of the prime minister\xe2\x80\x99s \n. We have stood our ground out of faith in the power of the democratic process. Should our party be dissolved, the next general election would be a farce, and the next government, a fraud.\nOur resolve is steadfast, but we need all the help we can get. We have been heartened by the support of governments, lawmakers and organizations around the world \xe2\x80\x94 the \n, \n, \n, \n \xe2\x80\x94 that have criticized Mr. Kem Sokha\xe2\x80\x99s unjustified arrest. Yet we need concrete help, too.\nThe Hun Sen government may feel emboldened to crack down on all forms of opposition, even at the risk of alienating its partners in the West, because China has lavished military aid and investments on Cambodia in recent years: According to an \n published in The Economist earlier this year, Chinese money accounted for 70 percent of total industrial investment in Cambodia between 2011 and 2015. But Western countries still have leverage here.\nBetween about 30 percent and 40 percent of the Cambodian government\xe2\x80\x99s budget is still covered by foreign development assistance, including from European Union countries, the United States, Canada, Australia, Japan and South Korea. Cambodia also benefits from preferential trade terms, such as most-favored-nation status with the United States and under the European Union\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cEverything But Arms\xe2\x80\x9d initiative. The top destinations for Cambodia\xe2\x80\x99s exports are the United States, Britain and Germany.\nWestern governments should use this economic leverage to urge the Hun Sen administration to respect Cambodians\xe2\x80\x99 political freedoms, setting clear conditions and red lines for further budget assistance and further preferential trade access that would require the protection of human rights.\nThe private sector also has a role to play, particularly large companies involved with Cambodia\xe2\x80\x99s garment sector. Textiles and footwear account for 80 percent of the country\xe2\x80\x99s total export revenue, and some 700,000 jobs. Major buyers like H&M, Adidas and Zara have managed to influence government policy in Cambodia in the past, including to secure a higher minimum wage and various protections for workers in the garment industry. Now they should use their clout to help protect democracy in Cambodia. After all, doing so would also help protect the stability of the country and, by the same token, their business interests.\nThe Cambodian people are hungry for political change. They \n during the general election in 2013, and again in local elections a few months ago. I see it and hear it whenever I speak to my constituents in the western province of Battambang. They ask for more jobs, fair wages, decent prices for their crops, access to health care and relief from the crushing weight of microcredit loans.\nCambodia\xe2\x80\x99s voters must be allowed to choose their leaders next year in a process that is free and fair, and credible. Mr. Kem Sokha must be freed \xe2\x80\x94 immediately and unconditionally.\n'

aS'MOSCOW \xe2\x80\x94 At the beginning of August, five members of a gang accused of murdering 17 people during robberies on highways around the Moscow area were facing trial at Moscow Regional Court. While the five men were being escorted to the courtroom, they \n, seized their weapons and opened fire in the courthouse. Most likely this terrible episode could have been avoided had there been adequate security, but the five defendants were accompanied by only two armed guards.\nThere were no such incidents later in the month when \n, a theater director, arrived in court for a hearing. The defendant, a young man in a baseball cap, was escorted into the courtroom by five armed special forces agents. If you were watching the scene, you might think Mr. Serebrennikov was an extremely dangerous criminal, rather than a theater director accused of embezzling \n of state money.\nMr. Serebrennikov\xe2\x80\x99s arrest last month shocked the Russian public. Several hundred of the director\xe2\x80\x99s supporters gathered outside the courthouse, and people are issuing statements of support, writing open letters and circulating petitions \xe2\x80\x94 \n was signed by the actress Cate Blanchett.\nThe official version in the indictment raises many questions. One of the accusations prosecutors made during early hearings has to do with Mr. Serebrennikov\xe2\x80\x99s staging of Shakespeare\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cA Midsummer Night\xe2\x80\x99s Dream,\xe2\x80\x9d for which his theater received state culture funds. The prosecution contends that Mr. Serebrennikov failed to mount the production. When publicity posters for the show and newspaper reviews of it were presented as evidence in court, one of the prosecutors said that he does not believe what he reads in the papers.\nMr. Serebrennikov\xe2\x80\x99s arrest seems less bizarre when put into context. In recent years, Russian officials have said that if an artist receives state funding, then he must do only what is in the state\xe2\x80\x99s interest. Dmitri S. Peskov, a spokesman for President Vladimir V. Putin, put it plainly last year: \xe2\x80\x9cIf the state gives money for a production, the state has the right to determine its theme.\xe2\x80\x9d The Russian state\xe2\x80\x99s taste runs toward films, performances and exhibitions dedicated to the heroic past of the Russian Empire or the Soviet Union. Mr. Serebrennikov, as one of the leaders of the theatrical avant-garde, is like a fifth wheel in the new official cultural value system of Mr. Putin\xe2\x80\x99s Russia.\nIn recent years, arrests in Russia have often given the impression of being politically motivated. But until now, cultural figures have been spared. Before Mr. Serebrennikov, the most famous theater director to be imprisoned was Vsevolod Meyerhold, who was arrested under orders from Stalin and shot in 1940 and to whom Mr. Serebrennikov is now being compared.\nThis might seem like an exaggeration \xe2\x80\x94 after all, Mr. Serebrennikov was put under house arrest, which is not quite the same as being shot to death. But the comparison seems apt if you take note that both Meyerhold and Mr. Serebrennikov were not necessarily dissidents or standard-bearers of artistic freedom.\nDuring the early years of Soviet power, Meyerhold was the most important official theater director. He celebrated Communist power and even contributed to the repression of other directors. Five or 10 years ago, Mr. Serebrennikov, too, was in favor with the Russian authorities. He staged a play, \xe2\x80\x9c\n,\xe2\x80\x9d based on a novel reportedly by Vladislav Surkov, an aide to Mr. Putin. He also organized a Kremlin-supported arts festival called Territory. Five years ago, he became artistic director of the Gogol Center, a state theater. He really is more like Meyerhold than, say, \n, or the other dissident artists who battled the Kremlin.\nIn May, when Mr. \n, Yevgeny Mironov, the artistic director of Moscow\xe2\x80\x99s Theater of Nations, presented Mr. Putin with a letter supporting Mr. Serebrennikov. This took place at a ceremony in the Kremlin, when the president was presenting awards to loyal figures in the arts, including Mr. Mironov. When he took the letter, Mr. Putin was heard saying, \xe2\x80\x9cFools.\xe2\x80\x9d At the time, some thought the president was reproaching the investigators and prosecutors. Now it seems that the president had in mind people in the theater community who still believe that they can work with the Kremlin.\nAfter Mr. Serebrennikov\xe2\x80\x99s arrest, Ivan Vyrypaev, a well-known Russian playwright and director, wrote \n in the arts not to accept money or awards from the Kremlin, and not to publicly shake Mr. Putin\xe2\x80\x99s hand. This appeal doesn\xe2\x80\x99t seem to have gone very far. Marina Davydova, an influential theater critic who had organized a campaign in support of Mr. Serebrennikov, wrote on Facebook: \xe2\x80\x9cIf the regime decides to support contemporary composers, new cinema and a festival that attracts the European theater elite, why should we not cooperate with such a regime?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 as though it were irrelevant that this same regime is engaged in a war of repression against its opponents.\nThis is the most unpleasant conclusion to draw from Mr. Serebrennikov\xe2\x80\x99s situation. Even now, with the regime speaking to artists for the first time in the language of arrests and trials, there is practically no one in the Russian cultural community willing to stand up to the government. These artists have no desire for confrontation; they want to play a loyalist role that allows them relative freedom.\nUntil recently, Mr. Putin seemed inclined to replicate the approach to the arts that the Kremlin took in the 1970s. During that time, despite totalitarianism, Soviet film studios managed to produce the director \n work, and Moscow theaters staged productions that fell outside official cultural policy. The situation now is not as harsh as it was during the Stalin years, but it is headed in that direction. Mr. Putin demands absolute loyalty.\nAleksei Uchitel, a film director who signed an appeal in 2014 supporting the annexation of Crimea, is now in trouble over his new film, \xe2\x80\x9c\n.\xe2\x80\x9d Putin loyalists in Parliament and some regional leaders, including \n, are calling for the film to be banned because it depicts a love affair between Czar Nicholas II and the ballerina Matilda Kshesinskaya. The church considers the czar to be a saint, and a saint shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be portrayed as having affairs. Until now, Russian directors, actors and writers have not understood that as the authoritarian system continues to tighten its grip, they will face a choice: either become dissidents or agree to work under the regime\xe2\x80\x99s direct control.\n'

aS'NEW ORLEANS \xe2\x80\x94 The wind isn\xe2\x80\x99t racist, and the rain doesn\xe2\x80\x99t target the poor. But when hurricanes strike and cities flood, people who were already disadvantaged tend to suffer the most. That\xe2\x80\x99s because the wind and rain alone do not define the shape of our modern disasters.\nAs legislators in Texas, Florida and Washington, D.C., begin to set the course for the recoveries from Hurricanes Harvey and Irma, they should avoid the allure of easy fixes that maintain inequality or policies that make it worse. Instead, they should use federal and state recovery aid to encourage more equal communities.\nNew Orleanians know too well that recovery policies matter at least as much as the storm itself in determining a city\xe2\x80\x99s fate. When I ask people to tell me their Katrina stories for a book I\xe2\x80\x99m writing about the disaster, their answers are never confined to the day the storm made landfall. Many people barely mention the hurricane at all.\nMy neighbors tell me about the city before the storm and the difficulty of evacuating. They speak with rage about the shoddy levee system: It was the Army Corps\xe2\x80\x99s failure, not the 2005 hurricane, that flooded the city. They talk about feeling abandoned, left to drown in the world\xe2\x80\x99s most powerful country. They mourn the loss of family members and friends.\nThey tell me about weeks of waiting to learn what had happened to their houses, and when or whether they would be able to return home. They talk about FEMA trailers laced with formaldehyde. They talk about the state\xe2\x80\x99s decision to close the public Charity Hospital, which by and large was not damaged by the storm. They talk about the stress.\nThey talk about a recovery program, subcontracted to a for-profit company for the sake of efficiency, that took three years to distribute many recovery grants. They tell me of their anguish over debates about whether New Orleanians had a so-called right of return to their homes or whether some places were too vulnerable to rebuild. They talk about the struggle over who should decide. A lot of people talk about Feb. 7, 2010, when the Saints won the Super Bowl.\nTheir answers teach me that when historians write about Hurricanes Harvey and Irma, the wind and rain are likely to be a comparatively small part of the story. Instead, what \xe2\x80\x9cHarvey\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cIrma\xe2\x80\x9d comes to mean will be defined by decisions that lie ahead.\nDamaged homes will have to be rebuilt with insurance and federal aid. How much money will people get? Will renters be eligible? What about people who were homeless before the storm? Will recovery work pay a living wage?\nThe answers to questions like these will determine the future of Texas and Florida, starting with the fundamental fact of who will be able to go home.\nThat certainly was the case in New Orleans. Today, while the city\xe2\x80\x99s white population has largely recovered since 2005, approximately 100,000 fewer African-Americans live here than did before Katrina. This stark racial disparity cannot be explained by the flood alone, which discriminated less than many people realize. Rather, political power and policy decisions account for the dramatic change.\nSome of those decisions were bold and public. As protesters were tear-gassed and stun-gunned outside of City Hall, for example, the legislators voted to demolish 4,500 public housing apartments, nearly all home to African-Americans.\n\xe2\x80\x9cOur residents deserve better, much better than what we offered before,\xe2\x80\x9d said the City Council president, Arnie Fielkow, which may have been true. But a housing official\xe2\x80\x99s claim that \xe2\x80\x9cKatrina has come in and washed it away\xe2\x80\x9d was certainly not. The brick buildings still stood and could easily have been reopened. Five years after the storm, fewer than half of the families who once called those places home had returned to New Orleans.\nOther decisions were more opaque, though their effects were just as profound.\nTake a detail buried within what stands as America\xe2\x80\x99s largest housing recovery program, which Louisiana called Road Home. The government paid out grants to flooded homeowners according to the so-called fair market value of their houses, rather than the replacement value. Because of historically racist practices of underdevelopment and discrimination, this seemingly race-neutral policy meant that for comparable damage, homeowners in white neighborhoods were paid more than homeowners in African-American neighborhoods. African-American homeowners sued and forced changes in the program, but the resolution did not come until six years after the storm. For many families, it was too late to matter.\nIn fact, few people got enough from Road Home to replace the homes they lost, but the racial disparity in resources available to rebuild was vast. In the predominantly white, middle-class neighborhood of Lakeview, the average gap between the cost of repairs and the amount homeowners received in private insurance and Road Home funds was $44,000. But in the mostly African-American, middle-class neighborhood of New Orleans East, the average gap was $69,000.\nIn this way, Katrina cost African-Americans more than it cost whites.\nSome scholars argue that disasters replicate social inequality, but that\xe2\x80\x99s not it, exactly. When cities flood, our actions often create and re-create inequality. But the same is true even when there is no flood. Even though inequality can sometimes seem like the natural order of things, acts of God, as some call them, are deeply embedded in the acts of women and men.\nThere have been calls not to \xe2\x80\x9cpoliticize\xe2\x80\x9d the recent storms. We heard the same thing after Hurricane Katrina. But rather than closing our eyes to the political decisions that shape our communities, we should open them wide. A disaster without politics would be an event without a history, a catastrophe without a cause. It would have nothing to teach us about how to rebuild this time, or how to prevent the disaster next time.\nIn the days after Hurricane Katrina, many people in positions of power asserted that New Orleans should not be rebuilt, as if abandoning this city would somehow solve the problems Katrina had posed.\nThose barbs still sting here, especially as Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and other frighteningly similar events across the country have made clear what many New Orleanians always understood: that New Orleans\xe2\x80\x99s history is America\xe2\x80\x99s history, and that Katrina is America\xe2\x80\x99s possible future.\nThe metropolitan sprawl that made single-family homes affordable and vulnerable, the National Flood Insurance Program that has perversely subsidized construction in flood-prone areas, the infrastructure that is not up to the challenge of a warming world, the racist fear that rends our communities, the crushing inequality and the sometimes reckless, sometimes revolutionary, hope that the future might be better than the past \xe2\x80\x94 none of these is unique to Louisiana or the Gulf Coast. They define the United States in the 21st century.\nThe \xe2\x80\x9cwe\xe2\x80\x9d who get to decide these things is rarely the \xe2\x80\x9cwe\xe2\x80\x9d who are most affected by the decisions. The suffering that our collective actions impose upon some people, followed often by the blinding insistence that their vulnerability was somehow fair, or natural, or inevitable, is not the cause or consequence of some external disaster. It is the disaster itself.\n'

aS'Republicans \xe2\x80\x94 like President Trump, for instance \xe2\x80\x94 love to puff up their chests, grasp their lapels and declaim in foghorn voices about their devotion to law and order.\nAnd so, on Tuesday, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, piously declared that the Justice Department should consider whether James Comey had broken the law before and after Trump fired him as director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think if there\xe2\x80\x99s ever a moment where we feel someone\xe2\x80\x99s broken the law, particularly if they\xe2\x80\x99re the head of the F.B.I., I think that\xe2\x80\x99s something that certainly should be looked at,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. She was referring to Comey\xe2\x80\x99s exoneration of Hillary Clinton in the email caper, and his admission that he had leaked his own private memo describing conversations with Trump.\nIt couldn\xe2\x80\x99t get clearer than that, right? Not so fast.\nOn a Friday night in August, when Hurricane Harvey was barreling into Texas, Trump \n, the former Maricopa County, Ariz.a, sheriff who had blatantly violated a court order to stop detaining people because he thought they looked Mexican.\nIt didn\xe2\x80\x99t bother President Law and Order that he undercut the courts\xe2\x80\x99 only power to enforce their orders. His praise of Arpaio as being \xe2\x80\x9cvery strong\xe2\x80\x9d on lawbreaking by border crossers did not mention that the former sheriff fed his victims rotten food in outdoor detention camps where temperatures soared and some prisoners even died. Or that he failed to investigate about \n.\nUnder the Trump formula, Comey should be investigated by the Justice Department \xe2\x80\x94 but Michael Flynn, who had to resign in disgrace as national security adviser, should get a pass for lying to Vice President Mike Pence about his meetings with the Russian ambassador. On Wednesday, we learned that Democrats in Congress are asking questions about another memory slip by Flynn \xe2\x80\x94 failing to disclose a trip he took in 2015 to try to broker a Saudi-Russian deal on nuclear power plants \xe2\x80\x94 and that he may have lobbied inside the White House for that deal.\nBecause in Trump World, Flynn is a \xe2\x80\x9cgood\xe2\x80\x9d guy, while Comey is not \xe2\x80\x94 and, that\xe2\x80\x99s what this is all about. It\xe2\x80\x99s a dark, twisted version of the \xe2\x80\x9cnaughty and nice lists,\xe2\x80\x9d as reimagined by someone whose heart is at least two sizes too small.\nThus, Hillary Clinton should be \xe2\x80\x9clocked up\xe2\x80\x9d for her witless handling of her email server years ago, but Donald Trump Jr. should not be called to account for meeting last year with Kremlin agents to get \xe2\x80\x9cdirt\xe2\x80\x9d on Clinton, or later telling tall tales about the meeting.\nThe Trump Naughty list covers all undocumented immigrants (including those brought here as children) from Latin America and refugees of most kinds, especially Muslims.\nThen there are the Americans who visited a website that organized protests against Trump after the election. The Justice Department wants their internet addresses \xe2\x80\x94 1.3 million of them \xe2\x80\x94 and a District of Columbia judge in Washington \n with the ridiculous argument that he would review the information to protect \xe2\x80\x9cinnocent\xe2\x80\x9d people. That would be all 1.3 million.\nSo their constitutional rights should be trampled in Trumpland. Yet we should respect those of the armed thugs who gathered in Charlottesville, Va., to defend symbols of racism in American history.\nThe law-and-order president wants to target journalists who cover his administration in ways he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t like, subjecting them to leak investigations and, he has darkly hinted, perhaps a curtailment of their First Amendment rights.\nThe global Naughty List includes Kim Jong-un of North Korea, who should be there. But it excludes other bloodthirsty autocrats, like Rodrigo Duterte of the Philippines, Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey, Abdel Fattah el-Sisi of Egypt, the Saudi royal family and Vladimir Putin.\nTrump this week welcomed \n, who is under investigation by the Justice Department for corruption.\nTrump, of course, has his priorities straight. The Razak visit, he said, was about \xe2\x80\x9cvery large trade deals\xe2\x80\x9d and Malaysia\xe2\x80\x99s status as a \xe2\x80\x9cmassive investor\xe2\x80\x9d in this country. Razak, no doubt by sheer coincidence, stayed at the Trump hotel in Washington.\nReally, the Nice List is not so mysterious. To get on it, be a member of Trump\xe2\x80\x99s family, support him with unquestioning and sycophantic loyalty, rule your country through blood and fear \xe2\x80\x94 or just throw money his way.\n'

aS'In over 45 years of  working in global affairs, I\xe2\x80\x99ve observed a simple truth: America\xe2\x80\x99s ability to lead the world depends not just on the example of our power, but on the power of our example.\nAmerican democracy is rooted in the belief that every man, woman and child has equal rights to freedom and dignity. While the United States is far from perfect, we have never given up the struggle to grow closer to the ideals in our founding documents.\nThe constant American endeavor to live by our values is a great strength that has drawn generations of strivers and dreamers to the United States, enriching our population. Around the world, other nations follow our lead because they know that America does not simply protect its own interests, but tries to advance the aspirations of all.\nThis has stood as the foundation of American foreign policy throughout my political career \xe2\x80\x94 until recently.\nAround the world, including in the United States, we are seeing the resurgence of a worldview that is closed off and clannish. President Trump keeps longstanding allies such as Germany at arm\xe2\x80\x99s length, while expressing admiration for autocrats like Vladimir V. Putin who thwart democratic institutions.\nRather than building from a narrative of freedom and democracy that inspires nations to rally together, this White House casts global affairs as a zero-sum competition \xe2\x80\x94 for the United States to succeed, others must lose. Among the many problems that plague the Trump administration\xe2\x80\x99s foreign policy, this line of thinking is perhaps the most disturbing.\nDuring \n in July, Mr. Trump said, \xe2\x80\x9cThe fundamental question of our time is whether the West has the will to survive.\xe2\x80\x9d This statement divides the world into \xe2\x80\x9cus\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cthem.\xe2\x80\x9d No American political figure has so narrowly defined our interests since the period between the world wars.\nMr. Trump\xe2\x80\x99s shameful \n of the white nationalists and neo-Nazis who unleashed hatred and violence in \n, further abnegated America\xe2\x80\x99s moral leadership. Not since the Jim Crow era has an American president so misunderstood and misrepresented our values.\nMost recently, the Trump administration\xe2\x80\x99s order to rescind Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals \xe2\x80\x94 punishing young people brought to this country by their parents, many of whom know no home but the United States \xe2\x80\x94 betrays an unnecessary cruelty that further undermines America\xe2\x80\x99s standing in the world.\nWhen \n said that it was important to \xe2\x80\x9cunderstand the difference between policy and values,\xe2\x80\x9d he wrote off the very thing that makes the United States exceptional. And at a time when democratic values are under siege around the globe \xe2\x80\x94 from populist attacks that undermine confidence in democratic institutions to leaders who try to bolster their power by closing the space for civil society and rolling back citizens\xe2\x80\x99 rights \xe2\x80\x94 the world cannot afford to have America cede the field to illiberalism and intolerance.\nPlacing American democratic values back at the center of our foreign policy does not mean we should impose our principles abroad or refuse to talk with nations whose policies run counter to them. There will always be times when keeping Americans safe requires working with those whom we find distasteful. But even when we must make those hard choices, we can never forget who we are and the future we seek.\nReclaiming our values starts with standing up for them at home \xe2\x80\x94 inclusivity, tolerance, diversity, respect for the rule of law, freedom of speech, freedom of the press. If these are the democratic principles we wish to see around the world, America must be the first to model them.\nThese are also the values that tie us to our closest allies \xe2\x80\x94 the friends we depend on to address major global challenges. They must believe that the United States will continue to support them and to stand up for democracy.\nLeading with our values also means that we speak out when nations violate their citizens\xe2\x80\x99 rights. If leaders repress their own people, we must make clear that it constrains our ability to cooperate with them. We can meet our security imperatives without giving a green light to dictators who abuse universal human rights.\nFinally, a foreign policy built on our values must stand firm against foreign powers that celebrate a perceived withdrawal of American leadership as an opportunity to increase their influence. Without the United States standing as a bulwark for global democracy, illiberal powers like Russia will take increasingly aggressive steps to disrupt the international order, bully their neighbors and return to a more divided world.\nFrom the Marshall Plan after World War II to our alliances in East Asia, both Republican and Democratic officials have long embraced a vision of American leadership that fosters a more secure, inclusive and generous planet. That ideal made the world safer and more prosperous \xe2\x80\x94 for Americans and everyone else.\nThe international community still needs a strong, democratic America leading the way. And the good news is that the United States remains better positioned than any other country to shape the direction of the 21st century. But to succeed, we cannot abandon the tenets that we fought so hard to defend over the past seven decades \xe2\x80\x94 ideals that magnified American leadership and produced the greatest increase in global prosperity in history.\nYou cannot define Americans by what they look like, where they come from, whom they love or how they worship. Only our democratic values define us. And if we lose sight of this in our conduct at home or abroad, we jeopardize the respect that has made the United States the greatest nation on earth.\n'

aS'The Federal Reserve arguably has more influence on the daily lives of Americans than any other government agency. In the coming year President Trump has a chance to appoint or replace five of the central bank\xe2\x80\x99s seven governors, including the vice chairman, Stanley Fischer, and possibly the chairwoman, Janet Yellen.\nFew presidents have had so many seats to fill this quickly, and it\xe2\x80\x99s time to pay attention to how Mr. Trump will use the opportunity. The heavy hitters vying for seats are talking \xe2\x80\x94 often vaguely \xe2\x80\x94 about reforming the Fed, which has been praised for preventing a depression after the financial crisis of 2008, but questioned for failing to anticipate the crisis itself.\nThe Fed missed the crisis in part because it has a dual mandate to keep unemployment and consumer price inflation low \xe2\x80\x94 and both were low before 2008. Real reform would add a third mandate: maintaining financial stability, and in particular stabilizing prices for assets like houses and stocks, which are not counted as \xe2\x80\x9cconsumer prices\xe2\x80\x9d but now have a bigger influence on the economy.\nConsumer price inflation has largely disappeared, in part because central bankers have been fighting it effectively since the 1970s, and in part because heightened global competition began restraining prices for consumer goods from TVs to toys. Meanwhile, asset prices are getting pushed in the opposite direction.\nTo ease the Great Recession after 2008, central banks adopted zero to negative interest rates and provided huge amounts of cash, effectively giving investors free money. In a world with few barriers to the flow of capital across borders, this is spurring buying sprees, and thus bidding up prices for stocks, bonds and real estate in markets from New York to Shanghai.\nToday, global financial assets (including just stocks and bonds) are worth over $250 trillion and amount to about 330 percent of global gross domestic product, up from $12 trillion and just 110 percent in 1980. Traditionally, economists have looked for trouble in the economy to cause trouble in the markets. But the ocean of money in financial markets is now so large, it\xe2\x80\x99s possible that ripples on its surface could trigger the next big downturn.\nIn the postwar era, finance has grown enormously as a share of the global economy, often feeding debt-fueled bubbles. In 2015, the economist Alan M. Taylor and his colleagues \n going back 140 years for 17 leading economies. Before World War II, there were 78 recessions \xe2\x80\x94 including only 19 that followed a bubble in stocks or housing or both. After the war, there were 88 recessions, a vast majority of which, 62, followed a stock or housing bubble or both.\nSince 1990, every major economic shock has been preceded by a collapse in prices for houses, stocks or both, including Japan\xe2\x80\x99s crash in 1990, the Asian crisis of the late 1990s, the dot-com crash of 2000-01, and the global financial crisis of 2008.\nThe Fed has changed with the world before. After the Great Depression, it focused on fighting unemployment. Amid crippling consumer price inflation in the 1970s, it shifted its focus to fighting this scourge. Now, amid looming market bubbles from China to Norway, central bankers are tentatively starting to recognize that they can\xe2\x80\x99t ignore asset price inflation. At the Federal Open Market Committee, its key policy-making body, financial stability rarely came up before 2012 but has come up at 27 of 39 meetings since.\nOf course, even market insiders can\xe2\x80\x99t spot when asset prices are ready to crash, so skeptics say the Fed can\xe2\x80\x99t be expected to either. Better to let bubbles pop and \xe2\x80\x9cmop up\xe2\x80\x9d after. However, the painfully slow recovery from 2008 shows how ineffective mess-mopping can be: Losses after the crash tend to be much bigger than gains on the way up. The Fed need not try to predict the market\xe2\x80\x99s peak; it needs only to identify signals of crises, so that it can act early to forestall them, controlling asset price inflation by raising rates or reducing cash infusions into the economy.\nThanks to post-mortem research done since 2008, we know much more about these signals. The key is to be on alert when markets are rising much faster than the underlying economy. Normally, for example, home prices rise around 5 percent a year; the International Monetary Fund has \n that rate more than doubles in pre-crisis periods.\nAt least equally telling is the pace of increase in debt. When asset prices collapse, the owners suffer instant pain. But when debt used to buy those assets collapses, the resulting defaults ripple through banks and become a drag on the economy. The longest and deepest recessions tend to follow real estate busts, because homes are almost always purchased on credit, and during booms, so many buyers are tempted to borrow excessively for that dream house.\nNonetheless most economists \xe2\x80\x94 even conservative deficit hawks who worry about the Fed \xe2\x80\x9cblowing bubbles\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 still look mainly for economic threats to the financial markets, rather than the threat that overgrown markets pose.\nThey thus don\xe2\x80\x99t recognize fully that the world has changed, and the tail now wags the dog. Many mainstream economists still argue that the economy can\xe2\x80\x99t be overheating if consumer price inflation is quiet, and they want to keep rates lower for longer, hoping that easy money will stoke growth in the economy, and jobs, for the poor and the working class.\nHowever, since 2008, easy money has produced an unusually weak economic recovery alongside an unusually long and strong run-up in prices for stocks, bonds and housing. The rich own the fattest share of these assets, so wealth inequality is increasing. In addition, easy money is fueling monopoly power by helping entrenched companies borrow.\nLiberals who question the value of promoting monopolies and the superrich might also question their fondness for easy money. Instead, to stabilize financial markets, most favor upholding tough post-2008 regulations \xe2\x80\x94 but regulation alone can\xe2\x80\x99t contain the ocean of money in financial assets. From Australia to Canada to Sweden, central banks are keeping rates low because consumer price inflation is weak, thus fueling housing bubbles. Regulatory attempts to contain those bubbles are failing.\nCentral bankers are starting to recognize that when loose monetary policy is driving up asset prices to potentially unstable levels, it sows the seeds of a recession and hurts everyone. But only a minority are prepared to lean against the wind now. Asset prices from stocks to real estate have never been this expensive simultaneously.\nIn general, government agencies, including the Fed, change their ways only after crises. The big threat is that the Fed will fully commit to preserving financial stability only after instability in the markets has triggered the next crisis. Mr. Trump should be looking for governors who are willing to commit now.\n'

aS'Like solar eclipses and bipartisan legislation, moments of near-universal consensus are extremely rare. One such event took place on Wednesday, when a start-up named Bodega stated its intention to put its namesake \xe2\x80\x94 real-life, neighborhood corner stores \xe2\x80\x94 out of business by replacing them with unmanned pantries.\n\xe2\x80\x9cEventually, centralized shopping locations won\xe2\x80\x99t be necessary, because there will be 100,000 Bodegas spread out, with one always 100 feet away from you,\xe2\x80\x9d one of its co-founders \n Fast Company. The start-up, run by two ex-Googlers, was widely savaged across social media on the grounds that its name and business mission are culturally insensitive, morally dubious, and, perhaps worse of all, lacking in personality.\nFew things make a New Yorker defensive like an assault on bodegas. Largely immigrant-owned, they are the ultimate frills-free symbol of consumer access and gritty mini-embodiments of both the city\xe2\x80\x99s diversity and its 24/7 ethos. Bacon, egg and cheese sandwiches in the morning; basic groceries and oversized heroes in the afternoon; and, inevitably, all three of these things at 3 a.m.\nIn other words, a bodega has crucial provisions whenever you need them, judgment-free and generally at a small-to-medium markup. Alka-Seltzer, regular seltzer, Gatorade and Advil. Toilet paper and deodorant. Tampons and condoms. Last winter, a bodega on the Lower East Side \n or notoriety when it was reported that customers could order Plan B pills from it online and have them delivered to their apartments.\nBut in addition to their convenience, what make bodegas beloved are their personalities. It seems like every one of them is oddly curated: prayer candles sit next to jarred olives which are sidled up next to boxes of organic mac-and-cheese. There is no Silicon Valley algorithm clever enough to come up with those crumbly, shrink-wrapped date bars that are inevitably piled up by the cash registers.\nMichael Silber is a graphic designer who has documented more than 1,200 New York City bodegas over the past three years for \n, a project whose name is a nod to the iconic and idiosyncratic food signage outside of corner stores. \xe2\x80\x9cFor me, bodegas and deli groceries really encapsulate the character and culture of a neighborhood,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Silber noted in an email. \xe2\x80\x9cEach has its own delicacies or quirks, whether it be a famous chopped cheese sandwich, unfamiliar Polish specialty foods, or a friendly bodega cat.\xe2\x80\x9d (Further fanning the flames underneath Bodega is that the company logo is a cat, an unlawful fixture and \n of many corner stores.)\nOf course, the most meaningful difference between Wi-Fi-enabled vending machines and family-run corner stores is the human being. Corner stores aren\xe2\x80\x99t just a small compensation for living in a dense city. They also enable countless New Yorkers to begin their day with routines that are both rote and reassuring, whether it\xe2\x80\x99s a \n, a cup of coffee or a sane, friendly encounter across a checkout counter.\nA well-cultivated, strategic relationship with your bodega can mean that you might have a safe place for your spare keys and packages. If you\xe2\x80\x99re really lucky, the clerks will share their life stories with you, tell you about all the ways you\xe2\x80\x99re screwing up your romantic life, and remember that you add American cheese to everything.\nMy first bodega in New York was on Eighth Avenue, where I was known as \xe2\x80\x9cHouston\xe2\x80\x9d by the staff because, well, I\xe2\x80\x99m from Houston. Of course, it was pronounced like the nearby street in Lower Manhattan rather than the city in Texas. At first, it irritated me. Then I realized that it was a way of letting me know that I had arrived.\nMany years later, my current bodega opened on my block in Brooklyn a year after I had moved in. Its shelves were still half-stocked at the grand opening. When I asked if there would be date bars, the owners told me to come back tomorrow. It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t get more high-tech than that.\n'

aS'It has been a while since an appellate-court nomination generated as much noise as last week\xe2\x80\x99s hearing for Amy Coney Barrett, a law professor at Notre Dame and a nominee to the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals. During the hearing, Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California, pressed Ms. Barrett, who is a devout Catholic, on the relationship between faith and judicial duty, which the professor had once addressed in a law review \n. In that piece, she argued that there may be occasions, such as in death penalty cases, where a judge might have to recuse herself because of a conflict between her religious beliefs and her responsibilities as a judge. \nSenator Feinstein asked Ms. Barrett about her views, and then made the following statement: \xe2\x80\x9cWhatever a religion is, it has its own dogma. The law is totally different. And I think in your case, professor, when you read your speeches, the conclusion one draws is that the dogma lives loudly within you, and that\xe2\x80\x99s of concern when you come to big issues that large numbers of people have fought for for years in this country.\xe2\x80\x9d Other Democratic senators also \n similar ideas in their own questions and statements.\nThe reaction was swift and ruthless. Noah Feldman of Harvard Law School \n because the \xe2\x80\x9cthrust of Feinstein\xe2\x80\x99s questioning was that, as a believing Catholic, Barrett couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be trusted to apply the Constitution and laws objectively.\xe2\x80\x9d Other commentators, such as Christopher L. Eisgruber, the president of Princeton, \n that Ms. Feinstein\xe2\x80\x99s comments amounted to a religious test for office.\nThe reaction to Ms. Feinstein\xe2\x80\x99s comments is understandable, but overblown. She is surely guilty of poor word choice: As Mr. Feldman noted, the term \xe2\x80\x9cdogma\xe2\x80\x9d has an ugly historical context, often used by 19th-century Protestants to express anti-Catholic bigotry. But that is an objection more to style than to substance. And on the substance, asking a nominee about her strong faith, and whether she can put her religious views aside when deciding cases that implicate those views, is nowhere close to imposing a religious test for office.\nSenator Feinstein was not suggesting that Catholics shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be judges. She was asking whether someone of deep faith and who had previously openly (and in our opinion eloquently) written about the relationship between judging and faith could cast aside her deeply held views when judging. Had Ms. Barrett said that her faith would in fact deeply influence her judging, would the question have been deemed so wrong? We think not.\nLikewise, if senators had asked Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg during her confirmation hearing if her long history litigating claims of gender discrimination would influence her judging, or if they had asked Chief Justice John Roberts whether his time working in the Bush administration would affect his decision making, no one would have blinked.\nJudges regularly decide difficult legal issues in which the law at issue is unclear. In those open spaces, a judge\xe2\x80\x99s personal values and life experiences will inevitably play a role in the outcome of the case. Given that Ms. Barrett had previously explored the relationship between her deeply held religious views and judging, Ms. Feinstein acted well within the bounds of fair questioning to probe deeply on this question.\nMoreover, the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment, which forbids government from making any law \xe2\x80\x9crespecting an establishment of religion,\xe2\x80\x9d plays a special role in this context. The potential impact of religious belief on government officials, including judges, is a matter of special concern in a nation dedicated to the separation of church and state, especially on such fundamental issues as abortion, gay rights and capital punishment.\nAs Ms. Barrett thoughtfully observed in her 1998 law review article on this subject, \xe2\x80\x9cCatholic judges must answer some complex moral and legal questions in deciding whether to sit in death penalty cases.\xe2\x80\x9d Judges, she wrote, \xe2\x80\x9ccannot \xe2\x80\x94 nor should they try to \xe2\x80\x94 align our legal system with the church\xe2\x80\x99s moral teaching whenever the two diverge.\xe2\x80\x9d\nIt was this issue that Senator Feinstein was asking about, and in light of the fact that Ms. Barrett has both written and spoken on this dilemma, it was perfectly appropriate for members of the Senate Judiciary Committee to explore this issue with her. In no way was this a \xe2\x80\x9creligious test\xe2\x80\x9d for office or an expression of anti-Catholic bigotry. It was a sensible effort to explore how Ms. Barrett would handle the \xe2\x80\x9ccomplex moral and legal question\xe2\x80\x9d that she herself had sensibly brought to the fore.\n'

aS'Back when identity theft was mainly credit card fraud and a 100,000-record leak was a big deal \xe2\x80\x94 the good old days, around 2004 \xe2\x80\x94 my hacker friends and I would sit around and brainstorm ways to slow down what some were calling the fastest-growing crime of the century.\nOne method came up again and again: Someone should steal the entire database of Social Security numbers and publish it online. (No one tried \xe2\x80\x94 that would be a crime!) Why do something so crazy? Once and for all, it would eliminate the fantasy that a Social Security number is both a unique identifier and a secret to be used as an authenticator.\nConsumers are asked for their Social Security number perhaps dozens of times each year: by banks, by utility companies, by their health care providers, by government agencies, even by websites. Every time the number is given, the odds go up that it will fall into the wrong hands. Still, America\xe2\x80\x99s identification system relies on the fantasy that these nine digits are a secret. Publication of the full Social Security number list would shatter that fantasy and force the banking industry to invent new and genuinely effective ways to protect consumers from identity thieves.\nIt seems that has finally occurred. The Equifax credit-reporting agency is being terribly, dangerously vague about its stunning loss of \n. The data belong to roughly three-quarters of Americans with a credit report. Might as well be everyone.\nWhatever the company finally admits to, this much is certain: Social Security numbers are no longer a secret.\nThese numbers were created for a single purpose: to track worker contributions to a national retirement fund. Until the 1970s, the cards even arrived printed with the warning \xe2\x80\x9cNot for identification.\xe2\x80\x9d It\xe2\x80\x99s time we heeded that warning and stopped using the number for applications of any kind. For loans, for jobs, for cellphones. It\xe2\x80\x99s going to be very expensive, but the jig is up.\nIdentity theft is an unfair shifting of costs. It has always been cheaper to avoid investment in security upgrades and instead push the real costs of this system onto victims, who spend hours cleaning up the messes left behind. They sometimes even pay a monthly fee for protection from a system they never asked to be a part of in the first place.\nThis fragile authentication arrangement based on Social Security numbers persists so that retailers and banks can offer easy credit. Walk in with a number and a name, walk out with a new TV and a credit card. As long as a credit score attached to the Social Security number listed on the application is high enough, many creditors are more than happy to make that snap decision and take the risk. Sometimes the name doesn\xe2\x80\x99t even have to match. That\xe2\x80\x99s why the former Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan \n that \xe2\x80\x9cchildren, dogs, cats and moose are getting credit cards.\xe2\x80\x9d And if a few consumers end up with ruined credit or paperwork headaches or, in extreme cases, losing their jobs or getting arrested \xe2\x80\x94 well, that\xe2\x80\x99s just the cost of doing business.\nSome security tools have made their way into the system. Companies use big data, examining public records or other background sources to see whether the address on an application matches, if the name and age make sense, and even if a particular Social Security number is making the rounds among thieves. Despite these tools, the overall incidence of identity theft hit a record high last year, \n. New-account fraud, perhaps the worst kind, spiked 20 percent last year, the firm said.\nIt doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have to be this way. You might recall that until recently, United States-based credit cards were protected only by 1960s-era magnetic stripe technology. We were at least a decade behind Europeans, who enjoyed added security from chip-enabled cards. Retailers and banks delayed and delayed, playing a game of chicken over who would pay for the costs. Then the 2013 \n took place, and now we insert instead of swipe. Results have been mixed, but at least one kind of credit card fraud, card cloning, has significantly decreased.\nThe Equifax hack could be another Target moment. It should spur industry into action and upgrade. No single technology is going to replace Social Security numbers as an identifier and a secret, and that\xe2\x80\x99s a good thing. There is security in diversity. Two-factor authentication, available from many banks, should be required for new credit. The credit bureaus themselves could develop new unique IDs for us, to be used only for credit purposes. Biometrics can be used by employers and government agencies that require high levels of security.\nSocial Security numbers were never designed to be a security tool, and their usefulness for that purpose has run its course. Just publish the whole list and be done with it. Then get on to the business of keeping our secrets a secret.\n'

aS'Looking across the globe, it might appear at times that violence, chaos and fear are getting the upper hand over order, democracy and reason.\nThe world has always been a messy place, of course, and it may be that the internet and social media give the worst of times more prominence than the best.\nBut there are real reasons for anxiety. Traditional democratic ideals and institutions are under attack. Some leaders in Eastern Europe espouse \xe2\x80\x9cilliberal\xe2\x80\x9d democracy, which treads on traditional human rights. Authoritarian leaders from Russia to Venezuela grow stronger; Kim Jong-un of North Korea defies the world in his pursuit of a doomsday weapon. And the United States under Donald Trump becomes more bitterly divided and unpredictable.\nHistorically, however, there has also been pushback, a rejection of oppression and despotism. It brought about the end of apartheid, the fall of the Berlin Wall, the Black Lives Matter movement in the United States, the acceptance of more than a million refugees in Germany.\nCountries rarely embrace democracy as their first choice; they have often tried monarchies, oligarchies or other forms of coercive government first. They come to democracy because, for all its messiness and inefficiency, it is the way to give people a voice in how they\xe2\x80\x99re governed, and to allow them to change leaders peacefully.\nBut it can never be taken for granted. It is constantly confronting challenges and threats and adapting to changing times. Those challenges will be discussed at the five-day \n this week in Athens, Greece. Now in its fifth year, the conference, convened by The New York Times, will gather global leaders to talk about the state of the world.\nIn advance of the conference, The Times solicited \n facing nations today.\n'

aS'Last week I wrote \n praising Betsy DeVos for announcing that the Department of Education would \n the Obama administration\xe2\x80\x99s 2011 \xe2\x80\x9cguidance\xe2\x80\x9d on campus sexual assault. The new guidelines, often interpreted with Procrustean severity by nervous campus administrators, had all but eliminated elementary aspects of due process for the accused.\nThe results, in far too many cases, were bad verdicts, ruined reputations and permanently damaged lives.\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s in our moral and constitutional DNA that we take extraordinary pains to safeguard the rights of the accused, even when it means letting the guilty go free. But we also believe in justice, and the fact is that sexual assault is a brutal reality of modern campus life, abetted in too many instances by a culture of binge drinking. How best to change this without compounding one injustice with another, or intruding too far into private life, or violating fundamental rights is a matter of debate. That it has to change isn\xe2\x80\x99t, or shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be.\nAfter the column\xe2\x80\x99s publication, a young friend wrote me a personal note to share her experience of being raped in college. Her letter is so detailed, devastating, honest and thoughtful that I thought the best thing to do was give her the full stage of an Op-Ed column in The Times.\nHere is her letter. She asked that her name be withheld to protect her privacy.\nDear Bret,\nI wanted to write you about your Betsy DeVos column. I found it wanting in the way I find many pieces on this subject wanting. I hope you\xe2\x80\x99ll hear me out.\nI agree with you that the current system is bad, that the guidance issued by the Obama administration should be reformed, that due process should be safeguarded. I do. In fact, I think the backlash from the bad guidance issued will make things only harder for victims of assault.\nAnd so, that being said, may I suggest a follow-up column? I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen many pieces by sensible people on the violated rights of accused rapists. I have seen zero pieces from the center-right on the rights of sexual-assault victims. I have seen zero pieces that take the problem of sexual assault seriously. The best we get is a glancing line, and then a question about statistics.\nBut if one took as a given that there was some kind of sexual assault crisis going on at the campuses \xe2\x80\x94 even one that resulted in more bad accusations along with real accusations \xe2\x80\x94 well, then, can you tell me what should be done about it that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t violate due process and that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t make it harder for the victims to come forward and get a conviction?\nIf you want to get some perspective on the issue, perhaps you could do more than look at some studies. At least give the victims the same careful attention you give the accused.\nI can be your first interview. In college, I once blacked out drunk at a party and someone offered to walk me home. I don\xe2\x80\x99t remember what happened after that, but when I woke up my clothes were on inside out. I started screaming. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know what had happened, but I did know that some part of me had died forever, and that I had been violated.\nIt had happened in my empty apartment, late at night, and no one had seen it but us. Both of us had been drinking. I was clearly incapacitated, blacked out, walked home shoeless, had bruises from falling over.\nHow does one prove I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t passed out at the time of the event itself? We were the only ones there. I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t remember enough from the night to even defend myself. What if I had said O.K.? I didn\xe2\x80\x99t learn till later that incapacitated people can\xe2\x80\x99t consent.\nAt the time I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know enough about rape laws to know that it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t my fault. And I didn\xe2\x80\x99t think that anyone would believe me even if I had been unconscious when it happened. I had no proof. Not more than 50 percent, anyway. Another girl at my college had reported a rape and had been forced to sit through peer mediation with her rapist. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to go through that. I was a strong, tough girl. The prospect of losing a case seemed worse to me than the prospect of sucking it up and moving on.\nSo I survived. I would wake up sweating from nightmares. I would call up my mom in the middle of the night hysterical and she would stay on the phone with me until I fell back asleep. I lost about 30 pounds. I would gaze into oncoming traffic as I walked to work and think about jumping in.\nIt took about a year, but I finally got myself to a place where I could talk about what happened to someone who knew better about this sort of thing. And then I wanted justice. But by that time, there was no \xe2\x80\x9cpreponderance\xe2\x80\x9d of evidence to debate. There was no evidence at all.\nIf the sexual assault crisis on college campuses shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t, and can\xe2\x80\x99t, be addressed by the Department of Education or by changing Title IX, then who can change it and how? I suspect many of the solutions to this crisis are cultural and moral rather than legal, and perhaps there isn\xe2\x80\x99t a clear policy solution. You\xe2\x80\x99re a columnist, and you care about the culture, and it\xe2\x80\x99s well within your purview to examine the moral questions of our time.\nIt seems to me that conservatives and mainstream liberals have abdicated concern about sexual assault to the far left. It\xe2\x80\x99s an astounding moral blind spot, and frankly it breaks my heart.\nIn an era where I had to choose between voting for a man who had bragged about sexual assault or a woman who had enabled a husband accused of it, in an era where we can\xe2\x80\x99t even convict Bill Cosby of sexual assault, in an era when a Brock Turner-type gets nothing but a slap on the wrist, the general public still has to be convinced that rape and sexual harassment are \nproblems. It\xe2\x80\x99s easy to believe there\xe2\x80\x99s an epidemic of \naccusations, but not that there\xe2\x80\x99s too much sexual assault. It\xe2\x80\x99s a cognitive dissonance I can\xe2\x80\x99t explain with any charity.\nI know in my bones that Brock Turner got convicted only because he assaulted that girl in public. If it had happened like it had happened to me, in an empty house, with no one to see \xe2\x80\x94 if there had been no photos \xe2\x80\x94 that boy would have walked away with nothing at all. He would have been as unscathed as the one who raped me.\nI have helped too many of my friends recover from similar stories to question whether or not this country has a sexual-assault problem. Campuses are a funny focal point, of course. I am sure it is worse for poor women, uneducated women, those outside the bubble of privileged young people at elite institutions. But it still happens on campuses.\nI hate having to use my own life as an example. But honestly, so many of the conservative men in my life won\xe2\x80\x99t listen to me on this argument until I tell them my story. So here I am. I was raped. He got away with it, because I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know enough to do everything right and because I was a \xe2\x80\x9cbad victim.\xe2\x80\x9d I had been drinking. I had no witnesses. There was nothing the law could do for me.\nSo yes, some boys have been kicked out of college unjustly, or put through a bad system and been traumatized by it. But my rapist walks free. Many others do as well. What can be done for the next girl who wakes up with her clothes inside out and her world ripped apart?\n'

aS'I will never forget the morning of June 26, 2013. I was in the living room of my apartment in Los Angeles when my girlfriend told me, \xe2\x80\x9cWe won.\xe2\x80\x9d\nWe cried. We turned on the news. We sent texts. We cried more. We got back in bed and took selfies of our joy and disbelief.\nWe had speakerphone conversations with our parents, then arguments about needing a break from the phone. And we stared at the now iconic photo of 84-year-old Edith Windsor running down the steps of the Supreme Court, arms held above her head, pink and orange scarf billowing in the breeze like some kind of knight who just vanquished a dragon. Edie, who died Tuesday, was our knight. A white-haired knight who swore a lot and was partial to pearls.\nTwo days after the court ruling, which overturned the Defense of Marriage Act, I asked Cameron to marry me. She said yes \xe2\x80\x94 for me, a win on the level of Edie\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x94 and became my fianc\xc3\xa9e, though we both preferred to call each other Beyonc\xc3\xa9s. We do the same job, standup comedy, and we spent those two years traveling the country doing shows together: I opened and she headlined.\nI didn\xe2\x80\x99t keep an accurate track of how many cities and towns we played over those two years between Edie Windsor\xe2\x80\x99s victory and June 26, 2015, when marriage equality became the law of the land, but it was a lot, at least 100. Some towns and cities were in states or regions that had passed religious liberty acts, which allowed for employers and service providers refuse to serve, employ or rent to people based on the sexual identity (or people they might \n were L.G.B.T.Q.I.A., for that matter) so long as that identity was against the employer, service provider or landlord\xe2\x80\x99s religion. Audience members would wait to meet us after our shows and thank us for making them laugh because they drove three hours from downstate Indiana or rural Texas. One woman came to our show in Ft. Wayne, Ind. She told us she really needed the laugh that night because she had just been fired for being gay. How did she know that\xe2\x80\x99s why she was fired? Because her employer told her.\nAs a community, we would spend the next three years celebrating wins like the Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s Obergefell v. Hodges decision, which guaranteed the right to marry regardless of sexual identity, but also dealing with near daily attacks on our rights in \xe2\x80\x9csmaller\xe2\x80\x9d arenas, like North Carolina\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cbathroom bill.\xe2\x80\x9d Every time our community leapt forward, it would feel undermined by 10 smaller steps backward. Then Orlando happened. The attack on one of the Florida city\xe2\x80\x99s gay night clubs, Pulse, left 49 dead and 58 wounded. It was the deadliest terrorist attack in the United States since 9/11.\nFour days after the attack, I flew to New York to play a benefit show for Hillary Clinton. Cameron had been booked, too, but we decided she would stay home in Los Angeles to finish editing our television show \xe2\x80\x9cTake My Wife,\xe2\x80\x9d which was to have its premiere a month later. It was (and is) the first sitcom created by and starring an out, married queer couple \xe2\x80\x94 a show that would have been inconceivable without United States v. Windsor.\nI had enough time before the show to go to the Stonewall Inn, where a crowd had gathered to mourn Orlando. I hugged strangers and wept openly. I listened to Whitney Houston\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cI Wanna Dance With Somebody\xe2\x80\x9d and thought of all the people, \n people, gunned down in a club where\xe2\x80\x99d they come just to dance with someone who loved them. I thought of all my brothers and sisters and siblings who, throughout history, had come in and out of the door of the Stonewall Inn, many of whom were never able to come out and lead full lives, let alone marry the person they love.\nThat night at the benefit, which was organized by a lesbian-run political action committee, I met some my heroes: Marsha Warfield, Kate Clinton, Rosie O\xe2\x80\x99Donnell and Alison Bechdel, who told me the first gay bar she ever went to was in my hometown. I had heard that Edie Windsor was there and at the after party, I spotted her from across the room. In that moment, I felt that same connection I had felt earlier in the day at Stonewall. Edie was more than a hero for me and young L.G.B.T.Q.I.A. people across the country. She was a matriarch in our ancestry; a strong branch in our family tree.\nI immediately noticed how tiny she was. She reminded me of my own grandmother, who had passed away at 88 years old, a tough woman who had been pushed down \xe2\x80\x94 she literally lost inches \xe2\x80\x94 on account of the burdens she carried. I realized how much weight Edie carried in \n life, through the 42 years she spent engaged but not legally married to her love, Thea Spyer, who died of multiple sclerosis in 2009. I noticed she wore running shoes: a fitting choice for a woman who never seemed to stop moving.\nHer partner, Judith Kasen, grabbed me and asked me if I wanted to say hi. I told her I could tell Edie seemed tired and ready to leave and that I didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to bother her. She told me it was no bother. We chatted for a bit, about the show and other things. Judith told me that during my set Edie leaned over and told her I was her type. I am sure I turned as red as the scarf Edie wore on those Supreme Court steps three years before.\nJudith introduced us and I shook Edie\xe2\x80\x99s hand. I showed her my wedding ring and said \xe2\x80\x9cthank you.\xe2\x80\x9d She beamed and said something to me, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t remember what because my brain was too busy realizing I was standing next to Edie Windsor. We took one photo together, she and Judith left, and I wandered over to some friends that had come to the show, stunned that I had just met the woman who gave me my television show, my marriage and my life.\n'

aS'Pakistan is home to many Islamist terrorist groups. Some enjoy a permissive environment despite technically being banned by the state. This has enabled them to acquire political power. Politicians sometimes court terrorist leaders to turn out voters.\nWhile researching counterterrorism a few summers ago, I met with a high-ranking Pakistani official to talk about his decision to attend a campaign rally with the leader of a proscribed terrorist organization. He admitted that getting the terrorist leader to turn out voters for a politician was his motivation. He also suggested that encouraging such men get into politics was better than seeing them remain involved in terrorism.\nI thought of that conversation last week when Pakistan\xe2\x80\x99s election commission \n to recognize the Muslim Milli League, a new political party started by the social welfare arm of Lashkar-e-Taiba, the militant group notorious for the 2008 Mumbai attacks that killed 166 people. The election commission also warned independent candidates for office not to use the party\xe2\x80\x99s name in campaigns.\nIf the commission had recognized the Muslim Milli League, that would have in effect allowed a terrorist organization to contest elections. It could have opened the door for other militant groups in Pakistan \xe2\x80\x94 and several militant groups were already gearing up to establish their own political parties.\nPakistan has a long history of political parties using violence to prevail in elections. Some parties have armed wings. Others rely on associated militias and criminal networks. Religious parties with ties to terrorist groups have contested elections for decades. Members of outlawed terrorist organizations have also won elected office as independent candidates. While no such organization had ever started its own party, Lashkar-e-Taiba and its social welfare wing, Jamaat-ud-Dawa, appeared well positioned to lead the charge.\nOn the advice of Inter-Services Intelligence Directorate, Pakistan\xe2\x80\x99s powerful spy agency, the group has changed its name several times since the Sept. 11 attacks to evade sanctions and escape bans.\nThe Pakistani government still differentiates between Lashkar-e-Taiba, which is banned, and Jamaat ud Dawa, which is not. In reality, they remain two sides of a single organization, led by the same individuals. The military and the intelligence service still support the group. It remains their most reliable terrorist ally against India, sends fighters to Afghanistan, and has helped to combat separatists in Baluchistan, which borders Iran and Afghanistan.\nBut militancy is not the group\xe2\x80\x99s only mission. It is also dedicated to proselytizing and nonviolent reformism intended to turn Pakistan into a \xe2\x80\x9cpure\xe2\x80\x9d Islamic state. Many Pakistanis see Jamaat-ud-Dawa, which runs hospitals and ambulance services across the country, as a robust social welfare organization, and not an alias for a lethal terrorist group.\nDebates about whether to take part in elections have been continuing for years, according to Laskhar-e-Taiba officials I have spoken with. Yet starting a political party was a major step for an organization whose longstanding position was that Islam forbids participation in electoral politics.\nThe attempt to begin a party occurred at a time when the group and the Pakistani government are under increasing international pressure. Pakistan might make a cosmetic distinction between Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jamaat-ud-Dawa, but the United States and the United Nations have designated both as terrorist groups. The Financial Action Task Force, an international body focused on combating terrorist financing, has also zeroed in on Jamaat ud Dawa and its leader Hafiz Muhammad Saeed.\nTo placate the United States, the Pakistani government \n in January and put his organization on a watch list for groups that may be involved in terrorism.\nRecasting their organization as a political party could have provided Mr. Saeed and other leaders with more influence over how the state deals with their group. It also would have given them greater freedom to operate, especially when it comes to raising money.\nRather than sucking recruits and resources away from Lashkar-e-Taiba, a new political party could have drawn in more of both. In addition to political cover for its terrorist activities, this would have been another mechanism to influence the domestic discourse and promote hawkish policies toward India.\nIn theory, entering electoral politics can have a moderating influence on terrorist organizations and perhaps even create conditions for mainstreaming them.\nWasn\xe2\x80\x99t it preferable, the Pakistani official had asked me, for militants to involve themselves in elections than to continue engaging in terrorism? Of course, it was. Except Pakistan had never forced them to choose between terrorism and politics. Instead, these men and the groups they led have been allowed to ply their terrorist trade while simultaneously increasing their political power.\nIt would be na\xc3\xafve to think that the election commission\xe2\x80\x99s decision is a harbinger of a shift in terms of Pakistan\xe2\x80\x99s policy of supporting and tolerating militant groups. The men who lead them continue contesting elections as independent candidates and may persist in their attempts to register their proscribed organizations under different names. But for the moment, the election commission has held the line against allowing terrorist organizations to contest elections in Pakistan.\n'

aS'Past the Ferris wheel, a line of young immigrants snaked into the crowded hallways of an event space on Chicago\xe2\x80\x99s Navy Pier. It was August 2012. I overheard two women wondering whether they should have showed up and gotten in the line, to apply for a new program that would let some undocumented people who had come to this country as children get a work permit.\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know if we should trust the government,\xe2\x80\x9d one of the women said.\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know, either,\xe2\x80\x9d the other replied. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I really want to work and help my mom pay rent.\xe2\x80\x9d\nIt wasn\xe2\x80\x99t your choice to come to America. But once you realize you\xe2\x80\x99re here illegally, it becomes your choice to figure out who gets to know that.\nCan you tell your classmates that you can\xe2\x80\x99t join the overseas choir trip because you don\xe2\x80\x99t have a valid passport? Can you tell your coach that you have to stay in the area and can\xe2\x80\x99t be recruited by an out-of-state college? Can you tell a human resources manager that you can\xe2\x80\x99t get a driver\xe2\x80\x99s license because you don\xe2\x80\x99t have a Social Security number?\nWhen you exist in a legal maze shrouded in doubts, every decision is a gut check.\nIn 2002, Pat Foote, a recruiter at The Seattle Times, told me that she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t offer me a summer internship because I am in the United States illegally. I later made my way to Seattle just so that I could look her in the eye and ask that she not share my secret. She was a stranger, the first potential employer I\xe2\x80\x99d ever told, and I asked for her trust.\nThe scariest stranger of all is the United States government. It could deport you from the place you call home. That\xe2\x80\x99s a fear I live with.\nThe landscape of trust shifted dramatically in 2012, when President Barack Obama issued a directive to establish the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. In addition to protecting immigrants who were brought to the United States before the age of 16 from deportation for a renewable two-year period, it granted a work permit to qualified immigrants who were under age 31 on June 15, 2012, the date of its announcement. Applicants paid a $465 fee for processing and gave all their contact information (name, address, phone number) to the government they had grown up fearing. In effect, the Obama administration said, \xe2\x80\x9cTrust us.\xe2\x80\x9d\nI did not qualify for DACA \xe2\x80\x94 I turned 31 four months before the policy was announced \xe2\x80\x94 but was thrilled for my younger undocumented friends who did qualify. I carried that thrill with me to Chicago on the first day that people could apply. Since then, an estimated 800,000 undocumented Americans across the country have received this deferred action.\nAs soon as news started leaking that President Trump, who campaigned on ending the program, would deliver on his promise, the questions came flooding in. Friends whose lives and livelihoods depended on this promise the government had made needed to know: Will my boss still keep me on when DACA expires? Will my scholarship continue? How can I pay my mortgage? Who can we trust now?\nCan we trust President Trump, whose conflicting messages illustrate his ignorance of how DACA works?\nContradicting what the attorney general and the president have said in public, a \n on DACA is making the rounds among my friends and colleagues, in group text messages and private Facebook groups. \xe2\x80\x9cThe Department of Homeland Security urges DACA recipients to use the time remaining on their work authorizations to prepare for and arrange their departure from the United States \xe2\x80\x94 including proactively seeking travel documentation \xe2\x80\x94 or to apply for other immigration benefits for which they may be eligible,\xe2\x80\x9d the memo says. After reading it, a friend who\xe2\x80\x99s a DACA recipient texted our group: \xe2\x80\x9cThis is not a time for us to get fooled. This memo is telling us pack our bags.\xe2\x80\x9d\nCan we trust Congress, especially given that some Democrats and Republicans have historically used so-called Dreamers, named after the long-stalled Dream Act, as bargaining chips?\nWe can\xe2\x80\x99t know what President Trump and Congress will do. But we do know who to trust now \xe2\x80\x94 the people we had to trust before. To me, that means the teachers who see up close the injustice of life as an undocumented immigrant in this country.\nThe first adult I ever told I was here illegally was Mrs. Denny, my high school choir teacher. It\xe2\x80\x99s a story I\xe2\x80\x99ve told many times, and \n about too, because the moment meant so much to me.\nAfter she announced to our class that we were going to Japan for spring break, I pulled her aside and said that I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t go. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t have the right passport,\xe2\x80\x9d I said. Confused, Mrs. Denny replied: \xe2\x80\x9cOh, it\xe2\x80\x99s O.K., Jose. We\xe2\x80\x99ll get you the right passport.\xe2\x80\x9d I told her it was more complicated than that, that I didn\xe2\x80\x99t have any piece of legal document that I could show, that I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t supposed to be here. Her eyes widened, her lips pursed, and she didn\xe2\x80\x99t say another thing. A couple of days later, to my surprise, she told the class that we were going to Hawaii instead. Years later, she told me: \xe2\x80\x9cYou were my kid. I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t going to leave any of my kids behind.\xe2\x80\x9d\nHow many more Mrs. Dennys have made and will continue to make that decision?\n'

aS'In the first year of his presidency, Donald Trump has achieved at least three things that few presidents ever have. His approval rating is in the 30s. His former aides \xe2\x80\x94 and reportedly the president himself \xe2\x80\x94 are under federal investigation. And members of Mr. Trump\xe2\x80\x99s own party are running what has been \n to replace him in 2020.\nBut when I hear people talk of Mr. Trump\xe2\x80\x99s supposedly dismal future, I think of his not-so-dismal past. I was the first national television correspondent to cover Mr. Trump full-time, so I know what can happen when people ignore the unbridled enthusiasm of his crowds.\nFor more than 500 days, I watched as Mr. Trump\xe2\x80\x99s campaign grew from an awkward rally around a backyard pool in June 2015 to a raucous, 10,000-person convention center event in November 2016. In that same time, I also watched as Mr. Trump\xe2\x80\x99s candidacy survived a procession of death predictions.\nLately, it seems, those predictions are back. Last month, when asked whether the president will be the Republican nominee in 2020, the Republican senator from Maine, Susan Collins, told MSNBC, \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s too difficult to say.\xe2\x80\x9d\nEvery week there\xe2\x80\x99s a new last straw: Comey, Charlottesville, Arpaio. If all else fails, Robert Mueller, the special counsel, will surely take him down, right?\nWhen I was out on the road following Mr. Trump, I sneaked in a bit of \xe2\x80\x9cGame of Thrones\xe2\x80\x9d on my laptop between rallies. What I learned, to paraphrase the show, is that what is dead may never die \xe2\x80\x94 and, in Mr. Trump\xe2\x80\x99s case, may only rise stronger.\nMr. Trump\xe2\x80\x99s candidacy was dead when he announced it. (Mexico is sending \xe2\x80\x9crapists.\xe2\x80\x9d) His candidacy was dead when he insulted a former prisoner of war named John McCain. (\xe2\x80\x9cI like people who weren\xe2\x80\x99t captured.\xe2\x80\x9d) His candidacy was dead when he cast suspicion on an entire religion. (\xe2\x80\x9cDonald J. Trump is calling for a complete and total shutdown of Muslims entering the United States.\xe2\x80\x9d)\nDead when he attacked a federal judge, a Gold Star family, the pope. Deader than dead when he bragged about grabbing women by their genitals. (\xe2\x80\x9cWhen you\xe2\x80\x99re a star, they let you do it.\xe2\x80\x9d)\nThe more Mr. Trump\xe2\x80\x99s candidacy was said to flatline, the more life I saw in his crowds.\nIn August 2015, a month after a high-ranking Republican National Committee operative promised me that America would never tolerate a man with no military service disparaging an American military hero, I was standing on a football field in Mobile, Ala., surrounded by 30,000 screaming Trump fans, an unheard-of turnout six months before a primary. Were they mad about the candidates words on Mr. McCain? No. The opposite. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s not afraid of anybody,\xe2\x80\x9d one woman told me.\nOf all the times Donald Trump was done, it is his current status as a supposedly lame duck first-term president that reminds me most of his final months on the trail. Back then, luminaries in his own party were condemning him, calling on him to drop out and researching a late-race change to the top of the ticket.\nMuch of the country was outraged. The polls were bleak. No politician had ever come back from what Mr. Trump was facing. But then, as now, the view from armchairs in Washington and newsrooms around the country missed something that it was impossible to miss out on the trail. Mr. Trump\xe2\x80\x99s supporters were tired \xe2\x80\x94 of Washington, of the media, of waiting. And that fatigue allowed them to overlook a lot. They knew he was flawed but at least, they thought, he was on their side.\nOn one of Mr. Trump\xe2\x80\x99s primary victory nights, in a ballroom at Mar-a-Lago, surrounded by people in diamonds and silk, I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t help wondering what Mr. Trump\xe2\x80\x99s rally crowds would think of all the money their candidate chose to celebrate with. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy do people fighting for a raise relate to all of this?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked a man in a tuxedo. \xe2\x80\x9cBecause deep down, they know he\xe2\x80\x99s one of them,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\n\xe2\x80\x9cTrump sees us,\xe2\x80\x9d his supporters would tell me, everywhere we stopped. \xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\nWhen they couldn\xe2\x80\x99t exactly cheer for him, they found ways to excuse him. Five days after the \xe2\x80\x9cAccess Hollywood\xe2\x80\x9d tape, for example, I asked an older woman in a flowery red dress what she thought of her candidate\xe2\x80\x99s theory of sexual license \xe2\x80\x94 as a lone protester was playing the tape on a loop outside a rally venue in Lakeland, Fla.\nShe smiled. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat person hasn\xe2\x80\x99t said it?\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\n\xe2\x80\x9cI haven\xe2\x80\x99t said it,\xe2\x80\x9d I said.\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, good for you,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve said you\xe2\x80\x99re going to grab women by the \xe2\x80\xa6 ?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked.\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. Don\xe2\x80\x99t be stupid,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, and walked away.\nShortly after, Mr. Trump was onstage, kissing a pink Women for Trump sign, really pressing his face against it. The crowd roared because they thought it was funny and because it was a clear rebuke to anyone offended by what Mr. Trump waved away as \xe2\x80\x9clocker room talk.\xe2\x80\x9d\nSometimes Mr. Trump\xe2\x80\x99s supporters had to justify or ignore his positions, too. Sure, they liked a lot of his policies and ideas, but they weren\xe2\x80\x99t married to any of them. They wanted the man above all. And if he said it, they\xe2\x80\x99d find a way to support it, even if he reversed himself the next day.\nI once asked a man heading into a rally why he supported Donald Trump.\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause he is going to build a wall,\xe2\x80\x9d the man said.\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat if he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t?\xe2\x80\x9d I countered.\n\xe2\x80\x9cI trust his judgment,\xe2\x80\x9d the man said.\nThey trusted his judgment and on Election Day they trusted Mr. Trump more than they trusted any of us. That\xe2\x80\x99s why when members of the media pronounced his candidacy dead, his supporters knew the opposite was true. It was never more alive.\nMaybe that has changed. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. Nobody does. The building blocks of political life are too complex to predict, too unstable to rely on. But I do know what political devotion looks like, and I do know what happens when you choose to discount it.\n'

aS'NAIROBI, Kenya \xe2\x80\x94 Peace means so much more after you\xe2\x80\x99ve experienced violence. Less than a month ago, my country, Kenya, \n. On the morning the polls opened, my heart raced \xe2\x80\x94 I come from and work in the Kibera slums, and it is often said, \xe2\x80\x9cWhen Kibera burns, so does Kenya.\xe2\x80\x9d But not this time.\nDuring my childhood, campaign season was the only time we ate rice. My mother would come home with a small portion of rice, a handout from a politician. \xe2\x80\x9cWhere did the rice come from?\xe2\x80\x9d I would ask her, and she would say from someone campaigning, the name unimportant, her vote equally unassured. As she served the rice to my siblings and our neighbors, she would repeat an old refrain: \xe2\x80\x9cEmpty containers make a lot of noise.\xe2\x80\x9d\nMy mother understood who the real winners and losers are in Kenyan politics. Her allegiance was never to the politicians but to the people, from many tribes, with whom we lived. In Kibera, neighbors are often the only safety nets. They offer a cup of maize meal on hungry nights. They watch over children as they walk to school. Without my neighbors \xe2\x80\x94 Luos, Kikuyus, Nubians \xe2\x80\x94 I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be where I am today. And I am not alone.\nYet barely 10 years ago, we forgot this simple truth: Our communities are more fundamental to our survival than the oft-broken promises of politicians. The violence surrounding our 2007 elections left more than 1,000 dead and hundreds of thousands displaced. Politicians driven by self-interest turned tribes against one another \xe2\x80\x94 neighbor against neighbor.\nOn the night of the election, Kibera, normally filled with the sounds of life, was filled with the noise of gunfire. I cowered under my bed, the walls of my shack made from discarded milk cartons the only barrier between the bullets outside and me. Neighbors from different tribes who had lived together for years turned against one another in an instant. One night, I planned to stay with friends in another part of Kibera. By chance, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t make it to their house. All four of my friends were killed that night, murdered in the cold blood of tribal hatred. The next day, I fled for my safety.\nAs I left Kenya, I passed checkpoints where vigilantes asked at random to see ID cards, to establish ethnic identity. I saw a man being beheaded for being from the \xe2\x80\x9cwrong\xe2\x80\x9d tribe. I resolved that never again would we be misled to believe that there are more than two tribes in Kenya: the rich and the poor. And though I ended up attending college in the United States, I returned to Kenya, to Kibera, to help my neighbors so that they will never again turn on one another. Today I am building a movement for community-led change to transform urban slums through services like health care and education.\nWe\xe2\x80\x99ve made progress since 2007, but the names of those we lost are still fresh in our minds. I asked a friend whom I had known since childhood what might happen after this year\xe2\x80\x99s elections. He told me, \xe2\x80\x9cIt will be peaceful, unless we lose.\xe2\x80\x9d I asked, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat then?\xe2\x80\x9d He replied simply, \xe2\x80\x9cWe are ready for war.\xe2\x80\x9d\nThis desperation comes with a life in extreme poverty. This desperation is the barrier to lasting peace. In Kenya, there are millions of angry young people. Elections give them a cause. Politicians exploit this vulnerability.\nI realized that if a call to violence could provide people an opportunity to contribute, so could a call to peace. So months ago I met with a childhood friend, Milar, one of Kibera\xe2\x80\x99s most influential residents. Over beers, I asked him if he might consider becoming a peace ambassador, bridging divides in the run-up to the election. He said yes, and over many weeks we met with hundreds of leaders across Kibera to preach an allegiance to our community instead of to the will of the political class.\nOn the night the results of the election were announced, policemen in Kibera opened fire on angry opposition protesters. Milar stepped in between the protesters and the police \xe2\x80\x94 his boldness shocked both sides. Milar told the police commander that if the officers would retreat, he would in turn persuade the protesters to go home. After a tense moment, the police agreed, and both sides pulled back.\nA few days later, Milar saw a young woman wearing a T-shirt from the Jubilee party, a coalition led by President Uhuru Kenyatta, being beaten by a group of young men in Kibera, an opposition stronghold. Milar, though himself an opponent of Jubilee, jumped into the fray and saved her life.\nDespite the provocations of the police and the calls for violence, peace has held on in Kibera. Last month my friend Leymah Gbowee, a Nobel Peace Prize laureate from Liberia, and Abigail Disney, an American filmmaker, joined me at several town hall meetings that I had organized before the Supreme Court was set to rule on the validity of the election. Although Mr. Kenyatta\xe2\x80\x99s party declared victory, a petition from the opposition leader Raila Odinga claimed that there were voting irregularities and that the election should be annulled. There was a real chance of violence however the court ruled.\nLeymah asked, \xe2\x80\x9cIf you burn down your community, where will your child go to the hospital?\xe2\x80\x9d The audience answered, \xe2\x80\x9cNowhere.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere will the children of your politicians go?\xe2\x80\x9d\nThey replied, \xe2\x80\x9cLondon, South Africa, India.\xe2\x80\x9d\nAfterward, Milar came to me, his face streaked with tears. \xe2\x80\x9cWe have to stop fighting the rich man\xe2\x80\x99s wars,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. In that room, surrounded by women and men, many of whom have fought on the streets before, a realization dawned: We must fight poverty, not one another.\nOn Sept. 1, the Supreme Court ruled in favor of the opposition\xe2\x80\x99s petition and annulled the election. And the peace held.\nIt will be only through the experience of hope and community-led progress that this peace might last. Together, we can build something that our politicians promise but cannot deliver: lasting hope. But we cannot wait; we must follow my mother\xe2\x80\x99s example and share our rice.\n'

aS'As Gen. H. R. McMaster, the national security adviser, wrote in his book \xe2\x80\x9cDereliction of Duty,\xe2\x80\x9d the early stages of the Vietnam War caught America\xe2\x80\x99s military leaders flat-footed. Having gone through World War II and Korea, they were all ready for a conventional war. But insurgencies and unconventional warfare were something else. As a result, they were inordinately acquiescent to the wishful thinking of their civilian overseers \xe2\x80\x94 and no one thought more wishfully about the war than Walt Whitman Rostow.\nA Yale Ph.D. and a Rhodes scholar, Rostow left his academic perch at M.I.T. to join the State Department under John F. Kennedy; he was later Lyndon Johnson\xe2\x80\x99s national security adviser during the center-cut of American involvement in Vietnam, from April 1966 to January 1969. More than anyone else, he epitomized the overweening confidence of the civilian strategists of the era \xe2\x80\x94 he was the best and the brightest of \xe2\x80\x9cthe best and the brightest.\xe2\x80\x9d He could lay distant claim to operational warfighting competence, having selected bombing targets as a major in the Office of Strategic Services during World War II. But like many other prominent civilian strategists of the day, he was by training and disposition an economist and a technocrat.\nIn his 1960 book \xe2\x80\x9cThe Stages of Economic Growth: A Non-Communist Manifesto,\xe2\x80\x9d Rostow posited that robust growth was a nation\xe2\x80\x99s best insurance against the political emergence of Communism, and cast growth as a multistage process that depended crucially on a \xe2\x80\x9ctakeoff\xe2\x80\x9d period propelled by rapid expansion in key segments of an economy. Though criticized as tendentiously Western-centric, the book attracted Kennedy\xe2\x80\x99s attention. In a matter of months, Rostow moved from holding forth in the academy to planning America\xe2\x80\x99s strategy in Vietnam, tightly guided by his ideas about economic development.\nMost leading civilian strategists, who were so inventive and authoritative on nuclear strategy, steered a safe middle course between withdrawal and escalation in Vietnam, and did not enunciate big strategic concepts to guide the prosecution of the war. Rostow was different. He believed that the Vietcong were impeding South Vietnam\xe2\x80\x99s advancement to the takeoff stage, and that the United States therefore needed to expend all necessary military and diplomatic means to stop the Vietcong\xe2\x80\x99s guerrilla infiltration. This was a neatly packaged but narrow vision that both opened the door to expansive military action but also reduced it to an adjunct of politics and economics.\nAlong those lines, Rostow reflexively argued for a \xe2\x80\x9cflexible response\xe2\x80\x9d when it came to military escalation, from ratcheting up the role of military \xe2\x80\x9cadvisers\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 that is, embedded Special Forces \xe2\x80\x94 in the early 1960s, to bombing North Vietnam starting in 1965, to steadily increasing the United States\xe2\x80\x99 expeditionary combat presence in the mid- and late 1960s. Directly defeating the enemy was never the goal; military action was just a way to apply pressure, to maximize psychological intimidation \xe2\x80\x94 what came to be known as the \xe2\x80\x9cRostow thesis.\xe2\x80\x9d\nBut crucially, Rostow didn\xe2\x80\x99t actually know much about fighting a war. Any soldier could have told him that increased bombing or troop levels were not the same as, say, increasing food aid. Nor could one rely on data in the same way when it came to war. Rostow was one of the most avid followers of the weekly body counts, equating the number of enemy reported killed with military progress, as if he were reading the latest reports on grain production.\nIn November 1967, an increasingly wary Robert McNamara, the secretary of defense, raised the idea of reassessing the war effort, shifting greater combat responsibility to the South Vietnamese \xe2\x80\x94 the policy that would become known as \xe2\x80\x9cVietnamization\xe2\x80\x9d under President Richard Nixon \xe2\x80\x94 and a bombing halt. Rostow agreed to the first two measures, but opposed the third, and President Johnson sided with him.\nDespite McNamara\xe2\x80\x99s crisis of confidence \xe2\x80\x94 he departed the Pentagon in February 1968 \xe2\x80\x94 Rostow continued to comb through intelligence reports looking for reassuring factoids. During the Tet offensive he denied even the possibility that the surprise attacks had provided a psychological shot in the arm to the Vietcong, concentrating instead on the huge casualties American and South Vietnamese forces had inflicted on them. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is a great victory for our side,\xe2\x80\x9d he told a colleague while they sat in the White House Situation Room. The ensuing 24-day battle for Hue, an agonizing engagement that American forces would also tactically win, drove home the strength of the enemy\xe2\x80\x99s determination and staying power. But Rostow never saw the battle that way.\nTo the end, Rostow remained not just a supporter of the president, but a crutch. As David Halberstam wrote of Rostow in \xe2\x80\x9cThe Best and the Brightest\xe2\x80\x9d:\nThe upshot was that Rostow\xe2\x80\x99s status as designated administration hawk in chief induced in him a preoccupation with bureaucratic politics and buoying morale that impaired his strategic objectivity as American frustrations in Vietnam mounted. He, more than any of Johnson\xe2\x80\x99s other advisers, was consumed with showing the press and the American public \xe2\x80\x9clight at the end of the tunnel.\xe2\x80\x9d\nThe historian David Milne has called Rostow \xe2\x80\x9cAmerica\xe2\x80\x99s Rasputin.\xe2\x80\x9d He was not alone as an early advocate for flexible response and a deepening commitment in Vietnam. But long after McNamara and others turned against the war, even as evidence mounted against the Rostow thesis, he remained steadfast.\nAnd while in the ensuing decades most of the advisers, including McNamara, admitted that they were wrong, Rostow, \n, pointedly refused to apologize for the war or second-guess himself.\nHe remained a Cold Warrior until the end. In 1986 he superficially attributed the fall of Saigon to Congressional budget cuts. And he continued to insist that the war was worthwhile. Joining a wave of historical revisionists, he argued that the war had bought time for other Southeast Asian nations to consolidate Western-leaning governments and subdue Communist influences \xe2\x80\x94 in other words, that the domino theory was right. Like many of Kennedy\xe2\x80\x99s brain trust, Rostow was initially praised for his pragmatic, technocratic liberalism \xe2\x80\x94 but in his determination to impose his sterile ideas on the complicated realities of Southeast Asia, he proved to be as ideologically committed as the Communists he so adamantly opposed.\n'

aS'OAKLAND, Calif. \xe2\x80\x94 This was the summer that the forests turned red. From the fir and hemlock stands of Puget Sound to the oak and pine groves of California, the light in the woods has gone all kinds of wrong. The greens have been replaced by oranges, the normal hues vaporized in the smoke that has choked so much of the West in this season of wildfire.\nThe West, of course, is no stranger to fire. Natives and newcomers alike grow accustomed to our annual apocalypse of flame. While this fire season is no doubt bad \xe2\x80\x94 more than 80 big burns now burning from Montana to Southern California, while the August conflagrations that swept British Columbia were the province\xe2\x80\x99s \n \xe2\x80\x94 we\xe2\x80\x99re still unlikely to surpass the record fires of 2015, when more than 10 million acres burned.\nWhat has made this fire season so terrifying isn\xe2\x80\x99t the size or intensity of the fires, awful as they were, but the enormous clouds of smoke that have come with them. In many places, for days on end the sky has been enveloped in haze, the sun reduced to a hot, distant penny.\nThe smoke screens that have hit Seattle, San Francisco, Denver, Portland, Ore., and most of Montana are a product of the same enormous high-pressure system that incited a historic heat wave earlier in the summer. The heat contributes to the fires, then the smoke gets trapped. The West Coast\xe2\x80\x99s natural air-conditioning of Pacific Ocean wind hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been able to blow the smoke away. And now there\xe2\x80\x99s ash coating Portland.\nThe smoke makes the very air we breathe toxic. At one point last month, the air quality in the Seattle region was likened to that of Beijing at its worst, a threat to the old and the young, and those with respiratory problems. Also terrifying is how the smoke has twisted the light. With the ordinary palette of the world turned upside down, the familiar has become disorienting. Usual comforts seem unsettling and uncanny.\nNormally I go to the woods for retreat, for contemplation and invigoration. But the forest has become alien with all of the smoke. In the Pacific Northwest during the zenith of the British Columbia fires, it was as if a cinematographer had put a red lens on the camera. The evergreens went matte, while the rust-colored trunks of madrone trees were poppingly visible from hundreds of yards away. The cedar trunks were nearly pulsating with color.\nIn Northern California during the Labor Day heat wave, the woods were changed, too. The patches of sun on a trail at midmorning had the pastel cast of evening. The natural detritus of the California woods \xe2\x80\x94 old bay and willow leaves, spent bracken and downed logs \xe2\x80\x94 looked ominous in the orange light.\nFriends in Montana report that the haze and the smoke remind them of the recent solar eclipse. Shadows go fuzzy, similar to how it was when the sun was at 25 percent of normal.\nEveryone seems to agree that the sunsets have been epic, but that the moons are spooky: heavy peach globes, weirdly portentous. One summer night in Washington, I saw a waxing crescent moon stained a red darker than blood.\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s hard not to think that these alterations are just a glimpse of things to come. Perhaps this is the new normal of climate change. With all the dust and smoke in the air, the world will begin to look different. The sky will be milkier, less often intensely blue. Every sunset will be hot pink and hallucinogenic. The green trees of the forest will be cast under a rose lamp.\nThe transformation of familiar sites is bound to take a psychic toll. In 1893, the Norwegian artist Edvard Munch completed his most famous painting, \xe2\x80\x9cThe Scream,\xe2\x80\x9d with its haunting vibe of existential dread. The nightmare image, with its swirls of deep reds and blues, was inspired by Munch\xe2\x80\x99s experience, a decade earlier, of witnessing an unearthly sunset, created in part by airborne particulates emitted by the eruption of the Indonesian volcano Krakatau, on the other side of the planet. All of the ash from the volcano scattered the blue-violet wavelengths of light, just as the smoke blanketing the West is doing now. At the sight of ruptured sky, Munch said he felt \xe2\x80\x9ca great, unending scream piercing through nature.\xe2\x80\x9d\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s a pretty good description of what these smoke storms have felt like. Maybe the strange, never-before-seen landscapes of our hot, hazy century will make for some incredible art. But like Munch, I also worry that it will bring us something much darker, more forlorn. Not for nothing did he title one study for his painting \xe2\x80\x9cDespair.\xe2\x80\x9d\n'

aS'CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va. \xe2\x80\x94 On Wednesday, Facebook revealed that hundreds of Russia-based accounts had run anti-Hillary Clinton ads precisely aimed at Facebook users whose demographic profiles implied a vulnerability to political propaganda. It will take time to prove whether the account owners had any relationship with the Russian government, but one thing is clear: Facebook has contributed to, and profited from, the erosion of democratic norms in the United States and elsewhere.\nThe audacity of a hostile foreign power trying to influence American voters rightly troubles us. But it should trouble us more that Facebook makes such manipulation so easy, and renders political ads exempt from the basic accountability and transparency that healthy democracy demands.\nThe majority of the Facebook ads did not directly mention a presidential candidate, according to Alex Stamos, head of security at Facebook, but \xe2\x80\x9cappeared to focus on amplifying divisive social and political messages across the ideological spectrum \xe2\x80\x94 touching on topics from L.G.B.T. matters to race issues to immigration to gun rights.\xe2\x80\x9d\nThe ads \xe2\x80\x94 about 3,000 placed by 470 accounts and pages spending about $100,000 \xe2\x80\x94 were what the advertising industry calls \xe2\x80\x9cdark posts,\xe2\x80\x9d seen only by a very specific audience, obscured by the flow of posts within a Facebook News Feed and ephemeral. Facebook calls its \xe2\x80\x9cdark post\xe2\x80\x9d service \xe2\x80\x9cunpublished page post ads.\xe2\x80\x9d\nThis should not surprise us. Anyone can deploy Facebook ads. They are affordable and easy. That\xe2\x80\x99s one reason that Facebook has grown so quickly, taking in $27.6 billion in revenue in 2016, virtually all of it from advertisers, by serving up the attention of two billion Facebook users across the globe.\nThe service is popular among advertisers for its efficiency, effectiveness and responsiveness. Facebook gives rich and instant feedback to advertisers, allowing them to quickly tailor ads to improve outcomes or customize messages even more. There is nothing mysterious or untoward about the system itself, as long as it\xe2\x80\x99s being used for commerce instead of politics. What\xe2\x80\x99s alarming is that Facebook executives don\xe2\x80\x99t seem to grasp, or appreciate, the difference.\nA core principle in political advertising is transparency \xe2\x80\x94 political ads are supposed to be easily visible to everyone, and everyone is supposed to understand that they are political ads, and where they come from. And it\xe2\x80\x99s expensive to run even one version of an ad in traditional outlets, let alone a dozen different versions. Moreover, in the case of federal campaigns in the United States, the 2002 McCain-Feingold campaign-finance act requires candidates to state they approve of an ad and thus take responsibility for its content.\nNone of that transparency matters to Facebook. Ads on the site meant for, say, 20- to 30-year-old home-owning Latino men in Northern Virginia would not be viewed by anyone else, and would run only briefly before vanishing. The potential for abuse is vast. An ad could falsely accuse a candidate of the worst malfeasance a day before Election Day, and the victim would have no way of even knowing it happened. Ads could stoke ethnic hatred and no one could prepare or respond before serious harm occurs.\nUnfortunately, the range of potential responses to this problem is limited. The First Amendment grants broad protections to publishers like Facebook. Diplomacy, even the harsh kind, has failed to dissuade Russia from meddling. And it\xe2\x80\x99s even less likely to under the current administration.\nDaniel Kreiss, a communication scholar at the University of North Carolina, proposes that sites such as Facebook, Twitter and YouTube maintain a repository of campaign ads so that regulators, scholars, journalists and the public can examine and expose them. But the companies have no impetus to concur and coordinate. And Congress is unlikely to reform a system that campaigns are just learning to master.\nFacebook has no incentive to change its ways. The money is too great. The issue is too nebulous to alienate more than a few Facebook users. The more that Facebook saturates our lives, families and communities, the harder it is to live without it.\nFacebook has pledged to install better filtering systems using artificial intelligence and machine-learning to flag accounts that are run by automated \xe2\x80\x9cbots\xe2\x80\x9d or violate the site\xe2\x80\x99s terms of service. But these are just new versions of the technologies that have caused the problem in the first place. And there would be no accountability beyond Facebook\xe2\x80\x99s word. The fact remains that in the arms race to keep propaganda flowing, human beings review troublesome accounts only long after the damage has been done.\nOur best hopes sit in Brussels and London. European regulators have been watching Facebook and Google for years. They have taken strong actions against both companies for violating European consumer data protection standards and business competition laws. The British government is investigating the role Facebook and its use of citizens\xe2\x80\x99 data played in the 2016 Brexit referendum and 2017 national elections.\nWe are in the midst of a worldwide, internet-based assault on democracy. Scholars at the Oxford Internet Institute have tracked armies of volunteers and bots as they move propaganda across Facebook and Twitter in efforts to undermine trust in democracy or to elect their preferred candidates in the Philippines, India, France, the Netherlands, Britain and elsewhere.

aS' Hurricane Maria smashed into Dominica with 160 mph winds, ripping the roof off even the prime minister\'s residence and causing what he called "mind-boggling" devastation Tuesday as it plunged into a Caribbean region already ravaged by Hurricane Irma.\nThe storm was on a track to wallop Puerto Rico on Wednesday "with a force and violence that we haven\'t seen for several generations," the territory\'s governor said.\nDominica Prime Minister Roosevelt Skerrit said on his Facebook page that "initial reports are of widespread devastation" and said he feared there would be deaths due to rain-fed landslides.\n"So far the winds have swept away the roofs of almost every person I have spoken to or otherwise made contact with," Skerrit wrote. "The roof to my own official residence was among the first to go."\nAnd he appealed for international aid:\n"We will need help, my friend, we will need help of all kinds."\nMaria\'s eye roared over the island late Monday night. The storm briefly dipped to Category 4 strength early Tuesday before regaining Category 5 status.\nFierce winds and rain lashed mountainous Dominica for hours. A police official on the island, Inspector Pellam Jno Baptiste, said late Monday night that there were no immediate reports of casualties but it was too dangerous for officers to check conditions.\n"Where we are, we can\'t move," he said in a brief phone interview while hunkered down against the region\'s second Category 5 hurricane this month.\n"The winds are merciless! We shall survive by the grace of God," Skerrit wrote at the start of a series of increasingly harrowing posts on Facebook.\nA few minutes later, he messaged he could hear the sound of galvanized steel roofs tearing off houses on the small rugged island.\nHe then wrote that he thought his home had been damaged, and added: "Rough! Rough! Rough!"\nOn the nearby island of Martinique, officials said about 25,000 households were without electricity and two small towns without water after Maria roared past.\nThe head of French civil security, Jacques Witkowski, told reporters that it was too soon to say whether the French department of Guadaloupe had fared as well.\nPrefect Eric Maire, the highest French official of Guadaloupe, said in a video on Twitter that some roads and homes were flooded and heavy rain expected to continue. He told the population to "remain inside."\nAuthorities in the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico, which faced the possibility of a direct hit, warned that people in wooden or flimsy homes should find safe shelter before the storm\'s expected arrival there on Wednesday.\n"You have to evacuate. Otherwise, you\'re going to die," said Hector Pesquera, the island\'s public safety commissioner. "I don\'t know how to make this any clearer."\nMaria had maximum sustained winds of 160 mph (260 kph) late Monday when it slammed into Dominica.\nThe U.S. National Hurricane Center said Maria weakened briefly before recovering sustained winds of 160 mph (260 kph) strength shortly before daybreak Tuesday. Its eye was located about 170 miles (275 kilometers) southeast of St. Croix, and the storm was moving west-northwest over the Caribbean at 9 mph (15 kph).\nForecasters warned Maria could even intensify over the next 24 hours or longer, noting its eye had shrunk to a compact 10 miles across and warning: "Maria is developing the dreaded pinhole eye."\nThat generally means an extremely strong hurricane will get even mightier, said Brian McNoldy, a hurricane researcher at the University of Miami. He said it just like when a spinning ice skater brings in their arms and rotates faster.\n"You just don\'t see those in weaker hurricanes," he said.\nThe storm\'s hurricane-force winds extended out about 35 miles (45 kilometers) and tropical storm-force winds out as far as 125 miles (205 kilometers).\nHurricane warnings were posted for the U.S. and British Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, Guadeloupe, Dominica, St. Kitts, Nevis and Montserrat. A tropical storm warning was issued for Martinique, Antigua and Barbuda, Saba, St. Eustatius, St. Maarten and Anguilla.\nForecasters said storm surge could raise water levels by 6 to 9 feet (1.8 to 2.7 meters) near the storm\'s center. The storm was predicted to bring 10 to 15 inches (25 to 38 centimeters) of rain across the islands, with more in isolated areas.\nClose to its path is the island of St. Croix in the U.S. Virgin Islands, where territorial Gov. Kenneth Mapp said Tuesday would be "a very, very long night."\nSt. Thomas and St. John are still stunned from a direct hit by Hurricane Irma, which did extensive damage and caused four deaths on the two islands.\nBarry University said it chartered a private plane to carry students and staff from its St. Croix facility to Florida in preparation for Maria. It said 72 people connected to the Barry\'s Physician Assistant Program and a few pets were on Monday\'s evacuation flight.\nIn neighboring Puerto Rico, nearly 70,000 people were still without power following their earlier brush with Irma and nearly 200 remained in shelters as Maria approached.\nGov. Ricardo Rossello said Puerto Rico had 500 shelters capable of taking in up to 133,000 people in a worst-case scenario. He also said the Federal Emergency Management Agency was ready to bring drinking water and help restore power immediately after the storm, which could hit as a Category 5 hurricane.\n"This is going to impact all of Puerto Rico with a force and violence that we haven\'t seen for several generations," he said. "We\'re going to lose a lot of infrastructure in Puerto Rico. We\'re going to have to rebuild."\nRossello warned that an island-wide power outage could last a "long time" given the power company\'s deteriorated and weak infrastructure.\nTo the north, Hurricane Jose stirred up dangerous surf and rip currents along the U.S. East Coast, though forecasters said the storm was unlikely to make landfall. Big waves caused by Jose swept five people off a coastal jetty in Rhode Island and they were hospitalized after being rescued.\nA tropical storm warning was posted for coastal areas in Rhode Island and Massachusetts, and tropical storm watches were up for parts of New York\'s Long Island and Connecticut.\nJose\'s center was about 350 miles (560 kilometers) south-southwest of Nantucket, Massachusetts, early Tuesday and moving north at 9 mph (15 kph). The storm had maximum sustained winds of 75 mph (120 kph).\n'

aS' Elected on the nationalist slogan "America first," President Donald Trump will use his debut address to the U.N. General Assembly to argue that individual nations should act in their own self-interest, yet rally together when faced with a common threat such as North Korea.\nTrump, who has warned of "fire and fury" if North Korea does not back down, was expected to argue Tuesday that the dangers posed by Kim Jung Un\'s pursuit of a nuclear weapons program should unite all nations. And he planned to issue not just warnings to North Korea but also rebukes to states that have enabled Pyongyang, though it was unclear if he would criticize China by name.\nAddressing the General Assembly is a milestone moment for any president, but one particularly significant for Trump, a relative newcomer to foreign policy who has at times rattled the international community with his unpredictability. He has pulled the Unites States out of multinational agreements, considered shrinking the U.S. military footprint in the world and deployed bombastic language on North Korea that has been criticized by other world leaders.\nTrump frequently belittled the U.N. as a candidate and some within his White House believe the U.N acts as a global bureaucracy that infringes on the sovereignty of individual countries. But the president was expected to stand before world leaders and a global audience and declare that U.N. members, acting as a collection of self-interested nations, should unite to confront global dangers, according to aides previewing his speech.\nBeyond North Korea, crisis points the Republican president planned to address include Iran\'s nuclear agenda, the instability in Venezuela and the fight against terrorism in Syria and elsewhere.\nWorld leaders, many of whom will be seeing Trump in person for the first time, are bound to take the measure of the man and parse his every word for clues on how he views the U.S. role in the world and within the U.N.\n"It\'s a tremendous opportunity because the world wants to work with the United States if there\'s any way to do so," said Jon Alterman of the Center for Strategic and International Studies. "He has an opportunity to show surprising openness."\nTrump tipped his hand Monday as he riffed on his campaign slogan when asked to preview his central message to the General Assembly: "I think the main message is \'make the United Nations great\' \xe2\x80\x94 not \'again.\' \'Make the United Nations great.\'"\n"Such tremendous potential, and I think we\'ll be able to do this," he added.\nIn brief remarks to the U.N. on Monday, Trump chastised the world body\'s bloated bureaucracy and budget, saying, "We are not seeing the results in line with this investment."\nBut even with that scolding, Trump pledged to the U.N. that the United States would be "partners in your work" to make the organization a more effective force for world peace.\nHe praised the U.N.\'s early steps toward change and made no threats to withdraw U.S. support. The president\'s more measured tone stood in sharp contrast to the approach he took at NATO\'s new Brussels headquarters in May, when he upbraided member nations for not paying enough and refused to back its mutual defense pact explicitly.\nWhile running for office, Trump had labeled the U.N. weak and incompetent. He has suggested it was "not a friend" to the United States or democracy while deriding it as "a club for people to get together, talk and have a good time."\nHe thundered often about putting "America first," and has withdrawn from what he considered multilateral agreements that he found unfavorable to the United States, such as the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal. He also announced his intention to withdraw from the Paris climate accord, which would leave the U.S. one of only three countries outside the pact. Aides have since suggested Trump would be willing to renegotiate terms of the deal but European leaders have dismissed that approach.\nTrump has also frequently questioned the value of a robust American presence around the world. When briefed on the government\'s diplomatic, military and intelligence posts, the new president would often cast doubt on the need for all the resources.\nSome aides have suggested that Trump employs "principled realism" \xe2\x80\x94 making global decisions based on the best outcome for the United States. The administration has also shied away from talk of nation-building or creating democracies through the use of the U.S. military.\nBut Trump has softened his rhetoric about the United Nations since taking office and cheered the recent Security Council resolution that approved new sanctions against North Korea. Potentially foreshadowing a Trump argument, Brian Hook of the State Department said Monday that the U.N. could be useful as a "force multiplier" to "bring a global approach to global threats."\n"The president has been working very well with the U.N. Security Council," said Hook, who praised Trump\'s ability to deal with the world body and "leverage it for the purposes the U.N. charter created, to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war."\n'

aS' U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres warned the world\'s leaders Tuesday that the threat of a nuclear attack is at its highest level since the end of the Cold War and "fiery talk can lead to fatal misunderstandings."\nIn his first state-of-the-world report since taking the reins of the United Nations on Jan. 1, Guterres put "nuclear peril" as the leading threat warning that "we must not sleepwalk our way into war."\nThe U.N. chief told presidents, prime ministers and monarchs at the opening of the General Assembly\'s annual ministerial meeting that millions of people are living in fear "under a shadow of dread cast by the provocative nuclear and missile tests" of North Korea.\nHis message on "fiery" rhetoric was implicitly directed at North Korea\'s leader Kim Jong Un, but also at the United States and President Donald Trump, who has warned of "fire and fury" if North Korea does not back down.\nGuterres said a solution to the North Korea must be political and stressed to leaders: "This is a time for statesmanship."\nBeyond the nuclear threat, Guterres painted a grim picture of a troubled world facing grave challenges with many people "hurting and angry" because they "see insecurity rising, inequality growing, conflict spreading and climate changing."\n"Societies are fragmented," he said. "Political discourse is polarized. Trust within and among countries is being driven down by those who demonize and divide."\n"We are a world in pieces," Guterres said. "We need to be a world at peace."\nBut Guterres said there are seven threats and tests that stand in the way: nuclear peril, terrorism, unresolved conflicts and systematic violations of international humanitarian law, climate change, rising inequality, unintended consequences of innovation, and people on the move.\nThese issues are expected to dominate the six-day meeting. But on day one the spotlight is expected to be on Trump and French leader Emmanuel Macron who are also making their debuts at the General Assembly.\nMany world leaders, concerned about U.S. priorities and role in the world, will get their first chance to hear and meet Trump. He is scheduled to speak after Guterres and Brazil\'s president, who for more than 35 years has been the first leader to address the 193-member General Assembly.\nBrazilian President Michel Temer, charged last week with obstruction of justice and leading a criminal organization, flew to New York on Monday to continue the tradition, according to his office.\nAnother key speaker Tuesday is Qatari Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani. His country has been accused by a group of Arab nations, including Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, of supporting terrorist groups \xe2\x80\x94 an allegation Qatar denies.\nTurkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu are also scheduled to address the assembly.\nNot far behind North Korea on the list of issues needing urgent international attention is the plight of Myanmar\'s Rohingya Muslims, victims of what Guterres calls a campaign of "ethnic cleansing" that has driven nearly 400,000 to flee into Bangladesh in the past three weeks.\nFacing accusations of ethnic cleansing from Guterres and the U.N. human rights chief, Myanmar leader Aung San Suu Kyi earlier Tuesday defended the government and said her country does not fear international scrutiny. She invited diplomats to see some areas for themselves.\nGuterres told leaders in his General Assembly speech that "I take note" of Suu Kyi\'s speech.\n"We are all shocked by the dramatic escalation of sectarian tensions in Myanmar\'s Rakhine State," he said. "The authorities in Myanmar must end the military operations, and allow unhindered humanitarian access. They must also address the grievances of the Rohingya, whose status has been left unresolved for far too long."\nThe secretary-general has repeatedly focused on the major challenge posed by climate change.\nThe world leaders gathered as Hurricane Maria, a Category 5 storm, smashed the small Caribbean nation of Dominica with 160 mph winds. It ripped the roof off even the prime minister\'s residence and caused what he called "mind-boggling" devastation. The storm was on a track to strike Puerto Rico on Wednesday.\nOn Monday, Guterres and top government officials from several countries devastated by the other Category 5 storm, Hurricane Irma, addressed a hastily called U.N. meeting and appealed for help to rebuild following that storm\'s destruction.\nGuterres called this year\'s hurricane season "the most violent on record" and warned that extreme weather linked to climate change is having an impact all over the world, "including floods in southern Asia and landslides and droughts in Africa."\n'

aS' The hurricanes that battered Texas and Florida have likely spawned the worst disaster-created housing crisis since Hurricane Katrina left hundreds of thousands of Gulf Coast residents without homes more than a decade ago.\nThe Federal Emergency Management Agency said it\'s not borrowing from its much-maligned Katrina playbook to rely on government-issued trailers or mobile homes to shelter residents displaced by hurricanes Harvey and Irma.\n"We don\'t have enough FEMA trailers for all the homes that were destroyed," FEMA Administrator Brock Long said last week at a briefing in Washington. "If you combine Harvey and Irma, this is an extraordinary event that is going to require innovative solutions when it comes to housing."\nAfter Katrina struck in 2005, federal lawsuits accused FEMA of recklessly providing scores of storm victims with shoddily constructed trailers that exposed occupants to toxic fumes. FEMA, which stopped using the cramped travel trailers, has touted the safety features of its latest generation of mobile homes.\nLong, however, said manufactured housing will not be the primary way people in Texas and Florida are provided temporary housing in the coming months.\nHarvey flooded more than 79,000 homes with at least 18 inches of water, according to a FEMA official. More than 740,000 households have registered for FEMA aid, such as rental assistance and money for damage repairs. The agency already is paying for tens of thousands of Harvey victims to stay in hotels and motels in 33 states.\nLong is working with Texas Gov. Greg Abbott to find ways to get people back in their flood-damaged homes more quickly, without using manufactured housing.\n"The way we\'ve done business in the past has not necessarily been successful. It\'s been a frustrating road," Long said Friday.\nDuring a record-setting hurricane season in 2005, Katrina\'s devastation sent FEMA scrambling to meet the unprecedented need for temporary housing in Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama. Less than one month after Katrina\'s landfall, Hurricane Rita roared ashore and demolished roughly 23,000 more homes in Texas and Louisiana.\nFEMA purchased more than 140,000 new trailers and mobile homes to house Katrina and Rita victims near their storm-shattered properties or in makeshift trailer parks.\nBy March 2006, FEMA learned of concerns that travel trailers were exposing occupants to elevated formaldehyde levels. Formaldehyde, a chemical commonly found in building materials, can cause breathing problems and is classified as a carcinogen.\nMany trailer occupants began complaining of headaches, nosebleeds and difficulty breathing. Government tests on hundreds of trailers in Louisiana and Mississippi found formaldehyde levels that were, on average, about five times higher than in most modern homes.\nStorm victims\' attorneys accused the trailer makers of using substandard building materials and methods in a rush to fill FEMA\'s orders. The lawyers also claimed FEMA downplayed the formaldehyde concerns for months and initially balked at air quality tests to avoid legal liability.\nA team of attorneys sued the federal government and travel manufacturers on behalf of tens of thousands of storm victims. But a federal judge dismissed all claims against the federal government, ruling FEMA couldn\'t be held liable for deciding to use travel trailers after Katrina and Rita.\n"They\'re basically bullet-proof when it comes to deciding the type of emergency housing they provide," said Gerald Meunier, who was one of the lead plaintiffs\' attorneys for the litigation. "We said, \'It was a dumb choice. You just picked the wrong kind of housing.\'"\nMichael Byrne, FEMA\'s federal disaster recovery coordinator for Harvey, said the agency will be moving manufactured housing units into the flood-ravaged region "as the demand presents itself" to help state and local officials "fill the gap."\n"We\'re not going to put people in anything that\'s substandard," Byrne said. "We\'ve learned lessons."\nMore than 4,600 households in south Louisiana have lived in FEMA-supplied mobile homes since a storm dumped more than two feet of rain on parts of the region last summer, damaging or destroying tens of thousands of homes. Approximately 3,000 families, mostly in the Baton Rouge area, were still living in the "manufactured housing units" as of Thursday.\nFor nearly nine months, Misty Munsell has shared one of those mobile homes with her 64-year-old mother and 85-year-old grandmother.  The family moved in two days before Christmas, after waiting several weeks for FEMA contractors to finish installing it next to the moldy, gutted wreckage of their Baton Rouge house.\n"It doesn\'t feel like home, but we try," said Munsell, a 34-year-old emergency medical technician who helped rescue neighbors from last August\'s floodwaters.\nStorage space is limited, so their floors are cluttered with garbage bags filled with clean clothes and linens. Thunderstorms rattle their walls and windows. The smoke detector goes off if they cook with stovetop burners on their hottest setting. Raw sewage leaked from an unsealed pipe, and the nauseating smell lasted for days.\n"It\'s better than the alternative of nothing," said Munsell\'s mother, Linda Naquin.\nState Rep. Ted James, who lives in the same subdivision as Munsell\'s family, said he has seen the mobile homes arrive at a nearby staging area and sit unoccupied for weeks. The Democrat blames "federal red tape" for the slow pace.\n"I was disappointed with the entire process," James said. "It didn\'t seem to be coordinated at all. This happens yearly, and to continue to have these hiccups is unreal."\n'

aS' With a mass exodus of Rohingya Muslims sparking accusations of ethnic cleansing from the United Nations and others, Myanmar leader Aung San Suu Kyi on Tuesday said her country does not fear international scrutiny and invited diplomats to see some areas for themselves.\nThough an estimated 421,000 Rohingya have fled to Bangladesh in less than a month as their villages burned and hundreds were killed, Suu Kyi said the "great majority" of Muslims within the conflict zone stayed and that "more than 50 percent of their villages were intact."\nThe Nobel Peace laureate\'s global image has been damaged by violence since Rohingya insurgents attacked Myanmar security forces on Aug. 25. Rohingya fled their villages in the military crackdown that followed, and many of their villages have been burned. The government has blamed the Rohingya themselves, but members of the persecuted minority have said soldiers and Buddhist mobs attacked them.\nSuui Kyi\'s first address to the nation since the violence erupted came days after she canceled plans to attend the U.N. General Assembly, a decision widely seen as a response to international criticism.\nSuu Kyi said anyone found to have broken the law would be punished. "Human rights violations and all other acts that impair stability and harmony and undermine the rule of law will be addressed in accordance with strict laws and justice," she said.\nThe Rohingya, who live mainly in northern Rakhine state near the Bangladesh border, have had a long and troubled history in this predominantly Buddhist nation of 60 million.\nThough members of the long-persecuted religious minority first arrived in the western state of Rakhine generations ago, most people in Myanmar consider them to have migrated illegally from Bangladesh. Denied citizenship, they are effectively stateless. They cannot travel freely, practice their religion, or work as teachers or doctors, and they have little access to medical care, food or education.\nThe attacks on Rohingya villages in the last month appear to many to have been a systematic effort to drive them out. U.N. Secretary General Antonio Guterres has described it as ethnic cleansing.\nSatellite imagery released by Human Rights Watch on Tuesday shows massive swaths of scorched landscape and the near total destruction of 214 villages. Also Tuesday, a group that focuses on Rohingya rights said the attacks drove nearly all Rohingya out of one of the three northern Rakhine townships where the ethnic group is concentrated in Myanmar.\nThe Arakan Project found that almost every tract of villages in Maungdaw township suffered some burning. Most Rohingya villages in Rathedaung township also were targeted, but relatively few were hit in Buthidaung township.\nSuu Kyi sought to assure foreign diplomats gathered for her speech in Naypyitaw, the capital, that those who fled to Bangladesh would be allowed to return if they passed a "verification" process. She also said the government was working to restore normalcy in the area.\nThough fires have continued to flare in recent days in northern Rakhine state, she said "there have been no armed clashes and there have been no clearance operations" for the past two weeks.\n"Nevertheless we are concerned to hear that numbers of Muslims are fleeing across the border to Bangladesh," she said. "We want to understand why this exodus is happening. We would like to talk to those who have fled as well as those who have stayed."\nShe said she it would be helpful to understand why conflict did not break out everywhere. She invited the diplomats with visit villages that weren\'t affected so they could learn along with the government "why are they not at each other\'s throats in these particular areas."\nRohingya now in camps in Bangladesh were angered by the implication that Rohingya who were driven from their villages were themselves responsible, or that some members of the ethnic group are safe.\nIn the Kutupalong refugee camp, Abdul Hafiz said Rohingya once trusted Suu Kyi more than the military that not only ruled for half a century before, but also held her under house arrest for many years. Now Hafiz calls Suu Kyi a "liar" and says Rohingya are suffering more than ever.\nHe said Suu Kyi should give international journalists more access to their destroyed villages. If Rohingya are proven wrong that they were attacked, he said, "we will not mind if the world decides to kill us all by pushing us into the sea."\nChris Lewa, founder of the Arakan Project, said the government rules for verifying Rohingya as citizens are too strict, requiring documents dating back decades. "Many people would have lost their documents in the fires, and many children were already unregistered," she said.\nThose fires, she added, have destroyed thousands of homes. "So where are they going to go?" I hope not in segregated camps, as in Sittwe," a Rakhine state city where tens of thousands of Rohingya have been confined since another round of ethnic violence five years ago.\nSome observers who attended the speech said it was progress for Suu Kyi to invite diplomats to at least some Rohingya villages.\n"Today\'s welcoming of the international community to travel to Rakhine and see for ourselves what the situation is, I think that is a positive statement," said Andrew Kirkwood of the United Nations\' Office for Project Services.\nW. Patrick Murphy, U.S. Deputy Assistant Secretary for Southeast Asia, left the event without commenting.\nRussian and Chinese diplomats praised the speech. "The message is quite clear that Myanmar is ready to cooperate with the international community," said the Russian ambassador to Myanmar, Dr. Nikolay Listopadov.\nRights groups were far more critical. Amnesty International regional director James Gomez accused Suu Kyi of "a mix of untruths and victim-blaming."\n"There is overwhelming evidence that security forces are engaged in a campaign of ethnic cleansing," Gomez said. "While it was positive to hear Aung San Suu Kyi condemn human rights violations in Rakhine state, she is still silent about the role of the security forces in this."\nThe exodus continues to grow. The U.N.\'s migration agency on Tuesday raised its estimate of the number of refugees in Bangladesh to 421,000, and UNICEF says more than a quarter-million of those are children. Hundreds of thousands more Rohingya were already in Bangladesh from waves of violence years earlier.\nSpokesman Joel Millman of the International Organization for Migration says an estimated 20,000 people are flowing across Myanmar\'s border into Bangladesh every day.\n'

aS' For generations, Rohingya Muslims have called Myanmar home. Now, in what appears to be a systematic purge, the minority ethnic group is being wiped off the map.\nAfter a series of attacks by Muslim militants last month, security forces and allied mobs retaliated by burning down thousands of Rohingya homes in the predominantly Buddhist nation.\nMore than 500,000 people \xe2\x80\x94 roughly half their population \xe2\x80\x94 have fled to neighboring Bangladesh in the past year, most of them in the last three weeks.\nAnd they are still leaving, piling into wooden boats that take them to sprawling, monsoon-drenched refugee camps in Bangladesh. Their plight has been decried as ethnic cleansing by U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres. And despite assurances Tuesday by Myanmar\'s leader, Aung San Suu Kyi, few believe they will ever be welcomed back.\n"This is the worst crisis in Rohingya history," said Chris Lewa, founder of the Arakan Project, which works to improve conditions for the ethnic minority, citing the monumental size and speed of the exodus. "Security forces have been burning villages one by one, in a very systematic way. And it\'s still ongoing."\nUsing a network of monitors, Lewa and her agency are meticulously documenting tracts of villages that have been partially or completely burned down in three townships in northern Rakhine state, where the vast majority of Myanmar\'s 1.1 million Rohingya once lived. It\'s a painstaking task because there are hundreds of them, and information is almost impossible to verify because the army has blocked access to the area. Satellite imagery released by Human Rights Watch on Tuesday shows massive swaths of scorched landscape and the near total destruction of 214 villages.\nThe Arakan Project said Tuesday that almost every tract of villages in Maungdaw township suffered some burning, and that it has been almost completely abandoned by Rohingya.\nSixteen of the 21 Rohingya villages in the northern part of Rathedaung township \xe2\x80\x94 in eight village tracts \xe2\x80\x94 were targeted. Three camps for Rohingya who were displaced in communal riots five years ago also were torched.\nButhidaung, to the east, so far has been largely spared. It is the only township where security operations appear limited to areas where the attacks by Rohingya militants, which triggered the ongoing crackdown, occurred. Separated from the other Rohingya townships by mountains, and with more Buddhists and more soldiers, Buthidaung has historically had fewer tensions.\nIn a speech Tuesday, Suu Kyi noted that most Rohingya villages did not suffer violence, and said the government would look into "why are they not at each other\'s throats in these particular areas." Rohingya refugees angrily viewed that as the government deflecting blame for attacks by its own forces.\nThe Rohingya have had a long and troubled history in Myanmar, where many in the country\'s 60 million people look on them with disdain.\nThough members of the ethnic minority first arrived generations ago, Rohingya were stripped of their citizenship in 1982, denying them almost all rights and rendering them stateless. They cannot travel freely, practice their religion, or work as teachers or doctors, and they have little access to medical care, food or education.\nThe U.N. has labeled the Rohingya one of the world\'s most persecuted religious minorities.\nStill, if it weren\'t for their safety, many would rather live in Myanmar than be forced to another country that doesn\'t want them.\n"Now we can\'t even buy plastic to make a shelter," said 32-year-old Kefayet Ullah of the camp in Bangladesh where he and his family are struggling to get from one day to the next.\nIn Rakhine, they had land for farming and a small shop. Now they have nothing.\n"Our heart is crying for our home," he said, tears streaming down his face. "Even the father of my grandfather was born in Myanmar."\nThis is not the first time the Rohingya have fled en masse.\nHundreds of thousands left in 1978 and again in the early 1990s, fleeing military and government oppression, though policies were later put in place that allowed many to return. Communal violence in 2012, as the country was transitioning from a half-century of dictatorship to democracy, sent another 100,000 fleeing by boat. Some 120,000 remain trapped in camps under apartheid-like conditions outside Rakhine\'s capital, Sittwe.\nBut no exodus has been as massive and swift as the one taking place now.\nThe military crackdown came in retaliation for a series of coordinated attacks by Rohingya militants led by Attaullah Abu Ammar Jununi, who was born in Pakistan and raised in Saudi Arabia.\nLast October, the militants struck police posts, killing several officers and triggering a brutal military response that sent 87,000 Rohingya fleeing. Then on Aug. 25, a day after a state-appointed commission of inquiry headed by former U.N. chief Kofi Annan released a report about the earlier bloodshed, the militants struck again.\nThey attacked more than 30 police and army posts, causing casualties.\nIt was the excuse security forces wanted. They hit back and hard. Together with Buddhist mobs, they burned down villages, killed, looted and raped.\nThat sent a staggering 421,000 fleeing as of Tuesday, according to U.N. estimates.\n"The military crackdown resembles a cynical ploy to forcibly transfer large numbers of people without possibility of return," Zeid Ra\'ad al-Hussein, the U.N. high commissioner for human rights, said earlier this month in Geneva, calling it a "textbook example of ethnic cleansing."\nIt could be months before the extent of the devastation is clear because the army has blocked access to the affected areas. Yanghee Lee, the U.N. Special Rapporteur on the human rights situation in Myanmar, said at least 1,000 civilians were killed. The government claims more than 400 died, the vast majority Rohingya militants. They put the number of civilians killed at 30.\nWhether it\'s the end game for the Rohingya in Myanmar remains to be seen, said Richard Horsey, a political analyst in Yangon. It depends in part on whether arrangements will be made by Bangladesh and Myanmar for their eventual return and the extent of the destruction.\n"We are still waiting for a full picture of how many villages are depopulated versus how many were destroyed," he said.\n'

aS' Protesters chanting "free our people" gathered outside the jail in downtown St. Louis for more than two hours to show solidarity with those arrested during demonstrations that turned ugly over the weekend, but there was no new vandalism overnight.\nDemonstrators outside the jail late Monday criticized authorities for keeping some of those arrested in jail for nearly 24 hours after they were taken into custody. Police said more than 120 people were arrested during Sunday\'s protests over the acquittal of a white former police officer in the killing of a black suspect.\nSome of those jailed were released Monday evening before organizers announced an end to the demonstration and told people to go home. Organizers said protests will resume Tuesday, but they gave no details.\nMonday was the fourth day of protests.\nThree days of peaceful protests and three nights of vandalism followed Friday\'s announcement that a judge found ex-officer Jason Stockley not guilty in the 2011 death of Anthony Lamar Smith.\nSmith\'s mother, Anne Smith, was among those gathered outside the downtown jail Monday.\nHundreds of riot police mobilized downtown late Sunday, arresting more than 80 people at one intersection who police said didn\'t follow orders to disperse. Earlier, police had responded to reports of property damage and vandalism.\nBut Sean Porter, 25, of St. Louis, was among those arrested at the intersection. He said they could not follow orders to disperse because police had them blocked in.\n"They threw us on the ground, sprayed us, hit us, everything. It\'s tragic," said Porter, who was released from jail Monday evening. He was charged with failure to disperse.\nThe St. Louis Post-Dispatch said reporter Mike Faulk, who was on the street covering the protests, had an experience similar to the one Porter described.\nPolice blocked all four sides of the intersection using a corralling technique called kettling. Faulk heard the police command to move back, but he had nowhere to go, the newspaper reported. Multiple officers knocked Faulk down, he told the Post-Dispatch, and pinned his limbs to the ground. A foot pushed his head into the pavement and he was squirted with pepper spray after he was subdued, he said.\nSeveral others caught in the box made by rows of riot police said the officers overstepped their bounds and used excessive force on non-protesters, including residents trying to get home.\nTony Rothert, legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Missouri, said his office has been busy fielding complaints and is "exploring whether litigation will be necessary to bring police in line with the Constitution."\nPolice said anyone who wants to make a complaint can contact the Internal Affairs Division.\nProtesters had marched peacefully through St. Louis\' posh Central West End and the trendy Delmar Loop area of nearby University City during daylight hours on Friday and Saturday. Protesters also marched through two shopping malls in a wealthy area of St. Louis County. On Sunday, more than 1,000 people had gathered at police headquarters and then marched without trouble through downtown St. Louis. Silent protesters marched arm-in-arm to city hall during the Monday morning rush hour crush.\nBut on Sunday night, 100 or so people who remained on the street grew agitated, knocking over planters, breaking shop and hotel windows, and scattering plastic chairs at an outdoor venue as they headed downtown.\nThey were met with riot police who made the arrests and seized at least five weapons, according to Interim Police Chief Lawrence O\'Toole. Later, officers in riot gear gathered alongside a city boulevard chanting "whose street, our street" \xe2\x80\x94 a common refrain used by the protesters \xe2\x80\x94 after clearing the street of demonstrators and onlookers.\nStockley shot Smith after high-speed chase as officers tried to arrest Smith and his partner in a suspected drug deal. Stockley, 36, testified he felt endangered because he saw Smith holding a silver revolver when Smith backed his car toward the officers and sped away.\nProsecutors said Stockley planted a gun in Smith\'s car after the shooting. The officer\'s DNA was on the weapon but Smith\'s wasn\'t. Dashcam video from Stockley\'s cruiser recorded him saying he was "going to kill this (expletive)." Less than a minute later, he shot Smith five times.\nStockley\'s lawyer dismissed the comment as "human emotions" during a dangerous pursuit. St. Louis Circuit Judge Timothy Wilson, who said prosecutors didn\'t prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Stockley murdered Smith, said the statement could be ambiguous.\nStockley left the police department and moved to Houston three years ago.\n'

aS' Toys \'R\' Us, the toy retailer struggling with $5 billion in debt and intense online competition, has filed for bankruptcy protection ahead of the key holiday shopping season \xe2\x80\x94 and says its stores will remain open for business as usual.\nThe company said the proceedings are a way for Toys \'R\' Us to work with its creditors on restructuring the debt beleaguering it. And it emphasized that its stores worldwide will serve customers while it works with suppliers and sells merchandise.\nFiling for bankruptcy protection "will provide us with greater financial flexibility to invest in our business ... and strengthen our competitive position in an increasingly challenging and rapidly changing retail marketplace worldwide," Chairman and CEO Dave Brandon said.\nThe move comes as retailers head into the busiest shopping time of year. The company said it was "well-stocked as we prepare for the holiday season and are excited about all of our upcoming in-store events."\nRetailers of all kinds are struggling. The Toys \'R\' Us bankruptcy filing joins a list of at least 18 others since the beginning of the year \xe2\x80\x94 including shoe chain Payless Shoe Source, children\'s clothing chain Gymboree Corp. and the True Religion jean brand \xe2\x80\x94 as people shop less in stores and more online.\n"Toys \'R\' Us had little choice but to restructure and try to put itself on a firmer footing, said Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData Retail. However, he added, "even if the debt issues are solved, Toys \'R\' Us still faces massive structural challenges against which it must battle."\nToys \'R\' Us, a major force in toy retailing in the 1980s and early 1990s, started losing shoppers to discounters like Walmart and Target and then to Amazon. GlobalData Retail estimates that in 2016 about 13.7 percent of toy sales were made online, up from 6.5 percent five years ago.\nAnd children are increasingly moving more toward mobile devices as playthings. "For many children, electronics have become a replacement or a substitute for traditional toys," Saunders said.\nToys \'R\' Us has struggled with debt since private-equity firms Bain Capital, KKR & Co. and Vornado Realty Trust took it private in a $6.6 billion leveraged buyout in 2005. The plan had been to take the company public, but that never happened because of its weak financial performance.\nWith such debt levels, Toys \'R\' Us has not had the financial flexibility to invest in its business. Marc Rosenberg, a toy marketing executive, said Toys \'R\' Us hasn\'t been aggressive about building its online business, and let those sales migrate to rivals. And he says the company should have also thought of new ways to attract more customers in its stores, such as hosting birthday parties.\n"Everyone is shopping online and using the store as a showcase," he said.\nRandy Watson of Fort Worth, Texas, used to pick up items at Toys \'R\' Us for his kids. But now with his grandchildren, he uses the store to see what\'s available and then shops elsewhere to get lower prices.\n"We will go to Toys \'R\' Us to check out the current toys, and while we are at the store, we will be looking up prices on the phone on Walmart.com and Amazon," he said.\nWhat he finds on the shelves might be a question. Jeffries analyst Stephanie Wissink said she expects that Toys \'R\' Us suppliers, who were already shifting some of their orders to other stores amid talk there\'d be a bankruptcy filing, will keep doing so.  For most multinational toy suppliers, the Toys \'R\' Us business roughly accounted for 10 percent of total sales, she said.\nWhile toy sales overall have held up fairly well, they are shifting toward discounters and online companies. U.S. toy sales rose 6 percent last year on top of a 7 percent increase in the prior year, says NPD Group Inc., a market research firm. That was the biggest increase since 1999 and was fueled by several blockbuster movies.\nBut for the first half of 2017, sales rose 3 percent. That puts more pressure on the later part of the year, when most toy sales occur, for the industry to meet NPD\'s estimate for a 4.5 percent annual increase. Lego is laying off 1,400 workers after saying profits and sales dropped in the first half. And the nation\'s two largest toy makers, Mattel and Hasbro, reported disappointing second-quarter results.\nToys \'R\' Us, based in Wayne, New Jersey, announced the filing late Monday. It said it was voluntarily seeking relief through the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Eastern District of Virginia in Richmond, and that its Canadian subsidiary would be seeking similar protection through a Canadian court in Ontario as it seeks to reorganize.\nThe company said separate operations outside the U.S. and Canada are not part of the filings and its online sales sites worldwide remain open for business during the court-supervised process.\n"The company\'s approximately 1,600 Toys \'R\' Us and Babies \'R\' Us stores around the world \xe2\x80\x94 the vast majority of which are profitable \xe2\x80\x94 are continuing to operate as usual," the \n said. "Customers can also continue to shop for the toy and baby products they are looking for online."\nToys \'R\' Us said it expects to continue honoring return policies, warranties and gift cards, and customer loyalty programs should stay the same.\nThe company has nearly 65,000 employees worldwide.\n'

aS' Jose Luis Millan found a new crop of star employees at an upscale Tijuana car wash where customers cross the border from the U.S. to pay up to $950 to have their prized possessions steamed and scrubbed for hours. They\'re never late, always hustle and come in on days off to learn new skills, traits that he says make them a model for their Mexican counterparts.\nThey are among several thousand Haitians who came to Mexico\'s northwest corner hoping to cross the border before the U.S. abruptly closed its doors last year. The Mexican government has welcomed them, with a visa program that helps them fill the need for labor in Tijuana\'s growing economy.\nIn a country whose population is 1 percent black, Tijuana\'s Haitians stand out. They share tight living quarters, sending much of their meager wages to support family in Haiti. Haitians earn far less than they would in the United States but enough to forsake the risk of getting deported by heading north.\nTwo new Haitian restaurants downtown serve dishes with mangoes and mashed plantains. Dozens of Haitian children attend public schools. Factories that export to the U.S. recruit Haitians, who can also be found waiting tables and worshipping at congregations that added services in Creole.\n"It\'s the Mexican dream for many of them, a sense that they belong," Millan said. "Mexico has given them opportunity. Mexico has opened up and let them achieve their dreams."\nMillan, who lived in the Los Angeles area for two decades until he was forced to leave last year for employing dozens of people illegally at his party planning company, sees parallels to Mexicans in the U.S. Their teamwork sets an example. Some customers ask for them.\nHaitians, he says, "fight hard, fight strong, and they don\'t stop."\nThe Haitians took an accidental route from their impoverished Caribbean homeland to Tijuana, a city of about 2 million that borders San Diego and also has large pockets of Chinese and Korean immigrants.\nBrazil and its neighbors took in the Haitians after that country\'s 2010 earthquake. As construction jobs for the 2016 Summer Olympics ended and Brazil descended into political turmoil, they crossed 10 countries by plane, boat, bus and on foot to San Diego, where U.S. authorities let them in on humanitarian grounds.\nThen President Barack Obama shifted course in September and started deporting Haitian arrivals. Many decided to call Mexico home.\nAfter struggling as a schoolteacher in Haiti, Abelson Etienne moved to Brazil in 2014 to work at a factory that made cable for lighting products. He arrived in Tijuana in December after a harrowing journey with his wife who, despite the U.S. policy shift, was allowed in on humanitarian grounds, presumably because she was seven months\' pregnant.\nEtienne, a 27-year-old who studied chemistry in college in Haiti, settled into a routine of six-day weeks and three double shifts, earning him 1,900 pesos (a little over $100), mostly for his wife in New York City and the infant son he hasn\'t seen. On Sundays, he sleeps until the afternoon and goes to church.\n"There\'s so much work in Tijuana," he said while a pot of fish stew with mangoes and tomatoes simmered on an electric burner in the two-room apartment that he rents with three other Haitians. "I\'ve been treated very well in Mexico."\nThe Mexican government is giving Haitians one-year, renewable visas that allow them to work but not bring family. Rodulfo Figueroa, the region\'s top immigration official, says Mexico is practicing what it asks of the U.S. and other countries.\n"We believe that there\'s a humanitarian case to be made for these people to find better lives in Mexico," said Figueroa, the National Migration Institute\'s delegate in Baja California state, which includes Tijuana. "Our policy is to have the Haitian population do what they need to do to have status in Mexico."\nThe new arrivals, currently numbering around 3,000, are manageable in a country of 122 million. Central Americans, who come illegally in much larger numbers, are typically deported, although Mexico is granting asylum more often.\nRodin St. Surin, 36, is among hundreds of Haitians who found work at Tijuana\'s export-oriented factories. CCL Industries Inc., a Toronto-based company that makes Avery office products for retailers including Staples, Wal-Mart, Target and others, needed help after moving manufacturing from Meridian, Mississippi, last year.\nThe plant hired St. Surin and 15 other Haitians in May for its workforce of 1,700 during peak back-to-school season. They inspected and packaged binders at the back of a giant, spotless floor where machines also churn out labels, folders and markers around-the-clock.\n"I\'m very comfortable with these people," said Mario Aguirre, the plant\'s operations director and a 43-year industry veteran. "They have given us very good results. They don\'t miss work, they always arrive on time. We\'d like to see the same attitude in everyone."\nThe factory offered 1,500 pesos (about $85) for a six-day week, with health coverage, paid vacation and a free shuttle to work. St. Surin, who left Brazil with hopes of joining a cousin in Miami, sends earnings to a caretaker for his three children in Haiti, whom he hopes to bring to Tijuana.\n"Mexico could become my home," he said outside a crowded, graffiti-covered building where a nun allows about 50 Haitians to live rent-free on a street shared by cars and stray dogs. They tap a neighbor\'s hose for water to bathe, and cook meals on a campfire under a large canopy.\nThe Ambassadors of Jesus Church, which sits on a rugged dirt road lined by agave and used tires, housed up to 500 Haitians last year on floors strewn with mattresses, making it perhaps the largest religious or civic aid group. Its pastor, Jeccene Thimote, wants to build a "Little Haiti" of 100 houses nearby at the bottom of a canyon where the sound of peacocks and roosters and smell of pigs permeate the air. He built three houses before the city halted construction for lack of flood controls.\nThimote, 32, survives on two hours\' sleep, rising to pray at 5 a.m., serving as foreman for a crew of 10 Haitians building a house in one of Tijuana\'s wealthiest neighborhoods, and working the night shift at RSI Home Products Inc., a California-based company that makes cabinetry for The Home Depot and Lowe\'s.\nThimote, who was among 160 Haitians still living rent-free at the church this summer, sends his earnings to Haiti to settle family debts and support a 3-year-old daughter. He hoped to join a cousin in New York when he left Ecuador last year, but considers Mexico better than Haiti, saying, "There\'s more poverty there than here."\nThe church has adapted. Every Wednesday night, Haitians gather for a rousing sermon in Creole. Mexicans attend a Sunday service in Spanish. A Haitian and Mexican recently announced plans to marry at the church.\n'

aS' The blaring, grinding noise jolted the American diplomat from his bed in a Havana hotel. He moved just a few feet, and there was silence. He climbed back into bed. Inexplicably, the agonizing sound hit him again. It was as if he\'d walked through some invisible wall cutting straight through his room.\nSoon came the hearing loss, and the speech problems, symptoms both similar and altogether different from others among at least 21 U.S. victims in an astonishing international mystery still unfolding in Cuba. The top U.S. diplomat has called them "health attacks." New details learned by The Associated Press indicate at least some of the incidents were confined to specific rooms or even parts of rooms with laser-like specificity, baffling U.S. officials who say the facts and the physics don\'t add up.\n"None of this has a reasonable explanation," said Fulton Armstrong, a former CIA official who served in Havana long before America re-opened an embassy there. "It\'s just mystery after mystery after mystery."\nSuspicion initially focused on a sonic weapon, and on the Cubans. Yet the diagnosis of mild brain injury, considered unlikely to result from sound, has confounded the FBI, the State Department and U.S. intelligence agencies involved in the investigation.\nSome victims now have problems concentrating or recalling specific words, several officials said, the latest signs of more serious damage than the U.S. government initially realized. The United States first acknowledged the attacks in August \xe2\x80\x94 nine months after symptoms were first reported.\nIt may seem the stuff of sci-fi novels, of the cloak-and-dagger rivalries that haven\'t fully dissipated despite the historic U.S.-Cuban rapprochement two years ago that seemed to bury the weight of the two nations\' Cold War enmity. But this is Cuba, the land of poisoned cigars, exploding seashells and covert subterfuge by Washington and Havana, where the unimaginable in espionage has often been all too real.\nThe Trump administration still hasn\'t identified a culprit or a device to explain the attacks, according to interviews with more than a dozen current and former U.S. officials, Cuban officials and others briefed on the investigation. Most weren\'t authorized to discuss the probe and demanded anonymity.\nIn fact, almost nothing about what went down in Havana is clear. Investigators have tested several theories about an intentional attack \xe2\x80\x94 by Cuba\'s government, a rogue faction of its security forces, a third country like Russia, or some combination thereof. Yet they\'ve left open the possibility an advanced espionage operation went horribly awry, or that some other, less nefarious explanation is to blame.\nAside from their homes, officials said Americans were attacked in at least one hotel, a fact not previously disclosed. An incident occurred on an upper floor of the recently renovated Hotel Capri, a 60-year-old concrete tower steps from the Malecon, Havana\'s iconic, waterside promenade.\nThe cases vary deeply: different symptoms, different recollections of what happened. That\'s what makes the puzzle so difficult to crack.\nIn several episodes recounted by U.S. officials, victims knew it was happening in real time, and there were strong indications of a sonic attack.\nSome felt vibrations, and heard sounds \xe2\x80\x94 loud ringing or a high-pitch chirping similar to crickets or cicadas. Others heard the grinding noise. Some victims awoke with ringing in their ears and fumbled for their alarm clocks, only to discover the ringing stopped when they moved away from their beds.\nThe attacks seemed to come at night. Several victims reported they came in minute-long bursts.\nYet others heard nothing, felt nothing. Later, their symptoms came.\nThe scope keeps widening. On Tuesday, the State Department disclosed that doctors had confirmed another two cases, bringing the total American victims to 21. Some have mild traumatic brain injury, known as a concussion, and others permanent hearing loss.\nEven the potential motive is unclear. Investigators are at a loss to explain why Canadians were harmed, too, including some who reported nosebleeds. Fewer than 10 Canadian diplomatic households in Cuba were affected, a Canadian official said. Unlike the U.S., Canada has maintained warm ties to Cuba for decades.\nSound and health experts are equally baffled. Targeted, localized beams of sound are possible, but the laws of acoustics suggest such a device would probably be large and not easily concealed. Officials said it\'s unclear whether the device\'s effects were localized by design or due to some other technical factor.\nAnd no single, sonic gadget seems to explain such an odd, inconsistent array of physical responses.\n"Brain damage and concussions, it\'s not possible," said Joseph Pompei, a former MIT researcher and psychoacoustics expert. "Somebody would have to submerge their head into a pool lined with very powerful ultrasound transducers."\nOther symptoms have included brain swelling, dizziness, nausea, severe headaches, balance problems and tinnitus, or prolonged ringing in the ears. Many victims have shown improvement since leaving Cuba and some suffered only minor or temporary symptoms.\nAfter the U.S. complained to Cuba\'s government earlier this year and Canada detected its own cases, the FBI and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police traveled to Havana to investigate.\nFBI investigators swept the rooms, looking for devices. They found nothing, several officials briefed on the investigation said.\nIn May, Washington expelled two Cuban diplomats to protest the communist government\'s failure to protect Americans serving there. But the U.S. has taken pains not to accuse Havana of perpetrating the attacks. It\'s a sign investigators believe that even if elements of Cuba\'s security forces were involved, it wasn\'t necessarily directed from the top.\nCuba\'s government declined to answer specific questions about the incidents, pointing to a previous Foreign Affairs Ministry statement denying any involvement, vowing full cooperation and saying it was treating the situation "with utmost importance."\n"Cuba has never, nor would it ever, allow that the Cuban territory be used for any action against accredited diplomatic agents or their families, without exception," the Cuban statement said.\nAfter half a century of estrangement, the U.S. and Cuba in 2015 restored diplomatic ties between countries separated by a mere 90 miles of water. Embassies were re-opened and restrictions on travel and commerce eased. President Donald Trump has reversed some of those changes, but left others in place.\nMark Feierstein, who oversaw the Cuba detente on President Barack Obama\'s National Security Council, noted that Cuban authorities have been uncharacteristically cooperative with the investigation.\nIf the Trump administration felt confident Raul Castro\'s government was to blame, it\'s likely the U.S. would have already taken major punitive steps, like shuttering the newly re-established American Embassy. And the U.S. hasn\'t stopped sending new diplomats to Cuba even as the victim list grows.\n"Had they thought the Cuban government was deliberately attacking American diplomats, that would have had a much more negative effect," Feierstein said. "We haven\'t seen that yet."\n'

aS'In less than a decade, the world went from worrying about financial crashes to worrying about crashing democracies.\nStarting in 2008, we were distressed over which economy would topple next, or whether the next banking crisis would wipe out people\xe2\x80\x99s savings. Yet the Great Recession was not as prolonged as we feared \xe2\x80\x94 the hardest-hit economies have recovered, or are in the process of doing so.\nWhat has not returned to precrisis mode is politics. Today political parties \xe2\x80\x94 essential to strong democratic systems \xe2\x80\x94 are becoming something of an endangered species.\nThe aftermath of the economic downturn paved the way for the success of nontraditional political leaders like Donald Trump and made viable some once-unimaginable ideas, like \n.\nLongstanding trends also took a stronger hold in the West. As salaries stagnated or even declined in the United States, Britain and other economically advanced democracies, the embattled middle class blamed \n and globalization. Immigration and international trade were seen as costly downsides to international integration.\nSurprisingly, even emerging markets with fast-growing economies and stellar records of lifting people out of poverty, like Brazil, faced challenges from angry populations disappointed with their governments and empowered by social media and other new technologies.\nIn developing countries, it is common for people\xe2\x80\x99s expectations to grow at a faster pace than the capacity of the state to meet them. Money is always short, and public institutions are often ineffective. So even though the lives of hundreds of millions of people in Asia, Latin America and Africa are improving, that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean that people are content. And it has become clear that economic progress and prosperity do not always buy political stability.\nThe global wave of political anger sweeping many rich and poor countries alike is also fed by a newfound impatience with corruption.\nIn the last decade, societies in which corruption used to be treated as a fact of life developed a strong intolerance to official thievery and ousted once-untouchable politicians. In Brazil and India, Russia and Spain, people took to the streets to denounce corruption by the powerful.\nAnd too often those in power were also leaders of traditional political parties. When such leaders are caught stealing, it becomes another stain on parties, whose prestige and allure have been steadily waning. These days, political parties are seen not as natural habitats for idealists but for fast-talking and often hypocritical opportunists and careerists.\nThe disdain for politics as usual \xe2\x80\x94 and therefore for parties locked in the status quo \xe2\x80\x94 is intense, widespread, global. This is why anti-politics\nthe rejection of traditional politics and its practitioners\nis such a popular instinct today.\nThe case of Tiririca vividly illustrates why. In 2010 Francisco Everardo Oliveira Silva, known professionally as \n, ran for a congressional seat in Brazil, campaigning in costume. His message was honest and straightforward: \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know what a representative in Congress does, but if you send me there I will tell you.\xe2\x80\x9d He also explained that his goal was \xe2\x80\x9cto help people in need in this country \xe2\x80\xa6 but especially my family.\xe2\x80\x9d\nAt the time, it was easy to dismiss Tiririca\xe2\x80\x99s run as an extreme anti-political gesture that could happen only in a rowdy young democracy like Brazil\xe2\x80\x99s. But not for long. The sentiment that propelled Tiririca to victory is similar to that which drove the political success of the comedian \n in Italy, or that of Mr. Trump, a reality TV show host.\nBoth men were able to undermine the power of dominant parties. While Mr. Grillo\xe2\x80\x99s \n sought to displace Italy\xe2\x80\x99s political machine by positioning himself as a radical outsider, Mr. Trump took on traditional politics as a radical insider, staging a hostile takeover of the Republican Party.\nMr. Trump\xe2\x80\x99s appeal to \n in Washington. Mr. Grillo\xe2\x80\x99s scorching denunciation of the \xe2\x80\x9ccaste\xe2\x80\x9d that in his view ran Italy to the ground. Demonstrators\xe2\x80\x99 banners in Brazil imploring voters to \xe2\x80\x9cthrow them all out.\xe2\x80\x9d These examples resonate in similar ways.\nThese days, calls for a new political order usually require the ouster of political parties and elected leaders, and in many cases that is the correct call. Corrupt and ineffectual organizations need to be replaced by effective ones.\nYet many activists harbor the misconception that the answer lies in nongovernmental organizations, or in loose, nonhierarchical movements.\nDemocracies, however, need political parties. We need permanent organizations that earn political power and govern, that are forced to articulate disparate interests and viewpoints, that can recruit and develop future government leaders and that monitor those already in power.\nPolitical leaders need to have a stance on preschool education and nuclear weapons, health care and agriculture, and have well-articulated views on fighting terrorism and regulating banks, among myriad other policy issues. And political parties are the training camps of these leaders.\nTo survive, political parties must regain the ability to inspire and mobilize people \xe2\x80\x94 especially the young \xe2\x80\x94 who might otherwise disdain politics or prefer to channel whatever political energy they have through single-issue groups. Parties must be willing to overhaul their structures, mind-sets and methods to adapt to a new world. We also need to bring party renewal to the foreground in any discussion of contemporary politics.\nIn the decade since the financial crisis, almost everything we do \xe2\x80\x94 eating, reading, shopping, dating, traveling and communicating \xe2\x80\x94 was disrupted by new technologies and innovation. Everything, that is, except the way we govern ourselves.\nWe need a disruptive innovation that pulls democratic parties into the 21st century.\n'

aS'When George Washington gave his Farewell Address in 1796, he urged the American people \xe2\x80\x9cto be constantly awake\xe2\x80\x9d to the risk of foreign influence. In the wake of Russia\xe2\x80\x99s meddling in the 2016 United States election, the president\xe2\x80\x99s warning has a fresh, chilling resonance.\nThe debate in the United States about foreign interference concentrates on who did what to influence last year\xe2\x80\x99s election and the need for democracies to strengthen their cybersecurity for emails, critical infrastructure and voting platforms. But we need to pay far more attention to another vulnerability: our adversaries\xe2\x80\x99 attempts to subvert our democratic processes by aiming falsehoods at ripe subsets of our population \xe2\x80\x94 and not only during elections.\nIn the Cold War era, Soviet attempts to meddle in American democracy were largely unsuccessful. In 1982 Yuri Andropov, then the K.G.B. chairman, told Soviet foreign intelligence officers to incorporate disinformation operations \xe2\x80\x94 the so-called active measures meant to discredit adversaries and influence public opinion \xe2\x80\x94 into their standard work. They had an ambitious aim: preventing Ronald Reagan\xe2\x80\x99s re-election.\nSoviet agents were instructed to infiltrate party and campaign staffs in the United States in search of embarrassing information to leak to the press, while Soviet propagandists pushed a set of anti-Reagan story lines to the Western media. Ultimately, they failed to influence the election. President Reagan defeated Walter F. Mondale, winning 49 states. Margaret Thatcher, who was similarly targeted, also won re-election in a landslide.\nWhat exactly has changed since then to make foreign propaganda far more dangerous today?\nDuring the Cold War, most Americans received their news and information via mediated platforms. Reporters and editors serving in the role of professional gatekeepers had almost full control over what appeared in the media. A foreign adversary seeking to reach American audiences did not have great options for bypassing these umpires, and Russian dezinformatsia rarely penetrated.\nWhile television remains the main source of news for most Americans, viewers today tend to select a network in line with their political preferences. Even more significantly, The \n Research Center has found that two-thirds of Americans are getting at least some of their news through social media.\nAfter the election, around 84 percent of Americans polled by Pew described themselves as at least somewhat confident in their ability to discern real news from fake. This confidence may be misplaced.\nThe sheer quantity of shares that misleading stories get on Facebook is staggering. Using a database of 156 election-related news stories that fact-checking websites deemed false, economists from New York University and Stanford University \n that these false stories had been shared by American social media users 38 million times in the three months before the 2016 presidential election.\nRussia has keenly exploited our growing reliance on new media \xe2\x80\x94 and the absence of real umpires. Last year the Russian government supplemented the growing reach of its state-owned, English-language media outlets \xe2\x80\x94 RT and Sputnik \xe2\x80\x94 by employing a network of trolls, bots and thousands of fake Twitter and Facebook accounts that amplified damaging stories on Hillary Clinton.\nRussia appears to have deployed similar measures in Europe. Hackers\xe2\x80\x99 attempts to influence political outcomes in France and Germany have received significant attention, but interference has been widespread. In Bulgaria, cyberattacks believed to originate from Russia have hit the country\xe2\x80\x99s electoral commission, while in Sweden, Kremlin-funded media outlets have been accused of fabricating stories to rally public opinion against NATO membership. Russia has had time to refine these strategies in the oft-overlooked disinformation campaigns that accompanied Russia\xe2\x80\x99s military incursions into Georgia and Ukraine, and the now-familiar mix of trolls, bots and state-sponsored journalism was also used in attempts to deflect responsibility onto the United States for the 2014 \n.\nIn the United States, the vulnerability to foreign influence is exacerbated by divisions within the political establishment. During the Cold War, the larger struggle against communism created a mainstream consensus about what America stood for and against. Today, our society appears to be defined by a particularly vicious form of \xe2\x80\x9cpartyism\xe2\x80\x9d affecting Democrats and Republicans alike. This divisive environment can make the media more susceptible to repeating and amplifying falsehoods.\nThese days, the walls of our media echo chambers are so soundproof that, even after Russian President Vladimir Putin\xe2\x80\x99s well-documented interference in the United States election, and his many offenses in Ukraine and Syria, his favorability among Republicans \n substantially between 2015 and President Trump\xe2\x80\x99s inauguration, from 12 percent to 32 percent.\nMost worrisome, many Americans are questioning not only whether they are obtaining objective facts \xe2\x80\x94 60 percent believe news stories today are \xe2\x80\x9coften inaccurate,\xe2\x80\x9d according to \n, a major increase from 34 percent in 1985 \xe2\x80\x94 but also whether objective facts exist at all. The sense of an epistemological free-for-all provides an opening to all comers.\nAnother reason for concern is that in 2017 any well-financed actor \xe2\x80\x94 political campaigns, companies, foreign governments \xe2\x80\x94 can harvest data (location, age, gender, likes, shares) on its target audience, personalizing messages to suit the taste of those it aims to reach and employing this customized propaganda to skew the political debate. \n have likely reached millions of Americans, and some were geographically directed.\nBecause of the attention to last year\xe2\x80\x99s Russian election meddling, there is a risk that going forward we will be inclined to \xe2\x80\x9cfight the last war\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 mobilizing our defenses with a focus on Russia or on the next election cycle. But we must be on our guard toward all adversaries at all times.\nAt the height of its military successes, the Islamic State was releasing 38 pieces of news and propaganda on social media daily, the majority of which was used to attract potential recruits by falsely, but persuasively, \n in ISIS-held territory.\nThe bipartisan Alliance for Securing Democracy, meanwhile, has begun tracking and exposing Russia\xe2\x80\x99s extensive disinformation efforts in the here and now.\nFor example, the alliance documented how on the same day in August when Mr. Trump signed a bill imposing significant sanctions on Russia, the top story promoted by Russian-associated Twitter accounts concerned Mrs. Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s links to foreign arms sales. More recently, the alliance showed how Russia-linked accounts promoted alt-right conspiracies about the violence in Charlottesville, Va., as well as stories that slammed those \xe2\x80\x94 like Senator John McCain \xe2\x80\x94 who had criticized Mr. Trump\xe2\x80\x99s equivocal response.\nThis new\n is evocative of a series of special reports by the United States State Department that in the 1980s sought to undermine Soviet fake news by exposing Moscow\xe2\x80\x99s attempts to influence the American public.\nIt is a testament to our times that it now seems unthinkable that the State Department \xe2\x80\x94 much less the president \xe2\x80\x94 would publicly call out the misinformation being spread. But now that there is a genuine risk of foreign powers who, in George Washington\xe2\x80\x99s words, \xe2\x80\x9cpractice the arts of seduction, to mislead public opinion,\xe2\x80\x9d it is incumbent on the rest of us to enhance our vigilance.\n'

aS'LONDON \xe2\x80\x94 I think David Cameron was the worst prime minister Britain has had in the 40 years I\xe2\x80\x99ve been alive, but his replacement, Theresa May, is competing hard for the title. She has jettisoned the strategic sense that was Mr. Cameron\xe2\x80\x99s only worthwhile talent, and has scrapped his best initiative: fighting international corruption and tax evasion with financial transparency.\n leaked in 2015 showed how years earlier Swiss bankers had conspired with wealthy Westerners to help them dodge taxes. Last year, the \n revealed the use of shell companies to help corrupt officials hide their money.\nThis month, journalists in a dozen countries uncovered how \n had laundered billions of dollars through companies in Britain with accounts at a Danish bank in Estonia, for the benefit of people in Germany, France, Iran, Kazakhstan, Britain and elsewhere. Similar scams have involved officials throughout the world, from \n to \n.\nThe charge sheet against Mr. Cameron is common knowledge. It was he who gave us Brexit, by \n demanded primarily by a few dozen golf-club bores in his own party. It was he who, more than anyone, \n and as soon as it failed \n for lucrative \n.\nBut as Britain finally starts considering the detailed legislation needed to remove us from the European Union, it is becoming clear that Mr. Cameron understood the reasons why so many voters across the West feel alienated from their governments, and he attempted to tackle the root causes, in a way that Ms. May does not.\nIn the decade since the financial crisis, public anger has simmered over the way rich individuals and corporations game the international financial system to avoid paying their fair share. In Britain, those ploys include the tax-minimization schemes of companies like \n and are symbolized by the corrupt officials \xe2\x80\x94 \n, \n, \n \xe2\x80\x94 who launder their stolen cash and besmirched reputations through British institutions, spending their dirty money on \n.\nHundreds of billions of pounds of illicit money pass through British banks every year, and the National Crime Agency \n money laundering \xe2\x80\x9ca strategic threat to the United Kingdom\xe2\x80\x99s economy and reputation.\xe2\x80\x9d Billions more are said to transit through Britain\xe2\x80\x99s overseas territories and dependencies \xe2\x80\x94 the Cayman and British Virgin Islands, Bermuda, Gibraltar, the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man \xe2\x80\x94 all of which make a lucrative living by undercutting onshore economies.\nAll this dirty money is indeed a threat, but its concentration in Britain is also an opportunity. If Britain cleaned itself up, it would deny tax cheats, criminals, kleptocrats and \n access to one of the world\xe2\x80\x99s largest financial centers, and severely restrict their room for maneuver.\nIf democracies don\xe2\x80\x99t rein in the world\xe2\x80\x99s richest citizens and restrain the widening gap between the 0.1 percent and the rest, they will not stay democratic for long. And since today money flows seamlessly through the globalized financial system, stopping it requires international cooperation.\nThis is why the Cameron government put joint efforts against tax avoidance and corruption at the top of the agenda when it chaired \n back in 2013. Even the watered-down final declaration still looks groundbreaking. Information about company ownership should be made available to the authorities (hello, \n and the \n!). Companies should stop \n to minimize their tax bills (\n beware). Poor countries should be helped to obtain the taxes they\xe2\x80\x99re owed (from the trade in \n, say).\nThe hope was that tackling the misuse of the financial system and corruption in developing nations would help solve many of the world\xe2\x80\x99s most pressing problems: poverty, economic stagnation, illegal immigration, even terrorism. \xe2\x80\x9cCorruption adds 10 percent to business costs globally,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Cameron said in a speech in Singapore in July 2015, and \xe2\x80\x9ccutting corruption by just 10 percent could benefit the global economy by $380 billion every year.\xe2\x80\x9d\nEven while the referendum loomed, and Britain\xe2\x80\x99s fate teetered on the thin margins of opinion polls, Mr. Cameron maintained his focus on this global problem. In May last year, the month before the Brexit tsunami capsized his premiership, he hosted an \n in London and won \n from dozens of countries to do more to open up their economies and combat financial crime.\nBut then the Brexit referendum happened, Britain turned inward and all that stopped. The Cameron government had promised to publish its \n by the end of 2016. No strategy has yet emerged. As Jon Benton, who headed the National Crime Agency\xe2\x80\x99s International Corruption Unit and worked in the cabinet office in the months before the summit in May 2016, told me earlier this month: \xe2\x80\x9cWhen Theresa May took over, the anticorruption phone just stopped ringing.\xe2\x80\x9d\nInstead, we had the Conservative Party\xe2\x80\x99s manifesto for the entirely unnecessary election that Ms. May fluffed earlier this year. It does not mention the word \xe2\x80\x9ccorruption\xe2\x80\x9d once, and contains just a few bromides about tax avoidance. It also pledges to strip the Serious Fraud Office of its independence, which is an inexplicable response to that office\xe2\x80\x99s winning \n of the \n against corporate corruption in British history and pushing for more, largely thanks to \n introduced by Mr. Cameron\xe2\x80\x99s government.\nBrexit didn\xe2\x80\x99t just doom the prime minister\xe2\x80\x99s career, it also doomed the campaign he was leading to improve the world.\nThe irony here is that the very problems Mr. Cameron was seeking to cure helped drive the movement that dethroned him. A powerful pro-Brexit poster featured thousands of brown-skinned people queuing to enter the European Union, along with the words \xe2\x80\x9c\n.\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Cameron\xe2\x80\x99s anticorruption campaign was supposed to help improve these immigrants\xe2\x80\x99 home countries so that they could stay put. Instead, anti-immigrant sentiment and public distrust of politicians\xe2\x80\x99 financial integrity won the day. A populist insurgency delivered Brexit, and that is now scuttling efforts to clean up Britain\xe2\x80\x99s tax havens, perhaps indefinitely.\nI never voted for David Cameron, nor did I support him while he was in office. But we shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t let his worst mistake destroy his best initiative.\n'

aS'I was looking forward to having my friend Tamara over for dinner last year, since she had hosted me and my husband many times. But it didn\xe2\x80\x99t turn out as I\xe2\x80\x99d expected. Tamara kept trying to help in various ways, like retrieving items from the kitchen or clearing items from the table. Each time, I told her to please sit down, that I didn\xe2\x80\x99t want her to help. But then she\xe2\x80\x99d be up again.\nAt one point, when she rose from the table and made it into the kitchen, I grabbed her arm and pulled her back. It was done good-naturedly, with humor, but I was genuinely rattled: I felt that she was insisting on being a co-host in my home.\nNormally I would have laid my frustration to the vagaries of human behavior and said nothing. But because Tamara is a good friend \xe2\x80\x94 and because I was writing a book about women\xe2\x80\x99s friendships \xe2\x80\x94 the next time I saw her, I told her how I\xe2\x80\x99d reacted.\nTamara was surprised, but she also recognized her behavior and its source. She told me about a recent dinner at her parents\xe2\x80\x99 home. When the dinner ended, she got up and cleared the table, though her mother told her not to. She washed the dishes, as her mother chastised her, saying, \xe2\x80\x9cStop it!\xe2\x80\x9d Then she cleaned the kitchen, to the tune of her mother\xe2\x80\x99s admonitions that she shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t. And when she was done, her mother said, \xe2\x80\x9cThank you.\xe2\x80\x9d Then she added: \xe2\x80\x9cYou never listen to me. And I\xe2\x80\x99m so glad you don\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\nFrom her mother, Tamara learned that \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t want you to help\xe2\x80\x9d really means \xe2\x80\x9cYou are a guest and shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t help so I appreciate it all the more when you do.\xe2\x80\x9d My mother tended to say pretty much what she meant, so growing up, I had learned to take her and others at their word.\nThough my mother died in 2004, she is the one whose voice comes out when I speak, and whose speaking style shapes how I hear others\xe2\x80\x99 words. The same is true for Tamara, as I learned when our styles clashed.\nTracing our ways of speaking, and listening, to our families\xe2\x80\x99 styles, we both felt as if a light had been turned on. It had never occurred to me that Tamara might think I didn\xe2\x80\x99t mean it when I said I didn\xe2\x80\x99t want her to help. And it had never occurred to her that I did.\nFor the past 40 years, I\xe2\x80\x99ve researched how people speak differently across cultures. And here I was, having missed exactly what I\xe2\x80\x99d written about. The very first paper I published was about the confusion caused when one speaker means words literally and the other thinks they are hinting at something else. And indirectness is a key example I use in cautioning that what is sometimes attributed to psychological, even pathological, motives may simply be differing linguistic styles. Those who expect requests to be expressed directly, for example, may perceive someone being vague as being manipulative, or even passive-aggressive.\nIndeed, one of the most common dynamics I have found among female friends is frustration when one misconstrues what the other meant. For one thing, women tend to talk more, both more often and at greater length, and about more personal topics. In addition, from the time they are little girls playing with other little girls, they learn not to make outright demands, so they avoid the damning label \xe2\x80\x9cbossy.\xe2\x80\x9d And misunderstandings are especially painful among women who treasure the sense that a friend \xe2\x80\x9cgets\xe2\x80\x9d them.\nHow relatively direct or indirect we tend to be often varies by culture. But Tamara and I are both Jewish, and our mothers were both born in Europe \xe2\x80\x94 Tamara\xe2\x80\x99s in Germany, and mine in Russia. I have observed in my research that the relative directness I learned from my mother isn\xe2\x80\x99t so much Jewish as East European, in contrast to the relative indirectness more common among German Jews.\nTracing my style to my mother\xe2\x80\x99s reminded me of other ways that my mother speaks through me. I sometimes intentionally borrow her voice to mock myself. My husband and I always used to make Thanksgiving dinner at my parents\xe2\x80\x99 home in Florida, a precious tradition that I keenly miss.\nMy mother always thought my husband bought and prepared too much food. When we\xe2\x80\x99d return from shopping and empty the bags of groceries in her kitchen, she\xe2\x80\x99d exclaim, \xe2\x80\x9cWho\xe2\x80\x99s going to eat all that!?\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cDid you leave anything on the shelf?!\xe2\x80\x9d\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s handy, now, to echo those exclamations, mimicking and exaggerating her tone of voice and intonation, when I want to tell my husband he\xe2\x80\x99s bought too much but disguise it as a good-humored parody of my mother, and remind us of a time we both cherished.\nIt was deeply satisfying to realize that it was our mothers who were speaking and listening when Tamara came to dinner in my home. I was grateful to be reminded that whenever I open my mouth to speak and my ears to hear, my mother is still with me.\n'

aS'Does free community college work? An experiment in Chicago suggests that the answer is yes.\nTwo years ago, under a program called the Star Scholarship, Chicago began to offer free community college to all public high school graduates who earned a B average or higher and demonstrated near college-level proficiency in their work. To keep costs for students low, they also get their textbooks free.\nSince the program was created by Mayor Rahm Emanuel, roughly 1,000 students a year \xe2\x80\x94 about 5 percent of each Chicago Public Schools graduating class \xe2\x80\x94 have claimed their reward. This fall, more than 2,900 of these students are attending the City Colleges of Chicago, the city\xe2\x80\x99s community college system, which has roughly 90,000 students.\nMost of the Star Scholars are pursuing an associate degree so that they can transfer to a four-year college, but they can also earn certification in various fields along the way and head right into the work force if they choose. Attending either full or part-time, they have up to three years to use the scholarship.\nThe early results of this initiative have been incredibly encouraging. Two-thirds of the 890 Star Scholars who started in the fall of 2015 have either graduated or are currently enrolled with enough credits so that they are on course to complete their degree within three years, the federal benchmark for associate degree completion.\nIn fact, the percentage of students who graduated in two years (22 percent) is nearly the same as the national community college three-year graduation rate and the retention rate of these students after the first year (85 percent) was close to twice the national average for community college students.\nThis success is especially remarkable at the community college level, where the challenge of improving retention and graduation rates is just as pressing as the challenge of enhancing affordability.\nAmong the more than 200 students who have graduated already, more than two-thirds were the first in their families to go to college, more than 90 percent were members of minority groups and more than 60 percent were female.\nTo our knowledge, this is also the only public scholarship in the country open to undocumented immigrants who were brought to the country as children.\nThese are students like Arturo, a son of Mexican immigrants. He attended a large public high school on Chicago\xe2\x80\x99s Northwest Side, where his intellectual curiosity was piqued by computer science classes. Arturo says that without the Star Scholarship he would probably still be in the early stages of his community college career because he would have spent much of his time working a minimum-wage job to afford even the low-tuition cost.\nInstead, Arturo graduated in two years this past May, and was awarded an additional scholarship from the CME Group, which operates financial exchanges. CME also helped arrange a paid summer internship for him at a financial trading firm. Arturo is now a junior at the state\xe2\x80\x99s four-year public university campus in Chicago, studying to become a software engineer.\nA focus on merit has been a guiding principle of the Star program. This helps keep the premise simple: if students work hard, they can go to community college free. And as with Arturo, that opportunity can extend beyond community college.\nMore than half of the first graduating class was accepted at one or more of City Colleges\xe2\x80\x99 20 four-year college partners, all of which have agreed to offer discounted tuition. For students who qualify for the program, this means that they can earn a four-year degree for essentially the cost of a year and a half of college, as long as they study hard from high school through community college.\nDuring the 2016 election campaign, both Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton proposed plans that would free Americans from the enormous cost of college, which have put so many students into debt \xe2\x80\x94 and kept upward mobility out of reach. But no legislation has passed on the national stage, and none is expected.\nIn the laboratories of the cities and the states, though \xe2\x80\x94 in New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Indiana, Montana, Minnesota, Kentucky, Nevada, Washington and Arkansas, as well as Detroit, Pittsburgh, New Haven, Kalamazoo, Mich., Oakland, Calif., and Tulsa, Okla. \xe2\x80\x94 local governments have created or are considering plans to cover tuition for a select number of students or to greatly reduce the cost of college tuition.\nAmong the states, perhaps Tennessee has gone the farthest, offering two years of tuition-free community college for all high school graduates.\nCity Colleges picks up the cost after all other forms of financial aid has been applied. Chicago\xe2\x80\x99s plan funds the scholarship with general operating funds from property taxes. Historically strong reserves have enabled City Colleges to make this commitment, and an endowment is being created as we find more efficient ways of running our programs and sell underutilized assets.\nRecognizing that a high school diploma is no longer sufficient for success, the Star Scholarship program is part of a broader initiative afoot in Chicago to create a seamless \xe2\x80\x9cK to 14\xe2\x80\x9d system. Earlier this year, Mayor Emanuel announced an effort to ensure that all Chicago public high school students graduate with a plan for what they will do after high school, whether it is going to a four-year or two-year college, a job, the military, an internship or something else.\nThe city is also engaging high school students with college-level work as soon as they are ready by offering free college courses. Chicago\xe2\x80\x99s dual enrollment-dual credit program, with high school students taking free college classes, has grown more than tenfold since 2011, serving more than 4,000 students last year. More than 200 high school students graduated last spring with a full semester of college credit this way.\nIt is no coincidence that the vast majority of Star graduates this year were among the cohort of students who earned college credit while still in high school. Students not only save money, they also earn the confidence that they can succeed in college-level courses. A well-earned sense of self-assurance is another reason our retention rates are so high.\nWhat we have seen in Chicago is that when the entire community wraps its arms around students who are willing to work hard, the dream of a college education does not have to be accompanied by the nightmare of a sea of debt.\nAmerica decided in the early 20th century that high school was the baseline of free public education. In the early 21st century, a postsecondary credential is the new requirement for a family-sustaining career. To help our students meet this higher educational bar, we must create educational programs that reflect that new reality.\n'

aS'Last week, Senator Bernie Sanders introduced \xe2\x80\x9cMedicare for all\xe2\x80\x9d legislation, which would enroll all Americans into the nation\xe2\x80\x99s Medicare program within four years. Senator Sanders, the Vermont independent, \n that his proposal would create a system that \xe2\x80\x9cworks not just for millionaires and billionaires, but for all of us.\xe2\x80\x9d\nElizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Kamala Harris of California and over a dozen of their Senate Democratic colleagues have co-sponsored the \n. Representative John Conyers, Democrat of Michigan, and state lawmakers in California have also proposed \xe2\x80\x9csingle payer\xe2\x80\x9d health plans.\nThough we have widely divergent views on health policy \xe2\x80\x94 one of us preferring a German-style system (Dr. Weinberg), the other a more consumer-directed one (Dr. Chen) \xe2\x80\x94 we both believe that single-payer health care, including the proposal advanced by Senator Sanders, is the wrong choice for the country.\nWe recently conducted an analysis of international health systems and concluded that single-payer advocates are substantially overstating the prevalence and success of such systems. While many other countries have universal health systems and feature more government control over individual health care decisions, almost none are actually single-payer. And all of them are wrestling with largely the same challenges Americans are, making different but equally difficult trade-offs on cost, quality and access.\nAs Democrats and other policy makers debate the merits of Senator Sanders\xe2\x80\x99s proposal, here are a few important observations about international systems that they ought to consider.\nFirst, a vanishingly small number of countries actually have single-payer systems. In fact, almost all feature some role for private-sector insurance companies and providers. Britain, which employs providers in its National Health Services, has a parallel private payment system. In countries like Canada \xe2\x80\x94 the system most similar to the one that Mr. Sanders seeks to create \xe2\x80\x94 private corporations provide insurance for services that fall outside of government guarantees. And these guaranteed benefits are substantially more limited than those in the Sanders proposal. Canada, for example, has no national prescription drug benefit but instead a patchwork of provincial systems.\nSome of the highest-rated international systems rely on private health insurers for most health care coverage \xe2\x80\x94 Germany\xe2\x80\x99s, for example, is something like Obamacare exchanges for everyone, but significantly simpler and truly universal. The Netherlands and Switzerland have both moved recently to add more competition and flexibility to systems that were already built on the use of private insurers.\nSecond, single-payer countries have also failed to control rising health care costs. This is important, given that Mr. Sanders\xe2\x80\x99s proposal was released without a cost estimate or financing plan. For historical reasons, many other countries started with lower levels of health care spending than we did. Several \n have shown that this has almost nothing to do with higher administrative costs or corporate profits in the United States and almost everything to do with the higher cost of health care services and the higher salaries of providers here.\nAlthough they started at a lower base \xe2\x80\x94 with, for example, doctors and nurses receiving lower salaries \xe2\x80\x94 countries around the world have all struggled with rising costs. From 1990 to 2012, the United States\xe2\x80\x99 rate of health care cost growth was below that of many countries, including Japan and Britain. In 2015, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development \n that rising health care costs across all countries were unsustainable.\nThird, it is simply untrue that single-payer systems produce a better quality of care across the board. Most health-policy lectures in American universities start with a slide showing that we rank poorly on a broad number of public health measures and outcomes. Yet the United States scores much more highly on different measures, including innovation, patient-centered care and preventive health.\nSpecialty care is better in many categories, although more needs to be done to create broader access to these services. The American health system excels, for example, in cancer care. And while we spend more on it than any other country, we find ourselves at the top of most international rankings in reducing the death rate of patients with preventable cancer deaths, as a product of this spending.\nIn truth, all systems make trade-offs when it comes to allocating health care resources, and they all largely get what they pay for. To the extent that other countries achieve better public health outcomes, they do it primarily through more generous, rather than more efficient, social spending. When you add together health and social spending across countries, the United States is no longer a major outlier when it comes to per capita costs spent on factors that promote health.\nAmerican policy makers can and should look abroad for examples of reforms that work. For example, many other countries have encouraged smarter public and private investments into factors that promote health and wellness, like stable housing and employment opportunities, rather than spending more overall on health care once people are sick.\nBut just as trade-offs must be made to improve health care, so are other countries struggling with balancing the cost and quality of care and universal access. All Americans should bear one important precept in mind: If the Sanders plan sounds too good to be true, it probably is.\n'

aS'A couple of years ago, European researchers began \n, gay and straight, in which one member had been infected with H.I.V. and the other hadn\xe2\x80\x99t. These couples weren\xe2\x80\x99t using condoms. But the infected partner was taking antiretrovirals successfully; the virus was suppressed, undetectable in the blood. The researchers published their results in July 2016 in the Journal of the American Medical Association.\nCan you guess how many times, over the course of more than a year, an infected partner gave an uninfected partner H.I.V.?\nA. 928\nB. 0\nC. 503\nD. 17\nThe answer is B. Zero. And in that fact lies hope.\nHow do you stop AIDS? Not just treating H.I.V., but ending the epidemic. Even when there\xe2\x80\x99s no vaccine and no cure.\nPart of the answer can be witnessed in a white trailer on the grounds of a polyclinic in Hatcliffe, a dusty town in the northern part of greater Harare, Zimbabwe. Even before the trailer opens each day, the benches outside are full of people waiting for a checkup or a fresh supply of medicine for H.I.V. or the diseases that pounce on weakened immune systems.\nHatcliffe\xe2\x80\x99s clinic, like all public clinics in Harare, charges $5 for visits that don\xe2\x80\x99t involve either H.I.V. or tuberculosis. That may seem like a bargain to Americans. But Zimbabwe is in an economic crisis, making millions of people struggle just to buy their staples of cornmeal, sugar and cooking oil.\nThe clinic is supposed to offer medicines free, but has run out of many, said Sheila Chiedza, the nurse who runs it. (A doctor visits on Wednesdays.) The clinic must send patients to a pharmacy to purchase what they need. \xe2\x80\x9cIf we don\xe2\x80\x99t have it here, we are not sure if they can get it,\xe2\x80\x9d Chiedza said.\nFor most Zimbabweans, then, medical care at the public clinic is a financial hardship. But H.I.V. and tuberculosis care are different: Drugs are free, each clinic visit costs just one dollar, and most patients come four times a year.\nWhen I visited in August, the trailer\xe2\x80\x99s back office was crowded with staff members entering data. I asked how well patients did on their AIDS meds. \xe2\x80\x9cNinety percent undetectable,\xe2\x80\x9d said a young man who gave his name as Mr. Edwards.\nThis seemed unbelievably high. In the United States, the figure is about \n.\nBut the clinic may not have been exaggerating. Zimbabwe is one of the world\xe2\x80\x99s worst-governed countries and has suffered a staggering economic decline. But it\xe2\x80\x99s doing right by people with H.I.V. \xe2\x80\x94 a lot better than the United States.\nEvery epidemic has a tipping point. When the transmission rate drops below that point, it begins to recede. For H.I.V., reaching the tipping point requires three things: that 90 percent of people with the virus know they have it, that 90 percent of that group are taking antiretroviral medicines to keep the epidemic in check, and that 90 percent of those taking medicine control the virus to the point where it is undetectable and therefore cannot be transmitted.\nSo having the world at 90-90-90 is the \n by 2020. If you reach 90-90-90, you end up with 73 percent of people with H.I.V. being noncontagious. That 73 percent is the tipping point, at which the epidemic starts to burn out.\nAchieving 73 percent is hard. In the United States, the figure is only 30 percent. A recent survey in which researchers went door to door testing people\xe2\x80\x99s blood found that Zimbabwe is much closer, \n. Between 2003 and 2015, the rate of new infections there declined by two-thirds.\nSurveys have been completed in three other countries. Malawi and Zambia are close to the tipping point. Swaziland, the country with the highest H.I.V. prevalence in the world, has just become the first that we know of to have \n. These results are even more remarkable because across Africa an unusually large group of young people have been reaching the most dangerous age.\nA large part of this success is due to George W. Bush, whose administration established the President\xe2\x80\x99s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, or Pepfar, in 2004. Its impact is now evident in the trailer in the yard of Hatcliffe Polyclinic and just about every such trailer in countries with a large H.I.V. burden.\nOf course, Bush\xe2\x80\x99s initiative wasn\xe2\x80\x99t alone. Pepfar programs are dwarfed by the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Malaria and Tuberculosis, which began working around the world in 2002. Most governments take H.I.V. seriously, and campaigns by a global network of people living with H.I.V. and their supporters achieved those victories.\nPepfar began work in seven African countries in 2004, and also contributed to the Global Fund. Now it works in 22 African countries, along with some in Asia and Latin America.\nIn the past three and a half years, Pepfar has doubled the number of people for whom it provides treatment. It has added a million children in the past two years. On Tuesday, several organizations are releasing household surveys from two more countries \xe2\x80\x94 Lesotho, which is near a tipping point, and Uganda, which has stabilized its epidemic.\n\xe2\x80\x9cZimbabwe has made great strides,\xe2\x80\x9d said Martha Tholanah, a prominent campaigner there for the rights of H.I.V.-infected and gay people. Everyone I spoke with agrees.\nThis is all the more remarkable given the economic catastrophe of the past 10 years (in 2009, the central bank issued a \n that was worth about $30 in U.S. currency) and given Zimbabwe\xe2\x80\x99s repression. Gay male sex is illegal, and Robert Mugabe, Zimbabwe\xe2\x80\x99s dictator, is scorching in his denunciations of homosexuality. \xe2\x80\x9cThere is probably still fear of the health system,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ben Cheng, who researches diagnostic tools for H.I.V. at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and spends a lot of time in Zimbabwe. Gay men there, he says, \xe2\x80\x9care probably not coming in to be tested.\xe2\x80\x9d\nStill, here\xe2\x80\x99s what Zimbabwe has done right:\nIt put its own money into fighting H.I.V. In 1999, the country instituted a 3 percent tax on income and corporate profits to fund AIDS programs. That continues, although the totals collected have suffered in synchrony with a failing economy. But few other poor countries have tried to do as much to pay for fighting the disease.\nSome of the country\xe2\x80\x99s leaders on H.I.V. are serious and competent, including Tsitsi Apollo, who directs the country\xe2\x80\x99s response.\nDeborah Birx, the United States\xe2\x80\x99 global AIDS coordinator and head of Pepfar, said that the biggest global challenge is the first 90 in the 90-90-90 formula: getting people tested so that they know their H.I.V. status. It\xe2\x80\x99s especially difficult to reach young people, so Pepfar focuses on them. \xe2\x80\x9cMore than half of men under 35 and almost a third of women under 25\xe2\x80\x9d who have H.I.V. don\xe2\x80\x99t know they\xe2\x80\x99re infected, Birx said. \xe2\x80\x9cSo they\xe2\x80\x99re unintentionally passing it on.\xe2\x80\x9d\nThese groups are a priority in Zimbabwe as well. The country has a \n to help adolescents stay on treatment, employing H.I.V.-positive teens as front-line workers.\nAnd if men won\xe2\x80\x99t come to the health clinic, the clinic goes to them. Mobile testing and even circumcision teams go in the afternoon and evenings to shopping centers, bars and other place where men congregate. (Male circumcision offers some protection against H.I.V.) \xe2\x80\x9cMen can now get circumcised at night at their favorite watering holes!\xe2\x80\x9d the Hatcliffe Polyclinic \n.\nBut there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot Zimbabwe still must do. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen we sit in committees with the National AIDS Council, it seems that everything is in place,\xe2\x80\x9d Tholanah said. \xe2\x80\x9cBut in the communities, you find out there are such a lot of things communities lack.\xe2\x80\x9d\nShe said that clinics don\xe2\x80\x99t talk to patients about managing the side effects of medicines. Labs frequently lose blood tests, and when the tests do come back, it\xe2\x80\x99s with absurd delays. The results from one of her blood tests, taken in April, arrived in August, she said.\nPerhaps most important, money is so short that needed drugs are not always acquired. One is fluconazole, an important drug that treats thrush and other fungal diseases in AIDS patients. Cheng visited a number of health centers and found that almost none had the drug. \xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99re doing a much better job managing antiretrovirals,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cBut with drugs for opportunistic infections, stock-outs are still a common occurrence.\xe2\x80\x9d\nTholanah said that even some antiretrovirals are now going missing. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen things are O.K., people go every three months,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cBut of late, they\xe2\x80\x99re not O.K.\xe2\x80\x9d She said that for some second-line drugs, clinics are giving out only a week\xe2\x80\x99s supply, and that she had heard of people getting only three days\xe2\x80\x99 worth.\nSo they have to go back to the clinic over and over, which means paying for transportation, paying that dollar and enduring a long wait. Patients have started sharing drugs, she said. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd yesterday I heard that even for first-line drugs, they\xe2\x80\x99re now giving a one-month supply,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s a red flag.\xe2\x80\x9d\nThe budget President Trump submitted to Congress would have thrown this progress \n. He proposed a cut of $2.5 billion to America\xe2\x80\x99s global health budget \xe2\x80\x94 $1 billion less for Pepfar and $225 million less for the Global Fund. Millions of people would have lost their treatment, and the epidemic would have once again picked up steam.\nBoth the House and Senate appropriations committees ignored him, approving funding at the same level as last year\xe2\x80\x99s. When Sen. Patrick Leahy, a Democrat from Vermont, proposed adding $500 million, however, that was voted down, along party lines.\nUntil recently, funding H.I.V. medicines worldwide looked like a noble, necessary \xe2\x80\x94 and never-ending \xe2\x80\x94 project. Now we know that treatment \n prevention. Do it wide and well enough, and AIDS could be defeated. \xe2\x80\x9cThis program started as a humanitarian outreach effort to demonstrate the compassion of the American people,\xe2\x80\x9d Birx said of Pepfar. \xe2\x80\x9cNow it\xe2\x80\x99s translated into a program controlling the epidemic.\xe2\x80\x9d\n'

aS'From the early stages of the Vietnam War, American officials insisted that winning the hearts and minds (yes, the acronym was WHAM) of the South Vietnamese people was the key to victory. But the Americans tasked with carrying out that strategy were ill equipped, linguistically and culturally, to make it work. And in the end, that deficit destroyed whatever good will might have existed on either side and doomed America\xe2\x80\x99s foray into Vietnam to failure.\nBui Diem, South Vietnam\xe2\x80\x99s ambassador to Washington from 1965 to 1972, once called the two countries \xe2\x80\x9cpeoples quite apart.\xe2\x80\x9d And indeed, American and Vietnamese culture had little contact before 1950, when the United States began sending personnel to assist in the fight against Communism. Very few of the Americans sent to South Vietnam had more than a cursory understanding of the country\xe2\x80\x99s language, history, religious traditions, etiquette or politics. The cultural disjunction was exacerbated by a strategic one: While the two nations agreed on the fundamental goal of preserving an independent, non-Communist South Vietnam, the stakes of the war for each were grossly disproportionate. The United States sought merely to uphold its credibility; South Vietnam fought for its existence.\nTheirs was a patron-client relationship. The United States, the world\xe2\x80\x99s strongest country and still riding high off its victory in World War II, was confident in its power \xe2\x80\x94 and its virtue. It expected to lead, and to be followed. In contrast, the South Vietnamese, citizens of a fragile state newly freed from colonial rule and threatened by internal insurgency and external invasion, recognized their desperate need for American help, but they were also acutely sensitive to dominance by an outside power. They struggled to uphold their dignity and autonomy.\nBetween 1950 and 1965, America\xe2\x80\x99s role in the region, while significant in terms of money and mat\xc3\xa9riel, occupied a limited footprint in the lives of everyday Vietnamese. That changed between 1965 and 1967, when the Americanization of the war brought hundreds of thousands of troops and civilians into the country and put an American face on the increasingly widespread destruction wrought by both sides.\nBui Diem noted the absence of communication between the two peoples during the major escalation in 1965, the \xe2\x80\x9cun-self-conscious arrogance\xe2\x80\x9d of the Americans and the impotence of the South Vietnamese. \xe2\x80\x9cThe Americans came in like bulldozers and the South Vietnamese followed their lead without a word of dissent, for the most part without a thought of dissent.\xe2\x80\x9d\nAfter 1965, the United States took on the burden of defeating the enemy militarily. It declined to establish a combined command structure with the South Vietnamese, as it had in Korea. It relegated the Army of the Republic of Vietnam to pacification, a task many Vietnamese considered demeaning. Americanization of the war also produced among South Vietnamese a \xe2\x80\x9ctakeover effect,\xe2\x80\x9d inviting them to stand by and let the Americans fight the Viet Cong and North Vietnamese. Tragically, American actions encouraged dependency in a nation whose independence it sought to sustain.\nAs the American presence swelled, tensions between the two peoples grew. Vietnamese resented the way their visitors looked down on them and imposed their ways on a presumably inferior people. They were annoyed by American impatience. Some envied the opulent lifestyle of the Americans, with their enormous bases equipped with all the conveniences of home, including air conditioning, shopping centers and movie houses. Others protested that the troops acted \xe2\x80\x9cdespicably\xe2\x80\x9d toward them, speeding their trucks and cars through traffic at life-threatening speeds. Some claimed that America dispensed aid as though it were being \xe2\x80\x9cgiven to a beggar.\xe2\x80\x9d\nMost of all, many South Vietnamese resented their dependence on their ally and its suffocating presence in their lives. Some labeled the \xe2\x80\x9cAmerican occupation\xe2\x80\x9d a \xe2\x80\x9cdemoralizing scourge.\xe2\x80\x9d Vietnamese recognized that the Americans were not \xe2\x80\x9ccolonialists,\xe2\x80\x9d the journalist Robert Shaplen observed, but, he perceptively added, \xe2\x80\x9cthere has evolved here a colonial ambience that can sometimes be worse than colonialism itself.\xe2\x80\x9d\nIn the bonanza atmosphere that followed Americanization, South Vietnam\xe2\x80\x99s economy centered upon serving the needs of the new arrivals. Prostitution became a special problem. As the number of Americans in Saigon surged into the tens of thousands, the number of houses of ill repute expanded proportionally, provoking criticism in the United States and South Vietnam. Senator J. William Fulbright of Arkansas fumed that Saigon had become an \xe2\x80\x9cAmerican brothel.\xe2\x80\x9d South Vietnamese Catholics and President Nguyen Van Thieu were especially concerned about prostitution, and pleaded with American officials to do something about the suffocating presence of so many troops.\nThe result was Operation Moose (Move Out of Saigon Expeditiously), implemented mostly during 1967. Thousands of G.I.s moved to base camps outside the city (where the prostitutes soon followed), some joking that they had been \xe2\x80\x9cMoosed.\xe2\x80\x9d Saigon was also declared off limits for R & R. The pace was sufficiently slow that the operation was unofficially tagged Goose (Get Out of Saigon Eventually).\nThe exodus left around 7,900 American soldiers in the city. Moose did not satisfy President Thieu, and it provided no more than a partial solution to the prostitution problem. It also left Saigon more vulnerable to the urban attacks launched by the Viet Cong during the 1968 Tet offensive.\nThe American way of war also inflicted a huge toll on village life in South Vietnam. To limit its own casualties and cope with unfamiliar and often inhospitable terrain, the United States unleashed extraordinary firepower on the country it was trying to save. Areas of suspected enemy strength were bombed and shelled and burned with napalm, often with little consideration of its impact on civilians. Defoliants were used to deny the enemy food and cover, with horrific short- and long-term consequences for Vietnamese.\nAmerican firepower destroyed homes, villages and crops and alienated those whose hearts and minds were to be won. American commanders declared entire areas free-fire zones. Troops would round up villagers, burn their hooches and relocate them from their ancestral lands into squalid refugee camps. The area would then be bombed and shelled. During Operation Cedar Falls in 1967, Americans forcibly relocated some 6,000 civilians from the village of Ben Suc. Caught between the Viet Cong and the Americans, villagers who wanted only to be left alone became sullen or outright hostile. By early 1967, over 1.5 million refugees had drifted into urban slums, where they were susceptible to Viet Cong propaganda.\nTo be sure, many Americans developed close ties with Vietnamese. Many also committed acts of kindness such as providing medical care and food to people in need. Especially in the early years and in remote areas, American advisers formed attachments with Vietnamese soldiers and villagers. Thousands of troops married Vietnamese women.\nStill, most Americans arrived in the country without knowledge of the land and the people. \xe2\x80\x9cMy time in Vietnam is the memory of ignorance,\xe2\x80\x9d one soldier later wrote. Not knowing the language or culture, the Americans did not know what the people felt, or even at times how to tell friend from foe. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat we need is some kind of litmus paper than turns red when it\xe2\x80\x99s near a Communist,\xe2\x80\x9d one officer half-jokingly told a journalist.\nRelations with South Vietnamese soldiers were likewise strained. Unaware of the difficulties their counterparts labored under, American troops disparaged their fighting qualities. The newcomers expected the people they were defending to offer the sort of gratitude they believed their fathers had gained for liberating France in World War II. When instead they encountered indifference or even hostility, they grew resentful.\nFor many Americans, the South Vietnamese became an object of contempt, even hatred. \xe2\x80\x9cThe people were treacherous,\xe2\x80\x9d one soldier later recalled. \xe2\x80\x9cThey say \xe2\x80\x98G.I. No. 1\xe2\x80\x99 when we\xe2\x80\x99re in the village, but at night the dirty little rats are V.C.\xe2\x80\x9d The ability of the villagers to step around mines and booby traps that killed and maimed Americans provoked suspicion of collusion \xe2\x80\x94 and anger.\nAmericans also brought with them deeply entrenched racist attitudes that prompted the use of slurs such as \xe2\x80\x9cgook\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cdink,\xe2\x80\x9d which they applied to enemy and friend alike. Contempt could quickly change to a rage that might be turned on Vietnamese civilians. During the summer and fall of 1967, the notorious Tiger Force, an elite commando unit, was assigned to remove civilians from the Song Ve River Valley, suspected to be a source of rice for Viet Cong units. The very name of the mission, Operation Rawhide, suggested a cattle roundup, which had a dehumanizing effect. When the civilians resisted, the Tigers vented their rage by burning their villages. Unhappy with the assignment and under constant fire from enemy snipers, the Americans declared the area a free-fire zone and shot anything that moved, resulting in the brutal killing of numerous civilians.\nNevertheless, the Tigers were assigned another, similar mission, to remove civilians from Quang Tin province. Early in the operation, they were caught in a deadly ambush and suffered heavy losses. After that, all restraints came off. Commanders abetted their vengeance by setting a body count goal of 327 kills (to match the number of the 327\nInfantry Regiment, of which the Tigers were a part). The Tigers proceeded to kill hundreds of civilians and compounded their crime by mutilating the bodies of victims, including old women and even babies. The carnage stopped only when the operation ended in November.\nThe actions of the Tiger Force were replicated with even more savage results at My Lai, in Quang Ngai province, in February 1968, where American soldiers killed hundreds of Vietnamese civilians. Such atrocities were not typical of American behavior, and even at My Lai there were soldiers who pushed back against their commanders\xe2\x80\x99 orders to kill. Nevertheless, the atrocious violence reflected attitudes toward Vietnamese that divided the two peoples and made the Vietnamese subservient to Americans. Given the frustrations and failures and mounting casualties of the American war effort, atrocities were perhaps only a matter of time.\n'

aS'I was 13 when the black woman I was rooting for on \xe2\x80\x9cAmerican Idol\xe2\x80\x9d won. After black women failed to reach the top spot in the first two seasons, Fantasia finally did. With vocals straight out of a church choir in North Carolina, she deserved it.\nAll the black people I knew \xe2\x80\x94 my mom, classmates and acquaintances \xe2\x80\x94 were so proud. We celebrated this moment together. Fantasia\xe2\x80\x99s victory on one of America\xe2\x80\x99s most watched television shows at the time wasn\xe2\x80\x99t just a win for her: It was a win for \n.\nIssa Rae, a co-creator and the star of the HBO sitcom \xe2\x80\x9cInsecure,\xe2\x80\x9d stood on the Emmys\xe2\x80\x99 red carpet on Sunday and proudly proclaimed to a Variety reporter who asked which people she was cheering for, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m rooting for everybody black.\xe2\x80\x9d When I heard that, I jumped up and shouted: \xe2\x80\x9cSame, Sis! Same!\xe2\x80\x9d Because that\xe2\x80\x99s what I\xe2\x80\x99ve been doing all my life. And apparently many other people have, too, because Variety\xe2\x80\x99s video went viral on Twitter, garnering more than 16,000 retweets and countless reshares up and down my social media timelines.\nMs. Rae told the reporter what so many black people have told their family members at dinner, their friends on group texts and their black co-workers over water cooler talk. As many obstacles as we face in our lives, there are times when we \n to see one another win.\nBut what so many people missed in her comment is that expressing black pride is not the same as being racist toward whites.\n\xe2\x80\x9cTalk about racist! You are one!\xe2\x80\x9d a Twitter user wearing a \xe2\x80\x9cMake America Great Again\xe2\x80\x9d hat wrote.\nMs. Rae\xe2\x80\x99s critics don\xe2\x80\x99t understand that when it comes to racial pride, the playing field is not level. Black pride does not carry the power to shut others out as white pride does. And that\xe2\x80\x99s the difference. Hollywood has a long history of privileging whiteness, from who gets to greenlight movie ideas to whom studios target for consumption. While white people have the luxury of turning on any given channel and seeing themselves reflected with nuance and depth onscreen, black people haven\xe2\x80\x99t been so fortunate.\nSo it\xe2\x80\x99s no surprise that Issa Rae, who is redefining how TV shows portray black millennials, gave her black colleagues props at the Emmys. In fact, it\xe2\x80\x99s the support from black viewers who religiously watched her web series \xe2\x80\x9cAwkward Black Girl\xe2\x80\x9d that helped her become the first black woman to create and star in a scripted series for HBO.\nThough \xe2\x80\x9cInsecure\xe2\x80\x9d wasn\xe2\x80\x99t nominated this year, Ms. Rae was there to unequivocally support others who broke down more of Hollywood\xe2\x80\x99s white-male-dominated doors. And it was genuine: Later that night, she \n her congratulations to Lena Waithe, who became the first black woman to win an Emmy for comedy writing.\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve been killing it for SO long! Get. Yours. Boo! @LenaWaithe #Emmys #BlacksAllZay #SaidWhatISaid,\xe2\x80\x9d she wrote, affirming her initial comment.\nMs. Waithe replied with reciprocal support: \xe2\x80\x9cLove you sis! You got next!! I have a feeling your speech gon be way funnier than mine.\xe2\x80\x9d\nWhen black artists are honored at an esteemed award show like the Emmys, it\xe2\x80\x99s no secret whom we want to win. The fact that black actors, writers and directors in 2017 are still becoming the \xe2\x80\x9cfirst\xe2\x80\x9d black person to ever receive \xe2\x80\x9cX\xe2\x80\x9d award should make that clear.\nBlack pride isn\xe2\x80\x99t designed to block the progress of others. It is meant to empower and create space for black people to celebrate and honor ourselves in a country that tells us in no uncertain terms that black lives do not matter. It\xe2\x80\x99s a necessary escape when racial tension in the world is too much to bear. It\xe2\x80\x99s a tool for survival in a world that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want to see you win.\nWe take enormous joy in seeing Lena Waithe, Donald Glover and Sterling K. Brown walk away with trophies. Their wins give us more hope that our stories will be told in more nuanced, sensitive and multidimensional ways. We will continue to celebrate one another and will always be \xe2\x80\x9crooting for everybody black.\xe2\x80\x9d\n'

aS' Larry and Elida Dimas didn\'t have much to begin with, and Hurricane Irma left them with even less.\nThe storm peeled open the roof of the old mobile home where they live with their 18-year-old twins, and it destroyed another one they rented to migrant workers in Immokalee, one of Florida\'s poorest communities. Someone from the government already has promised aid, but Dimas\' chin quivers at the thought of accepting it.\n"I don\'t want the help," said Dimas, 55. "But I need it."\nDimas is one of millions of Floridians who live in poverty, and an untold number of them have seen their lives up-ended by Irma. Their options, already limited, were narrowed even further when the hurricane destroyed possessions, increased expenses and knocked them out of work.\nNot far from Dimas in impoverished Immokalee, located on the edge of the Everglades, Haitian immigrant Woodchy Darius, a junior at Immokalee High School, must decide whether to return to class when school reopens or head to the fields to pick berries once the land is dry enough to work again.\n"The rent is $375, and if I don\'t have the money they\'ll kick us out," said Darius, 17. He lives in a grubby apartment building with bare concrete floors, burglar-proof doors and cinder-block walls that make it resemble a jail more than home.\nThe Census Bureau estimates about 3.3 million people live in poverty in Florida \xe2\x80\x94 nearly 16 percent of the state\'s 20.6 million population. For them, the amusement parks of Orlando or President Donald Trump\'s Mar-a-Lago Club in Palm Beach might as well be on Mars.\nMany work by the hour in restaurants, gas stations, hotels, stores and other businesses forced to close for days after Irma, depriving them of paychecks. Others are day laborers or migrants who earn money by the pound picking produce that\'s sold in stores nationwide. Still others are retirees on fixed incomes or disability checks whose budgets already were tight before Irma.\nFleeing Irma wasn\'t an option for those who lacked transportation to get to a shelter, couldn\'t afford gas to drive north and couldn\'t rent a hotel room. The likely costs associated with cleaning up or finding a new place to live pushed them closer to the edge than ever.\nAfter Irma, Gwen Bush scrambled to find a place just to sleep after flood waters rose around her home.\nA security worker for Amway Center in Orlando, Bush hadn\'t worked in the days leading up to Irma because concerts and other events had been canceled as the storm approached. It\'s not certain when the arena will be open for business, and she was down to her final $10 before the storm.\n"I\'ve been through some hurricanes and some storms living here but I can say on my life this is the worst I\'ve ever seen," said Bush, 50, a lifelong resident of Orlando. "How do you recover from this, losing all of your stuff?"\nDavid and Andrea Jewell survive on disability checks and live on a sailboat they bought for $1,000 on eBay years ago. David Jewell, 51, can\'t imagine now living on land; both consider the ocean \xe2\x80\x94 like the dolphins they watch \xe2\x80\x94 their only real neighbors.\nAfter the storm, the Jewells stayed on cots in the gym at a community center in Jacksonville. They tried to figure out if they could get a new boat if theirs was destroyed. Maybe, they decided, they could just cut back on food and find another cheap one with their next disability checks.\n"There aren\'t any answers," he said, "so I guess I\'ll have to roll with it."\nBut in one bit of good news, they later learned from a friend that their boat is still floating.\nFor some poor people, there\'s at least a little upside to the devastation.\nGuatemalan immigrant Aura Gaspar totaled up storm-related expenses of about $600 while using a twig-fired grill to stew chicken on her front stoop in Immokalee; she has three school-age children to feed and a 2-week-old baby.\nBut Gaspar said husband Juan Francisco got a job cleaning up storm debris in the Fort Myers and Naples area. He needed to get busy, she said through a translator: Their storm preparations cost nearly twice as much as his weekly pay of $320.\n"We had to prepare the house so it would protect us," said Gaspar, 28.\nBeside his ruined Immokalee mobile home, Dimas is trying to get back on his feet, but it\'s tough.\nDimas earns a meager living cooking hamburgers and chicken in a food truck parked by his home, and some customers already have returned \xe2\x80\x94 he said he sold all 40 of the hamburgers that were still safe to cook Tuesday.\nDimas needs to replace the income from his rental trailer, already condemned after being split open by the wind. Dimas had used that money to help feed his two teenagers and pay for the rescue inhalers he needs for his asthma. Losing it will only make it harder for Dimas to do what he says is one of his favorite things \xe2\x80\x94 providing free or cut-rate food to those who have even less.\nCoping with Irma\'s aftermath is only making life tougher for people with little who live in places including unincorporated Immokalee, said Dimas.\n"A lot of people work. They work hard here. They don\'t ask for nothing. They just go to work, come home and something like this happens, it\'s ....," Dimas said. "I don\'t know what to say."\nHe stopped talking and turned away to keep from crying.\n'

aS' President Donald Trump is going to hear firsthand from people affected by Hurricane Irma as he makes his third visit in less than three weeks to survey storm damage and recovery efforts.\nFor Trump and Vice President Mike Pence, the visit Thursday to Naples and Fort Myers on Florida\'s southwestern coast offered the chance to see how people were coping and how the Federal Emergency Management Agency has responded.\n"Historically there\'s never been anything like this," Trump told reporters before leaving the White House. "But the United States Coast Guard, FEMA, working along with Gov. (Rick) Scott, they\'ve really done an amazing job," adding that "power is being turned on rapidly," he said.\nAfter Harvey struck Texas, Trump drew criticism for having minimal interaction with residents during his first trip in late August. He saw little damage and offered few expressions of concern.\nOn his second visit, to Texas and Louisiana, he was more hands-on. He toured a Houston shelter housing hundreds of displaced people and walking streets lined with soggy, discarded possessions.\nThe president monitored Irma over this past weekend from Camp David, the presidential retreat in Maryland.\nNearly half of Florida was engulfed by Irma, which left flooded streets, damaged homes and displaced residents in its wake. The Keys felt Irma\'s full fury when the hurricane roared in after wreaking devastation in the Caribbean, but the extent of the damage has been an unanswered question because some places have been unreachable.\nFlorida\'s southwestern coast is a haven for retirees seeking warm weather and beautiful sunsets across the Gulf of Mexico. Many communities there are still cleaning up or without power or air conditioning.\nAs of Thursday morning, the number of homes and businesses without electricity in Florida was 2.69 million, according to the state\'s Division of Emergency Management. That\'s 25.6 percent of all customers in the state.\n__\nAssociated Press writer Ken Thomas contributed to this report.\n'

aS' Nearly three weeks into a mass exodus of Rohingya Muslims fleeing violence in Myanmar, thousands were still flooding across the border Thursday in search of help and safety in teeming refugee settlements in Bangladesh.\nThe crisis has drawn global condemnation, with U.N. officials demanding Myanmar halt what they described as a campaign of ethnic cleansing that has driven some 400,000 Rohingya to flee Rakhine state.\nOne of the dozens of boats carrying Rohingya to the Bangladeshi border town of Teknaf capsized Thursday and at least two people drowned, police said. That brought known drownings in the Naf River to 88 since the crisis began.\nThose who arrived Wednesday in wooden boats on beaches near Shah Porir Dwip fishing village described ongoing violence in Buddhist-majority Myanmar, where smoke could be seen billowing from a burning village \xe2\x80\x94 suggesting more Rohingya homes had been set alight.\nOne Rohingya man said his village of Rashidong had been attacked six days earlier by Myanmar soldiers and police.\n"When military and police surrounded our village and attacked us with rocket launchers to set fire, we got away from our village and fled away to any direction we could manage," Abdul Goffar said.\nMyanmar presidential office spokesman Zaw Htay said that out of 471 "Bengali" villages in three Rakhine townships, 176 were now completely empty while at least 34 more were partially abandoned. Many in Myanmar use that term as part of the long-standing refusal to accept Rohingya as citizens of the country.\nMyanmar has accused the Rohingya of burning their own homes and villages \xe2\x80\x94 a claim the U.N. human rights chief criticized as a "complete denial of reality."\nThe crisis and refugee exodus began on Aug. 25, when Rohingya insurgents attacked police posts. Myanmar\'s military retaliated with "clearance operations" to root out the rebels, but the fleeing Rohingya say Myanmar soldiers shot indiscriminately, burned their homes and warned them to leave or die. Others have said they were attacked by Buddhist mobs. Hundreds have died, mostly Rohingya, and some of the refugees have needed treatment for bullet wounds.\nFacing growing condemnation globally, Myanmar leader Aung San Suu Kyi will not attend U.N. General Assembly meetings Sept. 19-25 to instead deal with what the government said were domestic security issues.\nU.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres told reporters Wednesday that ethnic cleansing was taking place against Rohingya in Rakhine state. The term "ethnic cleansing" is defined as an effort to rid an area of an unwanted ethnic group \xe2\x80\x94 by displacement, deportation or even killing.\nThe U.N. Security Council called for "immediate steps to end the violence" and ensure civilian protections. Rohingya have faced decades of persecution in Myanmar, and are denied citizenship despite centuries-old roots in the Rakhine region.\nThe thousands of Rohingya flooding into Bangladesh every day have arrived hungry and traumatized. Many need urgent medical care for violence-related injuries, severe infections or childbirth.\n"The women who are coming for check-ups all have a terrified and exhausted look," said Sumaya, a midwife at the Nayapara refugee camp working in association with the U.N. population fund. "We keep hearing stories from them of walking through jungles and across hills for days without food, their children carried over their shoulders. They\'ve lost their homes."\nTwo existing refugee camps were packed beyond capacity, and Bangladesh has said it would free land to build a third. Many of the new arrivals were huddling in makeshift shelters along roads or in open fields. Near the camp of Balukhali, some were setting up tents made of bamboo and plastic along hillsides muddy from days of rain. Children walked uphill to capture rainwater before it spilled into the teeming settlements below.\nFood, clean water and other necessities were scarce.\nPanic erupted Thursday along roadsides where local volunteers were distributing food, water and other supplies haphazardly from parked vehicles. Local officials shouted through bullhorns for volunteers to coordinate their efforts with aid agencies to avoid spreading chaos.\n"There are acute shortages of everything, most critically shelter, food and clean water," UNICEF country representative Edouard Beigbeder said.\nThe U.N. children\'s agency said it needed $7.3 million to help just the hundreds of thousands of Rohingya children now at high risk of contracting water-borne diseases.\nOn Thursday afternoon, a scuffle broke out at a makeshift relief center at Kutupalong, where some refugees tried to break into the center and were beaten back by at least four security guards wielding sticks.\nThose who managed to receive some aid after waiting hours in line were dismayed by the meager hand-out.\n"I have just got a tarpaulin sheet but no food," said 55-year-old Osman, who gave only one name. "I need rice to eat, I need to feed my family. They said they can\'t give us anything else. What will I eat now?"\nThe head of the U.N. High Commission for Refugees said humanitarian assistance would increase "very, very quickly." Asked why the response has been slow, Filippo Grandi alluded to difficulties working in Bangladesh, but said he hoped this will change as the scale of the crisis becomes more apparent.\nIt is the Myanmar government\'s "responsibility to ensure that security returns to Rakhine," Grandi told The Associated Press at the Stockholm Security Conference in Sweden.\nBangladesh already was housing some 500,000 Rohingya who fled earlier flashes of violence including anti-Muslim riots in 2012. Rakhine state had up to 1 million Rohingya before the latest violence.\n'

aS'\xe2\x80\x9cThere is a deep well of rage inside of me. Rage about how I as an individual have been treated in philosophy; rage about how others I know have been treated; and rage about the conditions that I\xe2\x80\x99m sure affect many women and minorities in philosophy, and have caused many others to leave.\xe2\x80\x9d Those words, \n, a distinguished professor of philosophy at M.I.T., well express the moral energy behind the feminist ferment currently shaking American philosophy.\nThis ferment has overturned the male dominance of our primary professional organization, the American Philosophical Association, with women (who make up about one-fourth of the members) holding over half of the seats on its governing board. This change correlates with the recent vigorous efforts of the A.P.A. to increase the proportion of women (and minorities) in philosophy and to root out all forms of bias and discrimination. The organization\xe2\x80\x99s website lists a dozen projects and resources devoted to diversity, and its Committee on the Status of Women has established a site-visit program open to any department that wants advice on improving its climate for women.\nThis organizational shift, combined with supportive actions from many major philosophy departments, has decisively furthered philosophical feminism as a political cause. The discipline now seems committed in principle to gender equality, despite considerable disagreement about just what that means and how best to achieve it. We can still expect many intense and even rancorous disputes over these questions. Here, however, I want to put aside these unavoidable disputes and reflect on the importance of feminist philosophy for the future of philosophical thinking.\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s easy to conclude that feminist philosophy is little more than the vehicle of a political movement. The editors of the recent \xe2\x80\x9cRoutledge Companion to Feminist Philosophy\xe2\x80\x9d note that feminist philosophy \xe2\x80\x9coriginated in feminist politics\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cincluded from the start discussion of feminist political issues and positions.\xe2\x80\x9d\nNowadays, major feminist philosophers often define their work in explicitly political terms. Elizabeth Anderson, for example, says that feminist epistemology and philosophy of science \xe2\x80\x9cidentifies ways in which dominant conceptions and practices of knowledge attribution, acquisition, and justification systematically disadvantage women and other subordinated groups, and strives to reform these conceptions and practices so that they serve the interests of these groups.\xe2\x80\x9d And Sally Haslanger, in her seminal analysis of gender and race, says, \xe2\x80\x9cAt the most general level, the task is to develop accounts of gender and race that will be effective tools in the fight against injustice.\xe2\x80\x9d She goes on to offer the following definition of \xe2\x80\x9cwoman\xe2\x80\x9d: \xe2\x80\x9cS is a woman [if and only if] S is systematically subordinated along some dimension \xe2\x80\x94 economic, political, legal, social \xe2\x80\x94 and S is \xe2\x80\x98marked\xe2\x80\x99 as a target for this treatment by observed or imagined bodily features presumed to be evidence of a female\xe2\x80\x99s biological role in reproduction.\xe2\x80\x9d\nPhilosophers uneasy with strong feminist claims about the current poor treatment of women \xe2\x80\x94 or who just think it\xe2\x80\x99s wrong to presuppose such claims in philosophical discussions \xe2\x80\x94 may feel that feminist philosophy has nothing to offer them. Even sympathetic male philosophers may see such philosophy as the province of women, particularly since most writing on feminist topics is by women and feminists sometimes seem not to welcome male contributions. (The 56 essays in the \xe2\x80\x9cRoutledge Companion\xe2\x80\x9d are all by women.)\nIn fact, however, feminist philosophy should be an essential resource for all philosophers, whatever their views about its political agenda. To see why, it will help to reflect on an earlier disruption to the philosophical establishment: the \xe2\x80\x9cpluralist revolt\xe2\x80\x9d against the dominant analytic philosophy of the 1970s and \xe2\x80\x9980s. The pluralists were a disparate group of philosophers: pragmatists in the tradition of Peirce, James and Dewey; metaphysicians following classical thinkers such as Aristotle and Aquinas or the process philosophy of Whitehead; and, most prominently, \xe2\x80\x9ccontinental philosophers\xe2\x80\x9d working out of recent European movements such as phenomenology (Husserl, Heidegger, Sartre); post-structuralism (Foucault, Derrida); and critical theory (Habermas and the Frankfurt School).\nPluralists challenged the dominance of the A.P.A. by the analytic philosophy that they saw as modeling itself on mathematics and natural science. This mode of thought, they said, imposed standards of conceptual clarity and logical rigor that restricted philosophical thinking to a narrow range of abstract and artificial questions. These restrictions, they argued, marginalized pluralist philosophers and, more important, excluded the great perennial questions that had defined philosophy from Plato to Hegel.\nThe pluralists gained a good deal of power within the A.P.A., made room for alternative voices and no doubt played a role in the broadening of analytic interests. Their efforts supported an increased interest in traditional questions, particularly in metaphysics and ethics, and a turn to pragmatic positions in epistemology. But the pluralists did not overcome the analytic hegemony, with analytic philosophers remaining a large majority in the most highly regarded departments.\nFurther, the pluralists did little to blunt the sharp division between analytic philosophy and so-called continental philosophy, which maintained its own (relatively marginalized) departments, national organization and journals. Indeed, we are now seeing a good deal of work on \xe2\x80\x9ccontinental\xe2\x80\x9d philosophers move from philosophy to other humanistic disciplines (for example, in language, communication and film studies departments) and to the softer social sciences.\nToday, feminist philosophy has produced an awakening far beyond that of the pluralist revolt. It has already further broadened and deepened analytic philosophy and shows promise of promoting serious engagement with continental thinkers.\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s interesting that the new feminist directions sometimes derive from the stereotypical roles that society has imposed on women. In ethics, as Rosemarie Tong and Nancy Williams note in their Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy article on feminist ethics, \xe2\x80\x9cproponents of feminist care ethics \xe2\x80\xa6 stress that traditional moral theories \xe2\x80\xa6 are deficient to the degree they lack, ignore, trivialize, or demean values and virtues culturally associated with women.\xe2\x80\x9d\nSo, for example, societies have often directed women toward subordinating their interests to others (husbands or children, for example). As a result, women tend to be particularly sensitive to \xe2\x80\x9ccare\xe2\x80\x9d as an ethical value, and feminist philosophers (like Nel Nodding and Virginia Held) have developed various \xe2\x80\x9cethics of care\xe2\x80\x9d that supplement or displace \xe2\x80\x9cmasculine\xe2\x80\x9d ethical values such as autonomy and self-fulfillment. Even an other-directed principle such as \xe2\x80\x9cAct for the greatest happiness of all\xe2\x80\x9d takes on a deeper meaning when understood not as a duty toward generic humanity but as a call to personal engagement with those in need.\nIn a different vein, women live in a society that presents as \xe2\x80\x9cnatural\xe2\x80\x9d what they experience as arbitrary constraints. This can provide them with a particular sensitivity to injustices that are due less to individual ill will than to the structures of established practices and institutions. Feminist social philosophers like Nancy Fraser have developed this line of thought in dialogue with the work of Marx, Foucault, Habermas and other continental thinkers.\nFeminist epistemologists have developed the notion of situated knowledge to counter standard analytic approaches that treat knowledge as the goal of an isolated mind (\xc3\xa0 la Descartes), abstracted from concrete life situations such as the knower\xe2\x80\x99s body, emotions, values and social roles. Continental traditions like Marxism and existential phenomenology have long emphasized such situated knowledge. But feminist philosophers like Louise Antony and Helen Longino have offered strong analytic arguments for enriching the \xe2\x80\x9cmasculinist\xe2\x80\x9d view of knowledge with elements previously ignored, perhaps as signs of \xe2\x80\x9cfeminine\xe2\x80\x9d cognitive weakness.\nSimilarly, feminist metaphysicians have argued that metaphysical distinctions between superior and inferior categories (mind/matter, essential/contingent, self/other) were often used to express male superiority. This has led to the suggestion that such dichotomies did not express eternal necessities but rather historically constructed social categories \xe2\x80\x94 a suggestion feminists found supported by the work of continental philosophers like Simone de Beauvoir and Michel Foucault.\nFeminists\xe2\x80\x99 personal and political rage against injustice (and parallel emotional reactions against their claims) could, of course, create an atmosphere inimical to fruitful philosophical reflection. But looking at the significant achievements of feminist philosophers, feminism promises to improve not only the climate for women but also philosophical thinking itself.\n'

aS'Plastic bags are often used for a few minutes before enjoying an eternal afterlife, clogging storm drains, stuffing landfills, killing animals that eat them and contributing to the \n of plastic that end up in the world\xe2\x80\x99s oceans every year.\nLast month, Kenya took strong action to tackle the scourge.

aS' Republican U.S. President Donald Trump said on Thursday any agreement on protections for illegal immigrants brought to the United States as children must be tied to border security and  disputed Democratic congressional leaders who said they had reached a deal on the issue. \n\xe2\x80\x9cNo deal was made last night on DACA. Massive border security would have to be agreed to in exchange for consent. Would be subject to vote,\xe2\x80\x9d Trump wrote in one of a series of posts on Twitter, adding that \xe2\x80\x9cthe Wall... will continue to be built.\xe2\x80\x9d \nThe president was referring to the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program created by former President Barack Obama. Trump said last week he would end it in six months and called on the U.S. Congress to act. He later said he might \xe2\x80\x9crevisit\xe2\x80\x9d the issue if lawmakers do not. \nSenate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer and House of Representatives minority leader Nancy Pelosi had said they came to an agreement with Trump at a dinner meeting at the White House Wednesday evening. \nThe two said in a statement Wednesday night they agreed to quickly enact protections for immigrant children dubbed Dreamers along with a border security package that did not fund the wall.  \nPelosi later said in a letter to House Democrats that she and Schumer \xe2\x80\x9cinsisted that the bipartisan DREAM Act would be the basis for that protection and that we would review border security measures that didn\xe2\x80\x99t include building a wall.\xe2\x80\x9d  \n\xe2\x80\x9cHopefully, we can get this all done in a matter of weeks,\xe2\x80\x9d she added.     \nThe White House also disputed any deal regarding the border wall, a central promise of Trump\xe2\x80\x99s 2016 presidential campaign. \n\xe2\x80\x9cWhile DACA and border security were both discussed, excluding the wall was certainly not agreed to,\xe2\x80\x9d White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said on Twitter on Wednesday night. \nStill, Trump on Thursday appeared to acknowledge the complexity of the issue of such immigrant children, many of whom are now young adults. A Reuters poll this week showed 72 percent of nearly 1,700 people surveyed backed legal protection, not deportation.  \n\xe2\x80\x9cDoes anybody really want to throw out good, educated and accomplished young people who have jobs, some serving in the military?\xe2\x80\x9d Trump asked in another tweet.  \nTrump has repeatedly promised to build a wall along the southern U.S. border aimed at keeping out immigrants and drugs. He said Mexico would pay for it but he has since requested money from Congress, despite having little support even among Republican lawmakers. \nThe dispute over characterizing the dinner could cloud Trump\xe2\x80\x99s latest effort to reach out to opposition party Democrats on major legislation. He has yet to see major legislation pass despite Republican control of the White House and Congress. \nIn addition to Wednesday night\xe2\x80\x99s dinner, Trump in recent days has also met with bipartisan groups of U.S. lawmakers, and last week reached a surprise deal with Schumer and Pelosi to fund the government through mid-December. \n'

aS" A North Korean state agency threatened on Thursday to use nuclear weapons to \xe2\x80\x9csink\xe2\x80\x9d Japan and reduce the United States to \xe2\x80\x9cashes and darkness\xe2\x80\x9d for supporting a U.N. Security Council resolution and sanctions over its latest nuclear test. \nThe Korea Asia-Pacific Peace Committee, which handles the North\xe2\x80\x99s external ties and propaganda, also called for the breakup of the Security Council, which it called \xe2\x80\x9ca tool of evil\xe2\x80\x9d made up of \xe2\x80\x9cmoney-bribed\xe2\x80\x9d countries that move at the order of the United States. \n\xe2\x80\x9cThe four islands of the archipelago should be sunken into the sea by the nuclear bomb of Juche. Japan is no longer needed to exist near us,\xe2\x80\x9d the committee said in a statement carried by the North\xe2\x80\x99s official KCNA news agency.   \nJuche is the North\xe2\x80\x99s ruling ideology that mixes Marxism and an extreme form of go-it-alone nationalism preached by state founder Kim Il Sung, the grandfather of the current leader, Kim Jong Un. \nRegional tension has risen markedly since the reclusive North conducted its sixth, and by far its most powerful, nuclear test on Sept. 3, following a series of missile tests, including one that flew over Japan. \nThe 15-member Security Council voted unanimously on a U.S.-drafted resolution and a new round of sanctions on Monday in response, banning North Korea\xe2\x80\x99s textile exports that are the second largest only to coal and mineral, and capping fuel supplies. \nThe North reacted to the latest action by the Security Council, which had the backing of veto-holding China and Russia, by reiterating threats to destroy the United States, Japan and South Korea. \n\xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s reduce the U.S. mainland into ashes and darkness. Let\xe2\x80\x99s vent our spite with mobilization of all retaliation means which have been prepared till now,\xe2\x80\x9d the statement said. \nJapan\xe2\x80\x99s Nikkei stock index and dollar/yen currency pared gains, although traders said that was more because of several Chinese economic indicators released on Thursday rather than a reaction to the North\xe2\x80\x99s latest statement. \nSouth Korea\xe2\x80\x99s won also edged down around the same time over domestic financial concerns. \nDespite the North\xe2\x80\x99s threats, South Korean President Moon Jae-in said he was against having nuclear weapons in his country, either by developing its own arsenal or bringing back U.S. tactical nuclear weapons that were withdrawn in the early 1990s. \n\xe2\x80\x9cTo respond to North Korea by having our own nuclear weapons will not maintain peace on the Korean peninsula and could lead to a nuclear arms race in northeast Asia,\xe2\x80\x9d Moon said in an interview with CNN. \nSouth Korea\xe2\x80\x99s Unification Ministry also said it planned to provide $8 million through the U.N. World Food Programme and UNICEF to help infants and pregnant women in the North. \nThe move marks Seoul\xe2\x80\x99s first humanitarian assistance for the North since its fourth nuclear test in January 2016 and is based on a longstanding policy of separating humanitarian aid from politics, the ministry said. \n\xe2\x80\x9cDANCING TO THE TUNE\xe2\x80\x9d \nThe North\xe2\x80\x99s latest threats also singled out Japan for \xe2\x80\x9cdancing to the tune\xe2\x80\x9d of the United States, saying it should never be pardoned for not offering a sincere apology for its \xe2\x80\x9cnever-to-be-condoned crimes against our people\xe2\x80\x9d, an apparent reference to Japan\xe2\x80\x99s wartime aggression. \nIt also referred to South Korea as \xe2\x80\x9ctraitors and dogs\xe2\x80\x9d of the United States. \nJapan criticized the North\xe2\x80\x99s statement harshly. \n\xe2\x80\x9cThis announcement is extremely provocative and egregious. It is something that markedly heightens regional tension and is absolutely unacceptable,\xe2\x80\x9d Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga told reporters. \nJapanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, visiting India, called for strict enforcement of the U.N. resolution, saying the world must force a change. \nThe 15-member Security Council voted unanimously on a U.S.-drafted resolution and a new round of sanctions against North Korea on Monday in response to its latest and most powerful test, banning North Korea\xe2\x80\x99s textile exports that are the second largest only to coal and mineral, and capping fuel supplies. \nNorth Korea had already rejected the Security Council resolution, vowing to press ahead with its nuclear and missile programs. \nA tougher initial U.S. draft of Monday\xe2\x80\x99s resolution was weakened to win the support of China, the North\xe2\x80\x99s lone major ally, and Russia. Significantly, it stopped short of imposing a full embargo on oil exports to North Korea, most of which come from China. \nThe latest sanctions also make it illegal for foreign firms to form commercial joint ventures with North Korean entities. \nU.S. President Donald Trump has vowed that North Korea will never be allowed to threaten the United States with a nuclear-tipped missile, but has also asked China to do more to rein in its neighbor. China in turn favors an international response to the problem. \nChinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said the international community had reached a \xe2\x80\x9chigh consensus\xe2\x80\x9d on trying to realize a peaceful solution. \n\xe2\x80\x9cWe urge the relevant directly involved parties to seize the opportunity and have the political nerve to make the correct political choice as soon as possible,\xe2\x80\x9d Hua told a regular press briefing. \nThe North accuses the United States, which has 28,500 troops in South Korea, of planning to invade and regularly threatens to destroy it and its Asian allies. \nThe United States and South Korea are technically still at war with North Korea because the 1950-53 Korean conflict ended with a truce and not a peace treaty. \n(For a graphic on North Korea's missile and nuclear tests, click: \n) \n"

aS' U.S. President Donald Trump visits hurricane-ravaged Florida on Thursday where police are probing the deaths of eight patients inside a nursing home as Hurricane Irma left millions in the state without power. \nPolice in Hollywood, north of Miami, opened a criminal investigation on Wednesday after finding three dead patients at the Rehabilitation Center at Hollywood Hill, a facility that had been operating with little or no air conditioning.  \nFour more patients died at or en route to hospital and a fifth was later identified as having died the night before, officials said. \nThe death toll from Irma stood at 81, with several hard-hit Caribbean islands accounting for more than half the fatalities, and officials continued to assess damage inflicted by the second major hurricane to strike the U.S. mainland this year. \nTrump will visit Fort Myers in southwest Florida, an area hard hit by the storm, for a briefing on Hurricane Irma. He will then travel south to Naples, Florida to meet with residents tackling the aftermath of storm, the White House said in a statement.  \n\xe2\x80\x9cThe devastation left by Hurricane Irma was far greater, at least in certain locations, than anyone thought - but amazing people working hard!\xe2\x80\x9d the president said in a Tweet on Tuesday.  \nOne of the most powerful Atlantic storms on record, Irma bore down on the Caribbean with devastating force as it raked the northern shore of Cuba last week. \nIt barreled into the Florida Keys island chain on Sunday, packing sustained winds of up to 130 miles per hour (215 km per hour) before plowing up the Gulf Coast of the state and dissipating. \nIn addition to severe flooding across Florida and extensive property damage in the Keys, residents faced widespread power outages that initially plunged more than half the state into darkness. \nSome 4.3 million homes and businesses were still without power on Wednesday in Florida and neighboring states. \nAbout 150 of the Florida\xe2\x80\x99s nearly 700 nursing facilities were without electricity as of Wednesday morning, according to the Florida Health Care Association, which represents most of them.  \nFlorida Power & Light provided electricity to parts of the nursing home in Hollywood but the facility was not on a county priority list for emergency power restoration, the utility said. \nTotal insured losses from the storm are expected to run about $25 billion, including $18 billion in the United States and $7 billion in the Caribbean, catastrophe modeler Karen Clark & Company estimated on Wednesday. \nThe Florida Keys were particularly hard hit, with federal officials saying 90 percent of its homes were destroyed or heavily damaged. The remote island chain stretches nearly 100 miles (160 km) into the Gulf of Mexico from Florida\xe2\x80\x99s southern tip, connected by a single highway and series of bridges. \nOn Key West, at the end of the archipelago, hundreds of residents who had refused evacuation orders lined up on Wednesday outside the island\xe2\x80\x99s Salvation Army outpost for water and military-style rations after enduring days of intense heat with little water, power or contact with the outside world. \nThe stench of dead fish and decaying seaweed permeated the air. \nIrma wreaked utter devastation on several of the northern Leeward Islands of the Caribbean, where at least 43 people died. Irma hit Florida about two weeks after Hurricane Harvey plowed into Houston, killing about 60 and causing some $180 billion in damage, mostly from flooding. \n'

aS'01 MISSILE ALERT FACILITY (Reuters) - About 70 feet (21 m) below ground, in a shielded military capsule that can launch nuclear missiles, 23-year-old 2nd Lieutenant Tia Hewuse is concerned that Americans have the mistaken impression that her mission is a gloomy one. \n\xe2\x80\x9cAmerica doesn\xe2\x80\x99t understand what we do,\xe2\x80\x9d says Hewuse, whose post sits below a tiny U.S. base surrounded by vast expanses of windswept North Dakota farmland.    \n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is what keeps our enemies at bay,\xe2\x80\x9d she says with a smile. \nHewuse is one of the U.S. Air Force missileers who met Defense Secretary Jim Mattis on Wednesday as he oversees a Pentagon review of America\xe2\x80\x99s aging nuclear arsenal. Experts say it could cost a trillion dollars or more to modernize it. \nCritics of the intercontinental ballistic missiles have argued that the silos scattered across thousands of square miles of the upper Great Plains are sitting ducks in a war and that, given the costs of modernizing ICBMs, the United States should spend its money on weaponry that could better survive a first strike by an enemy. \nMattis himself questioned in 2015 whether the three legs of America\xe2\x80\x99s nuclear \xe2\x80\x9ctriad\xe2\x80\x9d of ballistic missile submarines, bombers and land-based missiles should perhaps be reduced to a \xe2\x80\x9cdyad.\xe2\x80\x9d  \nBut in the latest sign that places like Hewuse\xe2\x80\x99s Cold War-era missile alert facility will be around for years to come, Mattis said on Wednesday he believed all three portions of the triad were vital. \n\xe2\x80\x9cI have been persuaded that the triad, in its framework, is the right way to go,\xe2\x80\x9d Mattis told reporters traveling with him to Minot Air Force Base, where he got a firsthand look at U.S.  land-based nuclear missile facilities and nuclear-capable bombers. \nMattis declined to set a deadline for the review, which is expected to take months to complete. \nMattis\xe2\x80\x99 tour of America\xe2\x80\x99s doomsday weaponry comes as President Donald Trump uses bellicose rhetoric about the \xe2\x80\x9cfire and fury\xe2\x80\x9d that could await North Korea, should it choose to attack the United States. \nNorth Korea has responded with similarly bellicose warnings after it staged its sixth and largest nuclear test this month. In July, Pyongyang tested an ICBM that experts believe was capable of reaching most of the United States.  \nU.S. officials have also noted that America\xe2\x80\x99s nuclear modernization is lagging behind Russia\xe2\x80\x99s upgrade of its own nuclear triad.  \nGeneral Paul Selva, vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told Congress in August he believed Moscow was already two-thirds through its nuclear modernization process. \nThe Arms Control Association estimates that the total cost of upgrading the U.S. nuclear forces will be between $1.25 trillion and $1.46 trillion over the next 30 years.  \nMattis, without offering a figure, suggested that nuclear deterrence was worth the investment.  \n\xe2\x80\x9cAmerica can afford survival,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.   \nMattis says his goal would be to ensure that an adversary concludes that there is no viable prospect for successfully attacking the United States and surviving.  \n\xe2\x80\x9cWe want the enemy to look at it and say this is impossible,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.  \nThe land-based, nuclear-capable missiles are a big part of that. \nThe U.S. forces who staff these facilities near the U.S. border with Canada have to endure bitter cold in the winters, which can get so bad that missileers can be stuck in their posts for up to 72 hours, officials said. \nOfficials says morale has improved since the nuclear forces were rocked by test-cheating and drug scandals under the Obama administration and a 2007 incident under the Bush administration, when the Air Force accidentally flew live nuclear weapons between Minot and another U.S. base. \nHewuse uses her free time to study for a postgraduate degree in entrepreneurship. She has also brightened her capsule by painting the lock used to keep nuclear missile launch keys shut in a cabinet above her head.  \nShe painted the lock gold, with sparkles.  \n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x98m a pretty sparkly person,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s no sunshine in here. So that\xe2\x80\x99s my sunshine.\xe2\x80\x9d \n'

aS' Saudi Aramco\xe2\x80\x99s planned initial public offering remains on track, the company said on Thursday, after Bloomberg reported that the oil company is preparing contingency plans for a possible delay by a few months into 2019. \nSaudi authorities are aiming to list up to 5 percent of the world\xe2\x80\x99s largest oil producer on both the Saudi stock exchange inRiyadh, the Tadawul, and one or more international markets in anIPO that could raise $100 billion. \n\xe2\x80\x9cThe initial public offering of a stake in Saudi Aramco remains on track,\xe2\x80\x9d said Aramco in an email.  \n\xe2\x80\x9cThe IPO process is well under way and Saudi Aramco remains focused on ensuring that all IPO related work is completed to the very highest standards on time.\xe2\x80\x9d \nBloomberg reported on Wednesday the Saudi government is still aiming for the IPO of the state-owned oil giant in the second half of 2018, but that the timetable is getting increasingly tight for what is likely to be the biggest share sale in history.  \nAramco has still not chosen an international venue for the listing although New York and London are seen as leading contenders. It has hired advisers for the deal, but has not chosen global coordinators or bookrunners, banking sources have said. \nReuters reported last month that Saudi Arabia favors New York for the main foreign listing of Aramco, even though some financial and legal advisers have recommended London, citing people familiar with the matter.     \n'

aS' U.S. President Donald Trump blocked a Chinese-backed private equity firm from buying a U.S.-based chipmaker on Wednesday, sending a clear signal to Beijing that Washington will oppose takeover deals that involve technologies with potential military applications. \nCanyon Bridge Capital Partners\xe2\x80\x99 planned $1.3 billion acquisition of Lattice Semiconductor Corp was one of the largest attempted by a Chinese-backed firm in the U.S. microchip sector and was the first announced deal for the buyout fund, which launched last year with a focus on technology investment.    U.S. regulatory scrutiny grew after Reuters reported in November that Canyon Bridge was funded partly by capital from China\xe2\x80\x99s central government and had indirect links to its space program.     \nU.S. defense officials subsequently raised concerns about the Lattice acquisition by a firm backed by the Chinese government. \nPortland, Oregon-based Lattice makes chips known as field-programmable gate arrays, which allow companies to put their own software on silicon chips for different uses. It said it no longer sells chips to the U.S. military, unlike its two biggest rivals, Xilinx Inc and Intel Corp\xe2\x80\x99s Altera.    Trump said in an executive order that Lattice and Canyon Bridge \xe2\x80\x9cshall take all steps necessary to fully and permanently abandon the proposed transaction\xe2\x80\x9d within 30 days. \nTrump\xe2\x80\x99s decision chimes with the views of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), which scrutinizes deals for potential national security threats.     \nU.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said in a statement following the decision that \xe2\x80\x9cCFIUS and the president assess that the transaction poses a risk to the national security of the United States that cannot be resolved through mitigation.\xe2\x80\x9d \nMnuchin added that the national security risk was related to the transfer of intellectual property, the Chinese government\xe2\x80\x99s role in supporting the deal, the importance of semiconductor supply chain integrity to the U.S. government and the U.S. government\xe2\x80\x99s use of Lattice products. \nChina expressed concern about the decision. \n\xe2\x80\x9cWe believe conducting security examinations of investments in sensitive sectors is a country\xe2\x80\x99s legitimate right, but it should not become a tool for advancing protectionism,\xe2\x80\x9d Chinese Commerce Ministry spokesman Gao Feng told a press briefing on Thursday. \nGao said he hoped the United States could view Chinese firms\xe2\x80\x99 acquisitions objectively and provide fair treatment to what was their \xe2\x80\x9cnormal commercial behavior\xe2\x80\x9d. \nLattice and Canyon Bridge said in a joint statement late on Wednesday they had terminated the proposed deal. Lattice also said it is committed to achieving profitable growth. \nCanyon Bridge had said in an earlier statement that it was disappointed in the decision, and called the proposed transaction \xe2\x80\x9can excellent deal for Lattice\xe2\x80\x99s shareholders and its employees.\xe2\x80\x9d \nThe announcement comes at a sensitive time for U.S.-China relations, which are already strained over trade issues and North Korea. The Chinese Communist Party is also preparing to hold its once-every-five-years Congress in October. \nTrump\xe2\x80\x99s decision ends a prolonged campaign by Canyon Bridge and Lattice to seal the deal. Canyon Bridge and Lattice had spent more than eight months trying in vain to persuade CFIUS to clear the acquisition. \nBoth companies had said the deal did not pose any security risks and Canyon Bridge told CFIUS it would double the number of Lattice\xe2\x80\x99s employees in a bid to make the deal more palatable, according to people familiar with the matter who declined to be identified because details of the regulatory process are confidential. \nThe companies\xe2\x80\x99 decision to appeal directly to Trump was a last-ditch gamble. It was the first such deal to hit Trump\xe2\x80\x99s desk and only the fourth time in three decades that an acquisition was put in front of a president after CFIUS recommended against it.  \nTrump has hewed to the presidential tradition of following the advice of national security officials on deals. \nThe U.S. refusal potentially hurts Canyon Bridge\xe2\x80\x99s ability to acquire other Western semiconductor companies. Most of its acquisition targets have U.S. operations, making them subject to a CFIUS review. \nPalo Alto, California-based Canyon Bridge has been working on a bid for British semiconductor company Imagination Technology Group, sources have previously said. If Canyon Bridge clinches that deal, it would also be subject to CFIUS review since Imagination Technologies acquired U.S. chip designer MIPS in 2013. \nWhile Canyon Bridge could choose to divest MIPS, which accounts for a small fraction of Imagination Technologies\xe2\x80\x99 business, there is no certainty that would be enough to resolve all CFIUS issues, according to the sources. \nImagination Technologies declined to comment.  \nInvestors have been skeptical the Lattice deal would get passed since it was announced last November. Lattice shares have been trading below the deal\xe2\x80\x99s $8.30 offer price and were down 1.6 percent in after-hours trading on Wednesday. \nChinese deals awaiting approval include Ant Financial\xe2\x80\x99s $1.2 billion purchase of U.S. money transfer company MoneyGram International Inc and China Oceanwide Holdings Group Co Ltd\xe2\x80\x99s [OWREAC.UL] $2.7 billion acquisition of U.S. insurer Genworth Financial Inc. \nUnic Capital Management\xe2\x80\x99s $580 million acquisition of U.S. semiconductor testing company Xcerra Corp is also awaiting approval, while HNA needs to get CFIUS clearance to buy hedge fund SkyBridge Capital LLC from Anthony Scaramucci, the Trump administration\xe2\x80\x99s former communications director. \nHNA, the Chinese airline-to-financials group, also needs CFIUS approval for its purchase of a 25 percent stake in Old Mutual\xe2\x80\x99s U.S. fund management arm. A person close to HNA said the two deals are \xe2\x80\x9con track\xe2\x80\x9d. \nAnt Financial, which resubmitted the deal for U.S. review in mid-July, is still actively engaged with CFIUS, a person familiar with the matter said. \n\xe2\x80\x9cWe are not commenting on the CFIUS process, but we are continuing to work with the various regulatory agencies and remain focused on closing the transaction by the end of the year,\xe2\x80\x9d Ant Financial said in a statement. \nHNA did not immediately respond to Reuters\xe2\x80\x99 requests for comment. \n'

aS' Credit reporting company Equifax Inc blamed a web server vulnerability in its open-source software, called Apache Struts, for the recent data breach that compromised personal details of as many as 143 million U.S. consumers. \nThe massive data breach had exposed valuable information to hackers between mid-May and July and sent Equifax shares tumbling, the company said last week.  \n\xe2\x80\x9cWe continue to work with law enforcement as part of our criminal investigation, and have shared indicators of compromise with law enforcement,\xe2\x80\x9d Equifax said in a statement on Wednesday. \nCyber security experts said it was among the largest hacks ever recorded and was particularly troubling due to the richness of the information exposed - names, birthdays, addresses and Social Security and driver\xe2\x80\x99s license numbers. \nEquifax said it is determining with the assistance of an independent cybersecurity firm what exact information was compromised during the data breach.  \nEquifax Chief Executive Richard Smith is expected to testify before a U.S. House of Representatives panel on Oct. 3 after nearly 40 states joined a probe of the company\xe2\x80\x99s handling of the breach. \n'

aS' Chinese bitcoin exchange BTCChina will stop all trading from Sept. 30, it said on Thursday, as regulators crack down on the nascent cryptocurrency sector in a bid to stamp out potential financial risks.     \nChina has boomed as a cryptocurrency trading location in recent years, as investors and speculators flocked to domestic exchanges that formerly allowed users to conduct trades for free, boosting demand. \nBTCChina, one of China\xe2\x80\x99s largest bitcoin trading platforms, which also runs an international exchange out of Hong Kong, will stop registration of new users from Thursday, it said on its official microblog.   \n\xe2\x80\x9cWe will stop all trades on the digital trading platform starting Sept. 30,\xe2\x80\x9d it added. Its co-founder, Bobby Lee, told Reuters the move would not affect trading on the BTCC international exchange, however.  \nThe price of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies tumbled after the news. By 1233 GMT, bitcoin was down 18 percent on BTCChina, at 20,510 yuan.  \nOn U.S. exchange Bitstamp, it was down more than 6 percent at $3,632, down from its Sept. 2 record high of nearly $5,000.  \nBTCChina said its decision was based on a Sept. 4 directive from Chinese authorities that expressed concern over investment risks involved in cryptocurrencies and which ordered a ban on initial coin offerings. \nReuters and other media had reported this week, citing sources, that China planned to further ban exchanges that allowed virtual currency trading but the regulator has yet to make an announcement. \nSpokeswomen for OkCoin and Huobi, BTCChina\xe2\x80\x99s main rivals in China, declined to say whether they would announce similar moves. Huobi said it had not received any clear directives from regulators to do so.  \nInvestors in China contributed up to 2.6 billion yuan, or $397 million, worth of cryptocurrencies through initial coin offerings in January-June, state-run media have said, citing data from the National Committee of Experts on Internet Financial Security Technology. \nThe regulators\xe2\x80\x99 crackdown was sparked by fears that Chinese investors were speculatively piling into cryptocurrencies. Last week, they banned the practice of creating and selling digital currencies or tokens to investors to finance start-up projects.     \n'

aS' The use of armed soldiers to patrol alongside pavement cafes and selfie-snapping tourists in European cities since jihadi attacks risks compromising deployments overseas, military leaders say. \nBelgium and major military power France, both active in EU and NATO missions, have cut back training to free up troops and NATO planners fear that over time armies may get better at guarding railway stations and airports than fighting wars. \nSome of the more than 15,000 soldiers serving at home in Europe say tramping the streets is a far cry from the foreign adventures they signed up for and that they feel powerless to defend against militants.  \n\xe2\x80\x9cWe are standing around like flowers pots, just waiting to be smashed,\xe2\x80\x9d said an officer just returned from Afghanistan for guard duty in Belgium, which, like France, has more troops deployed at home than in any single mission abroad. \nSecurity personnel have been targeted in both countries but patrols begun as a temporary measure after Islamic State attacks in 2015 have become permanent fixtures as opinion polls show that people are reassured by soldiers on show at home. \nItaly has had soldiers on the streets since 2008, Britain used them briefly this year and, along with Spain, is prepared for deployments if threat levels rise. Despite their painful history, Germany and Austria have debated having military patrols at home for the first time since World War Two. \nAcross Europe, political debate is shifting from whether, to how to adapt the armed forces to a homeland role, a concern for military leaders eyeing budgets, morale and training. \nFrance\xe2\x80\x99s former military chief, who quit in July, said it had overstretched the army, while the head of Belgium\xe2\x80\x99s land forces told Reuters the domestic deployment was taking its toll. \n\xe2\x80\x9cI see a lot of people who leave our defense forces because of the operation,\xe2\x80\x9d General Marc Thys, the commander of Belgium\xe2\x80\x99s land forces, said in an interview, without giving numbers. \nNot everyone agrees. A defense ministry source in Italy said its domestic patrols had \xe2\x80\x9cabsolutely no impact on overseas missions or on training\xe2\x80\x9d. \nBut some in NATO worry protracted domestic operations will make key members of the 29-strong transatlantic alliance less ready to deploy to Afghanistan or eastern European borders with Russia. \n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is popular with the public, it is cheaper than the police,\xe2\x80\x9d a senior NATO source said. \xe2\x80\x9cBut if the requirement came to send a lot of forces to reinforce our eastern allies ... would the government be willing to pull its soldiers off the street to do that, could it?\xe2\x80\x9d \n\xe2\x80\x9cWORSE THAN AFGHANISTAN\xe2\x80\x9d \nThe challenge of battling Islamic State at home and abroad, squeezes resources just as NATO leaders seek to show U.S. President Donald Trump they are reliable allies, after he repeatedly questioned the alliance\xe2\x80\x99s worth. \nGiven the homeland operations, some military sources and experts say politicians face a tough choice: to expand the army, summon up reserves or create a new domestic security force - a halfway between the police and military - to replace them as Belgium has chosen to do over the coming years. \n\xe2\x80\x9cIt mobilizes so many people that we are having trouble deploying people abroad for U.N. and EU missions,\xe2\x80\x9d said a second NATO source.  \nThe operations put 10,000 heavily armed combat troops on the streets in France and 1,800 in Belgium after Islamic State attacks in early 2015. The numbers are down to 7,000 and 1,200 respectively, but they still tie up roughly a tenth of deployable army personnel in each nation. \nThey can also be bad for morale. \nThe mix of schools, offices and warehouse hastily converted into barracks in Belgium \xe2\x80\x9care worse than Afghanistan,\xe2\x80\x9d said a soldier, showing pictures of cramped rooms piled high with gear. \nSome 45 percent of soldiers surveyed by the Belgian military in December said they were thinking of quitting - many to the police - as being away had strained families and led to divorce. \nA source in the French military, which has not made polling public, said of its street patrols, known as Operation Sentinelle: \xe2\x80\x9cSentinelle is a burden whose impact on soldiers\xe2\x80\x99 morale we\xe2\x80\x99ve never denied.\xe2\x80\x9d \nFor now, Thys said the Belgian armed forces are not pulling back from foreign missions but have less time for training. \xe2\x80\x9cWe take everything into account, our homeland operation and our international missions. If you go up on one side, we have to go down on the other side,\xe2\x80\x9d Thys told Reuters. \nIn France, training days were cut from 90 to 59 days last year, according to a defense ministry report in October. A decline of some 30 percent began with the deployment on home soil, experts say. \n\xe2\x80\x9cThe longer they do it, the less sharp as a military they are,\xe2\x80\x9d said General Sir Richard Barrons, Britain\xe2\x80\x99s former military chief. \xe2\x80\x9cBut once you are committed to this it takes a very brave politician to turn it off.\xe2\x80\x9d \nThe new head of France\xe2\x80\x99s armed forces, which has thousands of troops abroad fighting Islamist militants in the Sahel, Iraq, Syria and elsewhere, says something has to give. \xe2\x80\x9cWe have to choose how to adjust our commitments, to give us back some flexibility, because who knows where the French army will have to deploy in a year,\xe2\x80\x9d General Francois Lecointre was cited by local media as saying earlier this month. \nPresident Emmanuel Macron has announced a strategic review of the street patrols. His new armed forces minister, Florence Parly, said on Tuesday they would not be cut but would be made more flexible. \nIn Italy, where up to 7,000 soldiers help police, a defense ministry source said they were moved around often to keep them from being bored - an approach that France and Belgium will both now put into play. \nItaly has escaped militant attacks so far and troops elsewhere have disarmed or killed would-be attackers - such as a knife-wielding assailant outside the Eiffel tower last month and a suitcase bomber in Brussels in June. \nBut their effectiveness is hard to quantify, and attacks on men in uniform like that in Paris last month - with its familiar pattern of a car plowing into its victims - has renewed fears they may draw fire or shoot in error. \nIn France, three in four voters approve of street patrols, although nearly 40 percent doubt they are effective in combating terrorism. In Belgium, support for the military is 80 percent, up from 20 percent before the mission. \n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a PR operation: nothing more,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wally Struys, a professor emeritus at Belgium Royal Military Academy. \nBut Belgium\xe2\x80\x99s Thys and others see no end to the operations, which give the military an extra argument against years of declining budgets.  \n\xe2\x80\x9cThey are part of the landscape now,\xe2\x80\x9d said Saad Amrani, chief commissioner and policy adviser of the Belgian Federal Police. \xe2\x80\x9cWe depend on them.\xe2\x80\x9d \n'

aS' The United Nations appealed on Thursday for massive help for nearly 400,000 Muslims from Myanmar who have fled to Bangladesh, with concern growing that the number could keep rising, unless Myanmar ends what critics denounce as \xe2\x80\x9cethnic cleansing\xe2\x80\x9d. \nThe Rohingya are fleeing from a Myanmar military offensive in the western state of Rakhine that was triggered by a series of guerrilla attacks on Aug. 25 on security posts and an army camp in which about a dozen people were killed. \nThe United Nations has called for a massive intensification of relief operations to help the refugees, and a much bigger response from the international community. \n\xe2\x80\x9cWe urge the international community to step up humanitarian support and come up with help,\xe2\x80\x9d Mohammed Abdiker, director of operations and emergencies for the International Organisation for Migration, told a news conference in the Bangladeshi capital. The need was \xe2\x80\x9cmassive\xe2\x80\x9d, he added. \nThe violence in Rakhine and the exodus of refugees is the most pressing problem Nobel Peace laureate Aung San Suu Kyi has faced since becoming national leader last year. \nU.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres and the U.N. Security Council on Wednesday urged Myanmar to end the violence, which he said was best described as ethnic cleansing.       \nThe government of Buddhist-majority Myanmar rejects such accusations, saying it is targeting \xe2\x80\x9cterrorists\xe2\x80\x9d. \nNumerous Rohingya villages in the north of Rakhine have been torched but authorities have denied that security forces or Buddhist civilians set the fires. They blame the insurgents, and say 30,000 non-Muslim villagers were also displaced. \nSmoke was rising from at least five places on the Myanmar side of the border on Thursday, a Reuters reporter in Bangladesh said. It was not clear what was burning or who set the fires. \n\xe2\x80\x9cEthnic cleansing\xe2\x80\x9d is not recognized as an independent crime under international law, the U.N. Office on Genocide Prevention says, but it has been used in U.N. resolutions and acknowledged in judgments and indictments of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia. \nA U.N. panel of experts defined it as \xe2\x80\x9crendering an area ethnically homogeneous by using force or intimidation to remove persons of given groups\xe2\x80\x9d.       \nThe crisis has raised questions about Suu Kyi\xe2\x80\x99s commitment to human rights, and could strain relations with Western backers supporting her leadership of Myanmar\xe2\x80\x99s transition from decades of strict military rule and economic isolation. \nCritics have called for her to be stripped of her Nobel prize for failing to do more to halt the strife, though national security remains firmly in the hands of the military. \nSuu Kyi is due to address the nation on Tuesday. \n\xe2\x80\x98INTERNAL AFFAIR\xe2\x80\x99 \nChina, which competes with the United States for influence in Myanmar, endorses the offensive against the insurgents and deemed it an \xe2\x80\x9cinternal affair\xe2\x80\x9d, Myanmar state media said. \n\xe2\x80\x9cThe counterattacks of Myanmar security forces against extremist terrorists and the government\xe2\x80\x99s undertakings to provide assistance to the people are strongly welcomed,\xe2\x80\x9d the Global New Light of Myanmar newspaper quoted China\xe2\x80\x99s ambassador, Hong Liang, as telling government officials. \nBut at the United Nations in New York, China set a different tone, joining a Security Council expression of concern about reports of violence and urging steps to end it. \nThe Security Council met on Wednesday to discuss the crisis and later \xe2\x80\x9cexpressed concern about reports of excessive violence ... and called for immediate steps to end the violence in Rakhine, de-escalate the situation, re-establish law and order, ensure the protection of civilians ... and resolve the refugee problem\xe2\x80\x9d. \nThis week, the Trump administration called for protection of civilians. \nBangladesh says the refugees will have to go home and has called for safe zones in Myanmar. Myanmar says safe zones are unacceptable. \nThe IOM\xe2\x80\x99s Abdiker declined to say how many refugees he thought might end up in Bangladesh. \n\xe2\x80\x9cThe number may rise to 600,000, 700,000, even one million if the situation in Myanmar does not improve,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \nThe most important thing was that the refugees be able to go home safely, said George William Okoth-Obbo, assistant high commissioner for operations at the U.N. refugee agency. \n\xe2\x80\x9cThe international community has to support to ensure their return ... peacefully and with safety,\xe2\x80\x9d he told the news conference. \nOn Wednesday, the Myanmar government said 45 places had been burned. It did not provide details, but a spokesman said out of 471 villages in the north of Rakhine, 176 had been deserted and at least some people had left 34 more. \nThe spokesman, Zaw Htay, said the people going to Bangladesh were either linked to the insurgents, or women and children fleeing conflict. \nGovernment figures show 432 people have been killed, most of them insurgents, since Aug. 25. \nThere are also fears of a humanitarian crisis on the Myanmar side of the border. The government has accused some aid groups of helping the insurgents and has restricted access.  \n'

aS' Emergency workers around hurricane-scarred Florida worked to make sure elderly residents were safe, evacuating multiple assisted-living facilities, after eight people died in a sweltering nursing home that lost its air conditioning in the storm.\nIn one of the latest actions to protect older residents, firefighters helped relocate 122 people late Wednesday from two assisted living centers near Orlando that had been without power since Hurricane Irma.\nStepped-up efforts came after the eight deaths at the Rehabilitation Center at Hollywood Hills, which shocked Florida\'s top leaders even as they surveyed destruction from a storm that spread its punishing effects across the entire state.\n"Unfathomable," Gov. Rick Scott said of the nursing home deaths. "Inexcusable," U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson added.\nIn Coral Gables, an apartment building was evacuated after authorities said its lack of power made it unsafe for elderly tenants. And at the15,000-resident Century Village retirement community in Pembroke Pines, where there were also widespread outages, rescue workers went door to door in the 94-degree heat checking on residents and bringing ice, water and meals.\nFor the elderly outside assisted living facilities, such as 94-year-old Mary Dellaratta, getting help can depend on the attentiveness of neighbors, family and local authorities. The widow evacuated her Naples condominium with the help of police the day before the storm hit. After the hurricane passed, a deputy took her back home and another brought her food. A deacon from her Roman Catholic church has also stopped by.\nBut with no family in the area and neighbors who are gone or unwilling to help, the New York native feels cut off from the world.\n"I have nobody," she said.\nThe electricity is out in her condo, so there\'s no television for news. She also can\'t raise the electric-powered hurricane shutters that cover her kitchen windows.\nNear the point of despair, remembering to take her medicine or locating her cane are almost insurmountable challenges.\n"I don\'t know what to do. How am I going to last here?" she said, as a tear rolled down her cheek.\nThough the number of people with electricity had improved from earlier in the week, some 6.8 million people across the peninsula continued to wait for power, and utility officials warned it could take a week or more for all areas to be back up and running.\nAs recovery continues, President Donald Trump was due to visit Naples in southwestern Florida on Thursday.\nIncluding the nursing home deaths, at least 25 people in Florida have died under Irma-related circumstances, and six more in South Carolina and Georgia, many of them well after the storm had passed. The death toll across the Caribbean stood at 38.\nIn Hollywood, the Rehabilitation Center said the hurricane had knocked out a transformer that powered the air conditioning. Broward County said the home alerted officials Tuesday that it had lost power, but when asked if it had any medical needs or emergencies, it did not request help.\nEarly Wednesday morning, after responding to three calls about patients there in distress, firefighters went through the facility and found three people dead and evacuated more than 150 patients to hospitals, many on stretchers or in wheelchairs, authorities said.\nBy the afternoon, five more had died. Others were treated for dehydration, breathing difficulties and other heat-related problems.\nHollywood Police Chief Tom Sanchez said investigators believe the deaths at the Rehabilitation Center were heat-related and said the a criminal investigation is underway. The chief said authorities have not ruled anything out in the deaths, including carbon monoxide poisoning from generators. Authorities performed safety checks on other facilities around the city Wednesday.\nGlendale Owens, the daughter of one of the men who died, said she visited her father in the nursing home Monday and everything seemed fine. She said Bobby Owens had been at the facility for more than 10 years.\n"People are telling me different things," she said Wednesday evening. "But nobody from the facility has told me anything yet."\nPaulburn Bogle, a member of the housekeeping staff, said after the air conditioning failed, the staff used fans, put cold towels and ice on patients and gave them cold drinks. The medical examiner\'s office said the victims were five women and three men, ages 70 to 99.\nCalls to the owner and other officials at the Hollywood home were not immediately returned, but the facility\'s administrator, Jorge Carballo, said in a statement that it was "cooperating fully with relevant authorities to investigate the circumstances that led to this unfortunate and tragic outcome."\nThe governor announced in a news release Wednesday night that he\'s directed the Agency for Health Care Administration to issue an emergency moratorium for the facility, preventing it from admitting new patients indefinitely.\nNursing homes in Florida are required by law to file an emergency plan that includes evacuation plans for residents. County officials released documents showing that the Hollywood facility was in compliance with that regulation and that it held a hurricane drill with its staff in October.\nAround the state, hazards were popping up in the aftermath of the storm. At least six people in Florida died of apparent carbon monoxide poisoning from generators, and a Tampa man died after the chain saw he was using to remove trees recoiled and cut his carotid artery.\nThe number of people in shelters across the state fell to less than 13,000.\n'

aS' President Donald Trump on Thursday said he was "fairly close" to a deal with congressional leaders to preserve protections for young immigrants living illegally in America, and is insisting on "massive border security" as part of any agreement.\nTrump, speaking to reporters before surveying hurricane damage in Florida, pushed back against Democratic leaders who claimed there was a deal on the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) initiative. He also said his promised wall along the U.S.-Mexico border would "come later."\n"We\'re working on a plan subject to getting massive border controls. We\'re working on a plan for DACA. People want to see that happen," Trump said. He added: "\'I think we\'re fairly close but we have to get massive border security."\nTrump, in a series of early morning tweets, had contradicted the characterization of a private White House dinner on Wednesday night by his guests, Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York and Rep. Nancy Pelosi of California, the top Democrats on Capitol Hill. Trump denied there was a deal.\nSchumer and Pelosi said in a statement after that get-together that they had agreed to "enshrine the protections of DACA into law quickly" and to work out a package on border security, excluding Trump\'s planned border wall.\nNot so, shot back White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders, who said that "while DACA and border security were both discussed, excluding the wall was certainly not agreed to."\nTrump\'s tweets prompted a fresh response from Schumer and Pelosi, who said his words were "not inconsistent with the agreement reached last night," and that while there was "no final deal," the president had said he would "support enshrining DACA protections into law, and encourage the House and Senate to act."\nThey said in a statement that the details on border security needed to be negotiated, that both sides agreed "the wall would not be any part of this agreement" and that Trump said he would pursue the wall later.\nAnd soon after, Trump appeared to confirm that approach. "The wall will come later, we\'re right now renovating large sections of wall, massive sections, making it brand new," he told reporters before his Florida trip.\nHe also said Republican congressional leaders, House Speaker Paul Ryan of Wisconsin and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky favored his approach on the immigration program. "Ryan and McConnell agree with us on DACA," Trump said, adding that he had spoken to them by telephone.\nIt was a head-snapping turn of events for a president inclined recently to turn to Democrats to jump-start legislative imperatives. Only days ago, Trump and the Democratic leaders agreed to back a three-month extension of the debt limit in order to speed hurricane assistance.\n"The WALL, which is already under construction in the form of new renovation of old and existing fences and walls, will continue to be built," Trump tweeted early Thursday.\nAt the same time, he expressed sympathy for the hundreds of thousands of younger immigrants vulnerable to deportation even though they were brought to the United States as toddlers or children. He had announced last week that his administration was rescinding the program and gave Congress six months to come up with a legislative fix.\n"Does anybody really want to throw out good, educated and accomplished young people who have jobs, some serving in the military, really?" Trump wrote. "They have been in our country for many years through no fault of their own - brought in by parents at a young age. Plus BIG border security."\nPelosi spokesman Drew Hammill had said after the White House dinner "the president was clear he would press for the wall but separate from this agreement."\nEither way, it was the second time in two weeks that Trump cut out Republicans to reach a deal with Pelosi and Schumer. A person briefed on the meeting, who spoke on condition anonymity about the private get-together, said the deal specifies bipartisan legislation that would provide eventual citizenship for the young immigrants.\nHouse Republicans would normally rebel over such an approach, which many view as amnesty for lawbreakers. It remains to be seen how conservatives\' loyalty to Trump would affect their response to a policy they would have opposed under other circumstances.\nThe House\'s foremost immigration hard-liner, GOP Rep. Steve King of Iowa, made clear that he was not happy.\nAddressing Trump over Twitter, King wrote that if the reports were true, "Trump base is blown up, destroyed, irreparable, and disillusioned beyond repair. No promise is credible." Breitbart News, an influential publication among Trump\'s base of supporters, referred to the president in a headline as "Amnesty Don."\nEarlier Wednesday, during a White House meeting with moderate House members from both parties, Trump had urged lawmakers to come up with a bipartisan solution.\nThe president said he would be open to separating the wall issue from the question of the younger immigrants, as long as the wall got dealt with eventually.\nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan, in an Associated Press interview Wednesday, said "kicking these 800,000 kids out to countries that they\'ve probably not been to since they were toddlers, in countries that speak languages they may not even know, is not in our nation\'s interest."\nAdded Ryan, R-Wis.: "So I do believe that there\'s got to be a solution to this problem."\nTrump, deeply disappointed by Republicans\' failure to make good on years of promises to repeal the Obama-era health law, infuriated many in his party last week when he reached a three-month deal with Schumer and Pelosi to raise the debt ceiling, keep the government running and speed relief to states affected by recent hurricanes.\n"More and more we\'re trying to work things out together," Trump said Wednesday, calling the development a "positive thing" for both parties.\n"If you look at some of the greatest legislation ever passed, it was done on a bipartisan manner. And so that\'s what we\'re going to give a shot," he said.\n__\nAssociated Press writers Kevin Freking and Ken Thomas contributed to this report.\n'

aS' Five prominent species of ash tree in the eastern U.S. have been driven to the brink of extinction from years of lethal attack by a beetle, a scientific group says.\nTens of millions of trees in the U.S. and Canada have already succumbed, and the toll may eventually reach more than 8 billion, the International Union for Conservation of Nature said Thursday.\nAsh trees are a major part of eastern forests and urban streets, providing yellow and purplish leaves to the bounty of fall colors. Their timber is used for making furniture and sports equipment like baseball bats and hockey sticks.\nThe rampage of the \n ash borer is traced to the late 1990s, when it arrived from Asia in wood used in shipping pallets that showed up in Michigan. Asian trees have evolved defenses against the insect, but the new North American home presented it with vulnerable trees and no natural predators.\n"The populations are exploding," said Murphy Westwood of the Morton Arboretum in Lisle, Illinois. Infestations have been detected in \n"it\'s a very efficient killer," Westwood said. "As the ash borer moves through a forest, it will completely kill all of the mature ash trees within three or four years."\nShe led the scientific assessment that resulted in classifying the five species as critically endangered \xe2\x80\x94 meaning they are facing an extremely high risk of extinction in the wild. The change appears on the IUCN\'s Red List, considered by scientists the official index of what animals and plants are in danger of disappearing. The species are the green, black, white, pumpkin and blue ash.\nA sixth species, the Carolina ash, was put in the less serious category of  "endangered" because it might find some refuge from the infestation in the southern part of its range, which includes Florida, Texas and Cuba, Westwood  said.\nDan Herms, an entomologist at Ohio State University who studies the ash borer, called it "the most devastating insect ever to invade North American forests." It\'s already the most expensive because it has killed so many urban trees that had to be removed, disposed of and replaced, which has cost billions of dollars, he said.\nHerms, who was not involved in the IUCN project, said he\'s not sure the ash species will literally disappear. But he said they could become "functionally extinct," with populations too small to play a significant role in the environment for benefits like providing shelter and filtering water.\n'

aS" A Norwegian archaeologist says a well-preserved, if rusty, iron sword dating to the Viking era has been found in southern Norway.\nLars Holger Piloe says the nearly one-meter-long (3-foot) sword was found slid down between rocks with the blade sticking out, and may have been left by a person who got lost in a blizzard and died on the mountain from exposure.\nPiloe said Thursday the sword, dating from about 850-950 A.D., was found in Lesja, some 275 kilometers (170 miles) north of Oslo.\nPiloe said the sword's preservation was likely due to the quality of the iron, as well as the cold, dry conditions. It was found in late August by two men who were on a reindeer hunt some 1,640 meters (1 mile) above sea level.\n"

The 25-year-old calls the transplant "what I needed to do for my overall health."\nThe post didn\'t reveal Gomez\'s current condition or say where or when the procedure took place. Gomez\'s publicist declined to release more information.\nGomez wrote "there aren\'t words to describe" how she can thank Raisa, who she says gave "the ultimate gift and sacrifice by donating her kidney."\n"I am incredibly blessed," she added.\nThe Instagram post includes a picture of Gomez and Raisa holding hands while lying side-by-side in hospital beds and another photo of a scar on Gomez\'s abdomen. The 29-year-old Raisa is best known for her role on the ABC Family series "The Secret Life of the American Teenager." Raisa\'s publicist didn\'t immediately return a request for comment Thursday.\nGomez revealed her lupus diagnosis in 2015 and took a break from her career last year to deal with anxiety, panic attacks and depression stemming from her battle with the disease. The disease causes fibrous tissue and inflammation of internal organs, skin rashes and joint pain. It affects women nine times more than men. Organs affected by lupus include the kidneys, heart and lungs.\nGomez got her start as a child actress before launching her music career. She appeared on "Barney and Friends" before breaking through as a teen star on the Disney Channel\'s "Wizards of Waverly Place." She has a massive following on social media. Her 126 million followers on Instagram are the most on the platform.\n'

aS' The U.S. House of Representatives on Thursday passed a $1.2 trillion bill to fund most government activities in the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1, knowing the Senate will disagree with many controversial elements and force a negotiation that could stretch into December. \nThe bill, passed by a 211-198 vote largely along party lines in the Republican-controlled House, provides $658.1 billion for the Department of Defense and $44.3 billion for the Department of Homeland Security, including roughly $1.6 billion for construction of physical barriers along the U.S.-Mexican border. \nThe $31.4 billion allotted for the Department of the Interior, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the Forest Service, the Indian Health Service and related agencies cut the EPA\xe2\x80\x99s funding by $534 million when compared to the prior fiscal year. \nThe funding measure also included a provision that would stop the Internal Revenue Service from implementing a provision of the 2010 Affordable Care Act, commonly known as Obamacare, that imposes a tax penalty on individuals who elect to go without health insurance. \nRepresentative Kevin McCarthy, a member of Republican leadership, said the funding measure would make \xe2\x80\x9cmajor changes to the way Washington spends taxpayer dollars.\xe2\x80\x9d \n\xe2\x80\x9cOur funding legislation forces the government to do what it ought to do and to stop doing what it shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t do,\xe2\x80\x9d McCarthy said in a statement, praising it for \xe2\x80\x9cstrengthening our national defense, veterans\xe2\x80\x99 programs, and border security,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9ccutting abusive Washington agencies like the IRS and the EPA.\xe2\x80\x9d \nDemocrats warned that the bill, which bundled together 12 separate funding measures and earned just one Democratic vote, would need substantial revision in the Senate, where Republicans hold 52 of 100 seats but most legislation requires 60 votes for passage. \n\xe2\x80\x9cThese bills cannot be enacted into law because they cannot gain Democratic votes,\xe2\x80\x9d Democratic Representative Nita Lowey said in a statement, calling the House-passed bill \xe2\x80\x9cinadequate and partisan.\xe2\x80\x9d   \n'

aS' San Diego attorney Dulce Garcia has regularly defended clients in immigration court. Now, she is the one seeking legal relief.  \nBrought to the United States illegally by her parents as a child, Garcia is one of six immigrants who sued the Trump administration on Monday over its decision to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, program. Since it was authorized in 2012 by President Barack Obama, the program has provided protection from deportation and the right to work legally to nearly 800,000 young people.  \nGarcia\xe2\x80\x99s case, filed in San Francisco federal court, is the first to be brought by DACA recipients, known as Dreamers, since U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced earlier this month that the Obama-era policy would start winding down in March 2018, according to Garcia\xe2\x80\x99s lawyers.   \nIt is among several lawsuits challenging the decision to end DACA, including two cases brought by state attorneys general. \nThe legal claims in all of the cases, including Garcia\xe2\x80\x98s, are similar: that the Trump administration did not follow proper administrative procedure in rescinding DACA, and that making enforcement promises to a group of people, only to revoke them, violates due process.  \nThe Trump administration has said it is ending DACA because Obama overstepped his constitutional authority when he bypassed Congress and created the DACA program unilaterally. President Donald Trump called on Congress to enact a law to protect DACA recipients and last week angered some of his fellow Republicans by negotiating with top congressional Democratic leaders on possible legislation. \nDuring the 2016 presidential election Trump ran on a hardline immigration platform, promising to end DACA and strengthen border protections in order to increase jobs for U.S. workers.  \n\xe2\x80\x9cI CRIED RIGHT THERE\xe2\x80\x9d \nThe daughter of a hotel housekeeper and a welder, Garcia arrived in Southern California from Mexico at the age of 4. A few years later, she said, her family was ousted from their apartment because the property contained illegal units. \n\xe2\x80\x9cWe were living out of my dad\xe2\x80\x99s truck for a little bit there,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \nGarcia decided to become an attorney after working for a criminal defense lawyer in high school. She put herself through school working for lawyers and performing other jobs such as parking cars. \nAfter Obama announced DACA in 2012, Garcia, now 34, seized the opportunity. When she filled out forms for a social security number in 2013, the government clerk congratulated her. \n\xe2\x80\x9cI cried right there,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \nThe case on behalf of Garcia and other DACA recipients could be heard with two separately filed San Francisco DACA cases, one brought by the University of California and the other by a group of state attorneys general, led by California\xe2\x80\x99s Xavier Becerra. Another group of attorneys general, led by New York\xe2\x80\x99s Eric Schneiderman, filed a lawsuit over DACA on September 6 in Brooklyn federal court.  \nLegal experts have said court challenges to Trump\xe2\x80\x99s decision could face an uphill battle because a president typically has wide authority in implementing immigration policy. \nJirayut \xe2\x80\x9cNew\xe2\x80\x9d Latthivongskorn, another plaintiff in the lawsuit on Monday, was brought to the United States from Thailand when he was nine. Latthivongskorn is now a fourth year medical student at University of California San Francisco and a master\xe2\x80\x99s degree candidate in public health at Harvard. His DACA work authorization expires in January 2019.  \nHis medical residency is not set to begin until a few months after that, and could be impossible if he loses his authorization to work legally. \n\xe2\x80\x9cI have all these big ideas about how I want to change the world and change systems around health care,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cThe fact I might not be able to get there is troubling and frustrating.\xe2\x80\x9d \nGarcia said that having to advise some of her DACA clients that there may be no help for them while at the same time trying to address her own immigration status takes a toll.  \n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s a reason why I don\xe2\x80\x99t do exclusively immigration law,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt would wear me down too fast.\xe2\x80\x9d \n'

aS" President Vladimir Putin arrived at a remote army training ground on Monday to watch a military parachute drop, part of Russia\xe2\x80\x99s biggest war games since 2013 that have the West looking on nervously. \nNATO officials say they are watching the \xe2\x80\x9cZapad-2017\xe2\x80\x9d (\xe2\x80\x9cWest-2017\xe2\x80\x9d) war games with \xe2\x80\x9ccalm and confidence\xe2\x80\x9d, but many are unnerved about what they see as Moscow testing its ability to wage war against the West. Russia says the exercise is rehearsing a purely defensive scenario.  \nThe Russian Defence Ministry said Monday\xe2\x80\x99s parachute drop, at a military facility in the Leningrad region, would see 450 paratroopers and nine armored vehicles dropped from military transport planes, a show of military might that is likely to be heavily covered on state TV.   \nPutin, commander-in-chief of Russia\xe2\x80\x99s armed forces, has often appeared at such events in the past, using them to bolster his image among Russians as a robust defender of the country\xe2\x80\x99s national interests on the world stage. \nThe Russian leader, 64, has not yet said whether he will run for what would be a fourth presidential term in March, but is widely expected to do so. \nOnce the paratroopers and their vehicles have landed behind the lines of their simulated enemy, their task will be to wage war against what the defense ministry in a statement called \xe2\x80\x9cillegal armed formations\xe2\x80\x9d and to destroy their opponents\xe2\x80\x99 vital infrastructure and command centers. \nThe over-arching Zapad war games run to Sept. 20 and are taking place in Belarus, western Russia and Russia\xe2\x80\x99s exclave of Kaliningrad.  \n(For a graphic on Russia's Zapad war games click \n)  \nMoscow says almost 13,000 Russian and Belarussian service personnel are taking part, as well as around 70 planes and helicopters.

aS' The United States on Thursday will announce that it will extend wide sanctions relief for Iran under the 2015 nuclear deal, sources familiar with the matter said, but no decision on whether to preserve the deal itself has yet been made. \nAt the same time, the U.S. Treasury announced new cyber-related sanctions on about a dozen Iranian individuals or entities. \nThe United States will renew a waiver of the key, and most punitive, sanctions that it imposed on Iran before the nuclear deal was ultimately struck, the sources said.  \nTucked into Section 1245 of the 2012 National Defense Authorization Act, Washington threatened to sanction the banks of Iran\xe2\x80\x99s main oil customers if they did not significantly cut their purchases of Iranian crude. \nUnder the law, these sanctions can be waived for a maximum of 120 days, forcing the U.S. government to revisit the issue every four months. Former President Barack Obama\xe2\x80\x99s administration, which negotiated the deal, did so in mid-January and President Donald Trump\xe2\x80\x99s administration did so again on May 17. \nSources familiar with the matter stressed that the wider U.S. policy toward Iran, and whether to preserve the deal that gave Tehran sanctions relief in exchange for curbing its nuclear program, has yet to be decided. Trump has criticized the deal, but some of his top advisers believe he should preserve it. \nEven as it prepared to waive the oil-related sanctions, the Treasury Department announced new sanctions on 11 entities and individuals for \xe2\x80\x9cengaging in support of designated Iranian actors or malicious cyber-enabled activity,\xe2\x80\x9d including two entities based in Ukraine. \nThe Treasury alleged the firms and individuals were either engaging in activity that supported Iran\xe2\x80\x99s ballistic missile program or its Quds Force, or engaging in cyber attacks against the U.S. financial system. \nThe action freezes any assets they may hold in the United States and generally prohibits U.S. individuals from doing business with them.     \n'

aS' Three suicide attacks claimed by Islamic State killed at least 60 people in southern Iraq on Thursday, a health official and police sources said, suggesting a shift in the ultra-hardline group\xe2\x80\x99s tactics since it lost control of its stronghold in Mosul. \nIraqi and Kurdish security officials say the Sunni militants are likely to wage a guerrilla war in Iraq after their self-proclaimed caliphate in Mosul collapsed. \nIslamic State is also under siege in the Syrian city of Raqqa, its operational base for attacks in the Middle East and the West. \nSecurity officials described Thursday\xe2\x80\x99s attacks as an attempt to send a message to Islamic State followers that the group is still strong and can operate in other parts of Iraq following its territorial losses. \n\xe2\x80\x9cAfter losing the war in Iraq and the shrinking of its power, Daesh returned back to its old style of an insurgency, by carrying out suicide attacks, which is a clear sign that the terrorist group is retreating,\xe2\x80\x9d said police intelligence colonel Murtatha al-Yassiri. \nIS activity is usually concentrated in western and northern Iraq. Bomb attacks in the mostly Shi\xe2\x80\x98ite south, where the bulk of the country\xe2\x80\x99s oil is produced and security forces hold a tighter grip, have so far been relatively rare. \nLike its predecessor in Iraq, al Qaeda, Islamic State seeks to create sectarian tensions as a way to destabilize the OPEC oil producer. \n\xe2\x80\x9cWe expect more alike terrorist operations in future. Daesh is trying to desperately pretend among followers that it\xe2\x80\x99s still strong,\xe2\x80\x9d al-Yassiri said. \nDaesh is an Arabic acronym for Islamic State, which is also known as ISIS. \nWearing security force uniforms and driving stolen army vehicles, the attackers targeted a police checkpoint and two restaurants on a highway near the city of Nassiriya, using car bombs and suicide vests, the sources said. \nAt least 100 people were injured, the police said in a statement. \nIslamic State claimed responsibility in a statement on its Amaq news agency. The group said it had killed \xe2\x80\x9cdozens of Shi\xe2\x80\x98ites\xe2\x80\x9d. \nThe head of Nassiriya\xe2\x80\x99s health directorate, Jassim al-Khalidi, said the city\xe2\x80\x99s hospital had received 50 bodies and the death toll could rise because some of the wounded were in critical condition. \nHospital sources said at least 10 Iranian pilgrims, who were visiting holy Shi\xe2\x80\x98ite shrines, were among the dead. \nThe deadliest attack was at a restaurant west of Nassiriya. \xe2\x80\x9cOne attacker blew up his suicide vest inside the crowded restaurant while a group of other gunmen started to throw grenades and fire at diners,\xe2\x80\x9d said police colonel Ali Abdul Hussain. \nPolice sources said some police officers had died in the checkpoint attack, but the toll from that incident remained unclear. \nSecurity sources said forces were placed on alert in most of the southern provinces, including the oil city of Basra, in case of similar attacks. \n'

aS' Nestle has bought a majority stake in Blue Bottle Coffee, stepping into the world of high-end specialty coffee bars. \nThe Swiss maker of Nescafe instant coffee and Nespresso pods announced the purchase on Thursday without disclosing financial terms. \nThe move comes amid consolidation in the so-called third-wave coffee sector in the United States. This market caters to discerning customers who have grown up on Starbucks but have progressed to more exotic coffee drinks coaxed from traditional espresso machines or made by expert baristas. \nNestle, the world\xe2\x80\x99s biggest coffee company, said that Blue Bottle would continue to operate as a standalone entity and that current management and employees would retain a minority stake. \nCalifornia-based Blue Bottle has raised nearly $121 million in funding from high-profile investors including Twitter co-founder Ev Williams, Fidelity and GV (Google Ventures), according to data compiled by Crunchbase. \nThe company operates minimalist-style coffee bars in major U.S. cities and Japan.

aS' The Republican attacks that accompanied the firing of FBI Director James Comey have sharply intensified in the last two weeks, with broadsides delivered on Twitter, public statements and even from the White House podium.\nComey, who in June said President Donald Trump and the White House had lied about him and the law enforcement agency he led, has been repeatedly accused of delivering false testimony, of prematurely exonerating Hillary Clinton for her use of a private email server and of improperly leaking details about his private conversations with the president.\nThe attacks, which come as Congress and federal investigators probe the circumstances of his dismissal, appear clearly designed to undercut the credibility of a veteran lawman whose testimony and vivid first-person accounts loom as central to special counsel Robert Mueller\'s investigation.\nThough Trump\'s lawyers over the summer had been mulling ways to undermine the legitimacy of Mueller\'s investigation, the stepped-up salvos suggest White House officials and Trump\'s legal team see Comey \xe2\x80\x94 who, despite enjoying broad support from within the FBI, also received bipartisan criticism for his handling of the Clinton probe \xe2\x80\x94 as a more vulnerable target for attack.\nJay Sekulow, one of Trump\'s lawyers, told The Associated Press this week that he did not consider Comey to be a "credible witness" and that there were multiple reasons for Comey\'s firing.\n"I\'m not looking at this as a legal strategy. I\'m just discussing facts. Read Hillary Clinton\'s book," said Sekulow, referring to the newly released post-mortem of last year\'s election that harshly criticizes Comey\'s oversight of the email investigation.\nBut there\'s also no question that attempts to sully Comey\'s reputation, and to characterize him as a rogue and ineffective leader, are also aimed at undercutting any potential obstruction of justice allegations arising from the May 9 firing and at planting the idea that the dismissal was the culmination of legitimate performance concerns \xe2\x80\x94 not an effort to railroad the Russia probe.\n"I think there\'s a recognition that if there were to be an obstruction case, the credibility of Jim Comey will be a central issue \xe2\x80\x94 no different than the credibility of a central, critical witness to any other case," said Jacob Frenkel, a Washington defense lawyer who has followed the investigation.\n"The best time to cast doubt on a witness\' reputation or reliability," he added, "is before any case actually hits the courtroom or Congress in a charging document."\nThe attacks on Comey\'s performance aren\'t surprising given the White House\'s labored, and evolving, efforts to explain the firing.\nOfficials initially said Trump was acting on the recommendation of his Justice Department, which produced a scathing assessment of his handling of the Clinton investigation.  But that explanation unraveled days later when Trump said he would have fired Comey regardless of recommendation, and was further weakened when it was revealed that Trump and an aide had earlier drafted, but not sent, a letter meant to rationalize the planned dismissal. That draft memo is in Mueller\'s possession.\nThe criticism of Comey began immediately after his firing, when White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders claimed to have personally heard from many unsatisfied FBI agents about low morale at the bureau. But it has escalated in the last two weeks. Sen. Chuck Grassley, the Republican chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, released segments of interviews with FBI officials that show Comey had begun contemplating how to close the Clinton email investigation without charges months before Clinton and other key aides had been interviewed by agents.\nThe following morning, Trump tweeted, "Wow, looks like James Comey exonerated Hillary Clinton long before the investigation was over...and so much more. A rigged system!"\nThis week, Sanders said she thought Comey should be investigated by the Justice Department for disclosing private memos to the media.\n"James Comey\'s leaking of information, making questionable statements under oath, politicizing an investigation_those are real reasons for why he was fired," Sanders said.\nYet no memos were released by Comey. Instead, a friend of Comey shared portions of the notes with reporters and has said none of the material was marked classified. Comey was already gone by the time the existence of the memos was made public, and he has steadfastly denied that politics factored into his decision.\nTrump\'s own relationship with Comey had been frayed for months. The president has said he was angry when Comey, in a private meeting in January, shared with him details from a dossier of salacious allegations about ties between Russia and the campaign. Comey has said Trump later asked him for a loyalty pledge and to end an investigation into former national security adviser Michael Flynn.\nThe attacks have been galling to current and former FBI agents who were personally and professionally fond of Comey.\nHis reputation for independence was sealed by the revelation that, as deputy attorney general during the George W. Bush administration, he had threatened to resign over the renewal of a domestic surveillance program. Though those same tendencies put him at odds with presidential administrations \xe2\x80\x94 he publicly broke with the Obama White House on race and policing, and aggravated officials by departing from standard protocol during the Clinton investigation \xe2\x80\x94 employee surveys show he maintained abiding support and respect from the FBI\'s rank-and-file.\n"For us to have to sit through the attacks on his character, his integrity, to see attempts to paint a picture that is completely the opposite of what we knew ... it\'s very hard to stomach," said Frank Montoya, a retired FBI supervisor.\nBut that audience isn\'t necessarily who Sanders is trying to win over.\n"Those who hold Jim Comey in the highest regard for integrity and performance always will do so regardless of public relations positioning," Frenkel said. "These efforts have nothing to do with a message to the FBI or a message to the legal community. This is likely about creating a perception for potential jurors should that ever become an issue."\n'

aS' Confronted with back-to-back major hurricanes, the American Red Cross has received a huge outpouring of financial support \xe2\x80\x94 and a simultaneous barrage of criticism based on its struggles to respond to several past disasters.\nTo date, combined donations to the Red Cross for hurricanes Harvey and Irma have topped $300 million. Former President Barack Obama tweeted a link to a Red Cross fundraising site. Many pro sports teams, celebrities and major corporations have announced large donations.\nYet even in the early stages of the response to Harvey in Texas, a NoRedCross hashtag circulated widely on Twitter. Some prominent journalists wrote articles suggesting that people should not donate to the organization. The New York Times, in an editorial, urged prospective donors to be skeptical.\n"Its record on large-scale operations is spotty," said the editorial, asserting that "there has been less accountability than Americans might expect emanating from its grand marble headquarters in Washington."\nThe criticism has been stinging to Red Cross volunteers, many of whom have taken to social media to rebut the negative commentary.\n"I worry that our volunteers need to feel appreciated," Red Cross President Gail McGovern said in a telephone interview. "After 12-hour shifts, they come back to their hotel really exhausted. They don\'t want to read this stuff."\nSome local officials in Texas and Florida have complained about glitches in the Red Cross response to Harvey and Irma, while others have expressed thanks. But much of the current mistrust of the Red Cross arises from the aftermath of other major disasters over the past 16 years.\nAfter the 2001 terror attacks, the Red Cross irked many donors by earmarking some 9/11 gifts for unrelated purposes, including future needs. It was widely criticized for its response to Hurricane Katrina in 2005, and afterward acknowledged problems that included overwhelmed volunteers, inadequate anti-fraud measures and too few strong partnerships with local charities and civic groups.\nMore recently, investigative reporting by Pro Publica and National Public Radio made the case that the Red Cross responses to the Haiti earthquake in 2010 and Superstorm Sandy in 2012 were flawed in multiple ways. One key allegation was that the Red Cross failed to adequately document how it was spending the $488 million it raised for its work in Haiti.\nLast year, the Red Cross posted a detailed \n of its spending in Haiti. But that did not deter some critics from using social media as the new hurricanes arrived to post Haiti-related headlines like this: "How Red Cross Raised Half a Billion Dollars and Built Only Six Homes."\n"People are repeating and retweeting this stuff instead of taking time to research," said McGovern, a former professor of marketing at Harvard who took over as Red Cross president in 2008 after years of rapid leadership turnover.\nMcGovern said she took solace in evidence of continued public support \xe2\x80\x94 the strong flow of donations and the signing up of about 40,000 new volunteers during the hurricanes. The organization ran scores of emergency shelters in Texas and the Southeast and says it already has provided more than $45 million in financial assistance to more than 100,000 hurricane-stricken households in Texas.\nFor both Harvey and Irma, the Red Cross is among the hurricane-response groups recommended by Charity Navigator, a watchdog group that rates charities on their finances and transparency. On the Charity Navigator website, several hundred \n about the Red Cross were posted, including visceral exchanges between supporters and critics.\nCharity Navigator\'s president, Michael Thatcher, says the Red Cross "is under pretty intense scrutiny" and he hopes the result is improved accountability.\n"It\'s a hard job to be able to ramp up quickly and deploy volunteer resources and expert resources at the drop of a hat," he said. "Are they perfect? No. I would love to see them do better, but I definitely want them to hang around."\nBob Ottenhoff, president and CEO of the Center for Disaster Philanthropy, urged the Red Cross to be as specific as possible in explaining how emergency donations will be spent, both short-term and long-term.\n"Part of why the Red Cross got in difficulty is they\'re raising money in such large quantities they can\'t use it all for the reasons people gave it," he said.\nAnother source of concern to some critics is McGovern\'s salary of just over $500,000. The Red Cross defends it as being in the normal range for leaders of major national nonprofits.\nIn the wake of various past controversies, the Government Accountability Office issued a detailed report about the Red Cross in 2015, recommending that Congress establish some sort of federally overseen process for regular, independent evaluations of Red Cross disaster services. The Red Cross contended that existing evaluation mechanisms were adequate, and the GAO\'s proposal has not been implemented.\nCongress chartered the Red Cross in 1900 to play a central role in responding to domestic and international disasters, though it does not receive federal funding for this purpose on a regular basis.\nMcGovern says the Red Cross wants to be as transparent as possible about its handling of donations. It\'s too early now to outline long-term plans for the Harvey and Irma donations, but that issue will be broached in a one-month-later report, she said.\nIn Houston, more than 50 groups, local and national, are raising money for recovery from Harvey. The distrust of established organizations like the Red Cross has driven many donors to new initiatives. Notably, Houston Texans star J.J. Watt has raised more than $30 million for his foundation, largely through appeals on his social media accounts.\nThe Red Cross remains dominant, raising more than $200 million on its own for Harvey relief. About $40 million has gone to a local fund set up by Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner and Harris County\'s top official, Judge Ed Emmett. They openly urge donors to forego contributions to the Red Cross.\nEmmett blames the Red Cross for problems that arose with setting up and running the emergency shelters used by tens of thousands of people flooded out of their homes.\nThe major shelter for several days was the George R. Brown Convention Center in downtown Houston. Originally setting a capacity of 5,000 people, the Red Cross ended up with double that number in three days. It ran out of cots. Some people slept on strips of cardboard or the floor until more cots arrived. Others said they were not getting enough food.\nDavid Brady, CEO of the Red Cross for the Texas Gulf Coast region, said the group\'s volunteers and staff were doing the best they could during a chaotic and unprecedented storm. Many Red Cross volunteers slept on cots at the shelter themselves.\n"There are challenges that we and everyone else faced during the storm," Brady said. "We always look at how we can serve better."\n'

aS' Eight U.S. special operations forces were injured Thursday during a training exercise at Fort Bragg, according to an Army spokesman.\nThe soldiers were taken to the Womack Army Medical Center on base for treatment, said Lt. Col. Rob Bockholt, a spokesman for the U.S. Army\'s Special Operations Command, which is based at Fort Bragg.\nBockholt didn\'t know the extent of the soldiers\' injuries.\nInitial reports said the injuries happened in an explosion, but Bockholt says he could not confirm that.\n"There was an incident that occurred on one of the ranges," Bockholt said, adding that the command is investigating. "We\'re looking into exactly what happened."\nAbout 57,000 military personnel are attached to Fort Bragg, located next to Fayetteville, North Carolina. It is the largest Army installation by population and one of the largest in the world, covering about 161,000 acres.\nThe Special Operations Command has about 23,000 soldiers spread over several sites.\n'

aS' Insurers are counting on real-time technology to help them cut back payouts, from a system warning ships of nearby pirates to an app offering to buy\xc2\xa0sleepy drivers a coffee on the motorway. \nThe lure of products promising to save on claims in a highly competitive market has led to a leap in investment in \xe2\x80\x9cinsurtech\xe2\x80\x9d in Europe to more than $400 million (294 million pounds) in the first half of 2017, from just $50 million a year ago. \nThe aim is to move insurance from a \xe2\x80\x9cgrudge\xe2\x80\x9d purchase, when the only interaction with customers is after something has gone wrong, to a \xe2\x80\x9cnudge\xe2\x80\x9d product, encouraging safer behaviour. \nWhile the idea is not entirely new, the technology is making it more prevalent, prompting warnings from regulators about the risk of discrimination. \nInsurers say they can navigate those hazards as they explore blockchain - tamper-proof databases shared and updated across a network - \xe2\x80\x9cbig data\xe2\x80\x9d, analysing reams of information for trends, as well as the artificial intelligence technology behind driverless cars, drones and voice-recognition software. \n\xe2\x80\x9dThe new technologies have the potential to change the game (from compensation to risk mitigation),\xe2\x80\x9d said Simon Tottman, head of insurance research, UK & Ireland, for consultants Accenture. \nThe biggest surge of insurtech investment was in Britain, where, despite the vote to leave the European Union, it hit $279 million in the six months to end-June from $9 million a year earlier, analysis by Accenture of data from CB Insights showed. \nIn the rest of Europe, investment jumped to $134 million from $37 million and some insurers are also forming partnerships with insurtech firms. \nA focus in Britain on analysis of social media to assess the probability of claims has fuelled concerns about data security. British motor insurer Admiral had to abandon plans last year to take data from Facebook to set insurance premiums following objections by the social media firm. \nThe Federation of German Consumer Organisations (VZBV) sees risks from big data in personal insurance outweighing benefits, fearing it will shift insurance from spreading risk collectively to being an arbiter of social norms. \nNew European Union data protection legislation coming into force in 2018 should strengthen consumer rights, according to a discussion paper published by European supervisory authorities in Dec 2016, which warned financial institutions to consider the legal dimensions of processing social media data. \nEuropean regulators also worry about social exclusion, and are checking whether data is being used in a way that makes insurance too expensive for those regarded as a higher risk. \nAndrew Brem, chief digital officer at UK insurer Aviva, which is aiming to invest 100 million pounds over the next few years in insurtech start-ups, says the aim is only to promote less risky behaviour. \n\xe2\x80\x9dIn our sector, technology can be very powerful in helping people make smarter choices,\xe2\x80\x9d said Brem, whose company has an insurtech-focused office in a converted garage in London\xe2\x80\x99s so-called Silicon Roundabout area in the east of the city. \nHealth app Tictrac, due to start working with Aviva later this year, tracks exercise, sleep patterns and the weight of employees in corporate healthcare, offering tips and setting challenges to help prevent the onset of costly conditions. \n\xe2\x80\x9cCompanies don\xe2\x80\x99t get any access to their employees\xe2\x80\x99 data,\xe2\x80\x9d said Martin Blinder, Trictrac CEO. \xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99re able to see aggregated, anonymised utilisation trends.\xe2\x80\x9d \nThe largest UK investment this year was in the domestically focused insurer Gryphon, which is awaiting regulatory approval to offer tailored life, critical illness and income protection insurance via financial advisers using cloud-based technology. \nTelematics - black boxes in cars which enable insurers to check customers\xe2\x80\x99 driving and reward safer habits - have been in use for a while. \nAnton Ossip, CEO of Discovery Insure, owned by Johannesburg-based financial services firm Discovery Ltd, said accident claims had dropped more than 11 percent since it began using customers\xe2\x80\x99 driving information in pricing in 2011. \nKenny Leitch, global connected insurance director at UK insurer RSA said it had paid nearly 2 million pounds in cash rewards to young drivers for safe driving using telematics. \nInsurtech firms are now looking at how to use telematics in real time to prevent accidents. For example, said Tottman, an app may suggest a coffee at a service station at the insurer\xe2\x80\x99s expense if it detects tiredness in a driver\xe2\x80\x99s voice. \nConsultancy EY, data security firm Guardtime, Microsoft and ship operator Maersk are building the first blockchain-based marine insurance platform. \n\xe2\x80\x9cThe shared ledger can alert a ship in Somali waters that it\xe2\x80\x99s approaching an area where pirates have just hijacked another ship,\xe2\x80\x9d said Shaun Crawford, global insurance leader at EY. \nAXA also has a strategic fund investing in insurtech startups and investments by Allianz\xe2\x80\x99s 430 million euro ($513 million) fund include U.S. firm Lemonade, a digital peer-to-peer insurer that uses artificial intelligence and behavioural economics. \nThe U.S. pulled in $4.4 billion in insurtech investment between 2010 and 2016, compared with $1.3 billion in the Asia-Pacific region and $300 million in Europe, according to Accenture\xe2\x80\x99s analysis of CB Insights data. \nMore than half the 100-plus insurers surveyed by  consultants Capgemini said they wanted to partner with insurtech firms, according to its annual World Insurance Report published last week with trade body Efma. \nMurray Raisbeck, global co-head of fintech at consultants KPMG said some inroads by insurers into technology were still largely a public relations exercise, but insurtech was becoming a \xe2\x80\x9cpermanent feature\xe2\x80\x9d of the market. \n'

aS'A year ago, when President Barack Obama \n that, given Myanmar\xe2\x80\x99s progress on democracy, the United States would lift remaining sanctions on Myanmar\xe2\x80\x99s military, rights groups warned that \n was premature: The country\xe2\x80\x99s democratic transition was incomplete, they said, the military retained vast powers and its record on human rights was dismal.\nIt is now tragically clear that those concerns were well founded. The Myanmar military\xe2\x80\x99s vicious crackdown against the Muslim Rohingya minority in Rakhine State has caused at least \n to flee to Bangladesh in the past few weeks alone. On Sept. 11, the United Nations human rights chief, Zeid Ra\xe2\x80\x99ad al-Hussein, accused Myanmar of carrying out \xe2\x80\x9ca textbook example of \n\xe2\x80\x9d against the Rohingya.\nMuch blame has been heaped on Myanmar\xe2\x80\x99s leader, the democracy activist and Nobel Peace Prize winner Daw Aung San Suu Kyi. That is\n: Instead of condemning the military crackdown, she has complained that reports of ethnic cleansing are a \xe2\x80\x9chuge iceberg of misinformation.\xe2\x80\x9d Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi, however, has no direct control over the military. The person most responsible for the ethnic cleansing of the Rohingya \xe2\x80\x94 and who has the power to stop it \xe2\x80\x94 is \n, the commander in chief.\nOn Monday, the White House issued a\n of concern about \xe2\x80\x9cmassive displacement and victimization\xe2\x80\x9d of people in Rakhine State and called for Myanmar\xe2\x80\x99s authorities to \xe2\x80\x9crespect the rule of law, stop the violence\xe2\x80\x9d and put in place the recommendations of a \n led by a former United Nations secretary general, Kofi Annan, to address the root causes of the Rohingya\xe2\x80\x99s plight, including denial of citizenship for them. On Tuesday, the European Parliament adopted a \n condemning the situation and, on Wednesday, the \n called for \xe2\x80\x9cimmediate steps to end the violence in Rakhine.\xe2\x80\x9d\nThese are welcome words, but there is no indication that General Min Aung Hlaing cares a hoot what the world thinks. The only thing that may get his attention is what forced the military to accept a measure of democracy in Myanmar: economic sanctions.\nYet with \n backing Myanmar\xe2\x80\x99s military, there is little chance the Security Council will vote for new sanctions. There is nothing, however, to stop the United States from acting on its own. Senator John McCain\xe2\x80\x99s \n on Tuesday that he would seek to halt plans to expand military ties with Myanmar is a step in the right direction. The Senate could go further and move to restore sanctions against Myanmar\xe2\x80\x99s military unless the carnage stops, humanitarian aid groups are allowed back into Rakhine State, United Nations investigators are permitted to do their job there and the Rohingya are restored safely to their homes as full citizens of Myanmar.\n'

aS'The Trump administration is unflinching in its misbegotten campaign to protect the coal industry from what has become an obvious and inevitable decline. Eight months in, the administration has already killed, or is in the process of killing, rules that would prevent the dumping of coal mining wastes in streams, impose a temporary moratorium on new mine leases in the West, and reduce greenhouse gas emissions from coal-fired power plants \xe2\x80\x94 one of President Barack Obama\xe2\x80\x99s most important efforts to resist climate change. All of this to prop up an industry whose workers would be best served not by false promises of new mining jobs, but by aggressive programs to retrain them for a changing economy.\nThe latest ritualistic bow from Scott Pruitt, the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency who has presented himself as an industry savior, was to order last week \n of the Obama administration\xe2\x80\x99s tighter controls on lead, mercury, arsenic and other coal plant wastes that threaten human health. Delaying the rule\xe2\x80\x99s effective date to November 2020, Mr. Pruitt said, merely \xe2\x80\x9cresets the clock.\xe2\x80\x9d\nWhat it does, rather, is to try to twist the clock back to the day when coal was essentially a monopoly fuel, a day that practical-minded utility executives know is long gone. In fact, these executives are busily shutting down coal-fired plants in favor of more affordable energy sources like natural gas and wind and solar power.\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re not going to build any more coal plants; that\xe2\x80\x99s not going to happen,\xe2\x80\x9d Chris Beam, head of Appalachian Power, West Virginia\xe2\x80\x99s largest utility, bluntly told the state last April, despite President Trump\xe2\x80\x99s phantasmagorical campaign promise to resurrect lost jobs for coal miners. No less candid, Lynn Good, the head of Duke Energy, America\xe2\x80\x99s largest utility, defended the closing of 12 coal plants across five years, with more to come, in order to cut the company\xe2\x80\x99s coal-fired energy output by a third: \xe2\x80\x9cOur strategy will continue to be to drive carbon out of our business.\xe2\x80\x9d\nIn February, one of the nation\xe2\x80\x99s biggest coal-fired plants, the Navajo Generating Station in Arizona, set plans to shut down by the end of 2019 \xe2\x80\x94 more than two decades earlier than expected \xe2\x80\x94 in order to turn to alternatives, cut consumer prices and shed the notoriety of being the third-worst carbon polluter in the nation, according to the ratings of the (pre-Trump) E.P.A.\nWhile environmental rules have played some role in the closing of coal-fired plants, the main driver is cheaper and abundant natural gas. Coal\xe2\x80\x99s use in power generation has been declining since 2007, and by 2016 coal-fired plants produced only 30 percent of the nation\xe2\x80\x99s total generation, compared with 50 percent in 2003.\nThe trend will continue; an estimated 46-plus coal-fired units will close at 25 electricity plants in 16 states over the next five years, \n Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis. In its outlook for 2017, the institute skewered Mr. Trump\xe2\x80\x99s campaign vows, saying, \xe2\x80\x9cPromises to create more coal jobs will not be kept \xe2\x80\x94 indeed the industry will continue to cut payrolls.\xe2\x80\x9d\nAbout 60,000 coal industry jobs have been lost since 2011, and three of the four major mining companies have gone bankrupt, according to a new study by Columbia University\xe2\x80\x99s \n. Even so, Mr. Trump remains obstinate in his \xe2\x80\x9cwar on coal\xe2\x80\x9d statements and steadfast to his bloated campaign promises to laid-off miners, despite expert opinion, expressed in the study, that lifting vital environmental controls \xe2\x80\x9cwill not materially improve\xe2\x80\x9d the coal industry\xe2\x80\x99s prospects.\nIt is shocking that an administration led and staffed by supposedly shrewd business executives deliberately overlooks the blossoming of profitable and cleaner energy products simply because of Mr. Trump\xe2\x80\x99s hollow showmanship before his campaign base.\nUntil now, the E.P.A. and the environmental safeguards Congress has ordered it to enforce have been crucial to the development of new technologies. To have Mr. Pruitt sully that history with false promises to a fading industry is irresponsible.\n'

aS' The student accused of shooting a classmate to death at a Washington state high school and wounding three others had posted videos online showing him playing with guns, including one where he pretends to hunt for a drug dealer.\nClassmates at Freeman High School in the tiny town of Rockford, south of Spokane, knew about the videos. Junior Paul Fricke told The Spokesman-Review newspaper (\n ) that "we knew he had an assault rifle, because he uses it in his YouTube videos."\nIn one, the suspect and a friend display several guns, including what appear to be airsoft weapons and one actual rifle, and act out a scenario where they search for an imaginary neighborhood drug dealer.\nAnother student described the suspect as obsessed with previous school shootings.\nHe was set to make his first appearance in juvenile court in Spokane on Thursday, a day after authorities say he opened fire in a hallway, killing one student and wounding three others before a custodian stopped him.\nWitnesses described a panicked scene when shots rang out Wednesday, with bullets hitting the ceiling and students screaming and running down the hallway.\nArmed with a pistol and rifle, classmates say the shooter\'s face "was passive" when he tried to fire a weapon.

aS' U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson accused North Korea on Friday of threatening the entire world, after Pyongyang fired a missile over Japan for the second time in under a month in defiance of international pressure over its missile and nuclear programs. \nIn the latest attempt to deal with an issue that has repeatedly frustrated world powers, the U.N. Security Council was due to meet at 3 p.m. ET (1900 GMT) on Friday to discuss the missile launch, at the request of the United States and Japan. \nThe council\xe2\x80\x99s 15 members unanimously stepped up sanctions against North Korea over a nuclear bomb test it staged on Sept. 3, imposing a ban on North Korea\xe2\x80\x99s textile exports and capping its imports of crude oil. \nNorth Korea has launched dozens of missiles under leader Kim Jong Un as it accelerates a weapons program designed to give it the ability to target the United States with a powerful, nuclear-tipped missile. \nTillerson said in a speech to foreign officials that the tests threaten the world and stressed the United States was working closely with regional allies Japan and South Korea. \n\xe2\x80\x9cIn East Asia, an increasingly aggressive and isolated regime in North Korea threatens democracies in South Korea, Japan, and more importantly, and more recently, has expanded those threats to the United States, endangering the entire world,\xe2\x80\x9d Tillerson said. \nTaking a tougher line than Tillerson, White House National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster said the United States was fast running out of patience for diplomatic solutions on North Korea. \n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve been kicking the can down the road, and we\xe2\x80\x99re out of road,\xe2\x80\x9d McMaster told reporters. \n\xe2\x80\x9cFor those ... who have been commenting on a lack of a military option, there is a military option,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, adding that it would not be the Trump administration\xe2\x80\x99s preferred choice. \nNorth Korea\xe2\x80\x99s latest test missile flew over Hokkaido in northern Japan on Friday and landed in the Pacific about 2,000 km (1,240 miles) to the east, the Japanese government said. \nIt traveled about 3,700 km (2,300 miles) in total, according to South Korea\xe2\x80\x99s military, far enough to reach the U.S. Pacific territory of Guam, which the North has threatened before. \n\xe2\x80\x9cThe range of this test was significant since North Korea demonstrated that it could reach Guam with this missile,\xe2\x80\x9d the Union of Concerned Scientists advocacy group said in a statement. However, the accuracy of the missile, still at an early stage of development, was low, it said.      \nOn Thursday, Tillerson called on China, Pyongyang\xe2\x80\x99s only ally, and Russia to apply more pressure on North Korea by \xe2\x80\x9ctaking direct actions of their own.\xe2\x80\x9d  \nBut Beijing pushed back. \nForeign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying denied that China held the key to easing tension on the Korean peninsula and said that duty lay with the parties directly involved. She also reiterated China\xe2\x80\x99s position that sanctions on North Korea are only effective if paired with talks. \nNorth Korea staged its sixth and most powerful nuclear bomb test earlier this month and in July tested long-range intercontinental ballistic missiles capable of reaching at least parts of the U.S. mainland.  \nLast month, North Korea fired an intermediate range missile that also flew over Hokkaido into the ocean.      \nWarning announcements about the latest missile blared around 7 a.m. (2200 GMT Thursday) in parts of northern Japan, while many residents received alerts on their mobile phones or saw warnings on TV telling them to seek refuge. \nThe U.S. military said soon after the launch it had detected a single intermediate range ballistic missile but it did not pose a threat to North America or Guam, which lies 3,400 km (2,110 miles) from North Korea. \nThe missile reached an altitude of about 770 km (480 miles) and flew for about 19 minutes, according to South Korea\xe2\x80\x99s military.  \nOn global markets, shares and other risk assets barely moved and gold fell as traders paid little attention to the latest missile test, shifting their focus to where and when interest rates will go up.  \nU.S. President Donald Trump has promised not to allow North Korea to threaten the United States with a nuclear-tipped missile. \nRussian President Vladimir Putin discussed the launch in a phone call with French President Emanuel Macron and agreed on the need for a diplomatic solution, including through resuming direct talks on North Korea. \nAsked about the prospect for direct talks, a White House spokesman said, \xe2\x80\x9dAs the president and his national security team have repeatedly said, now is not the time to talk to North Korea.\xe2\x80\x9d \nSouth Korean President Moon Jae-in also said dialogue with the North was impossible at this point. He ordered officials to analyze and prepare for possible new North Korean threats, including electromagnetic pulse and biochemical attacks, a spokesman said.                 \nThe United States and South Korea are technically still at war with North Korea because the 1950-53 Korean conflict ended with a truce and not a peace treaty. The North accuses the United States, which has 28,500 troops in South Korea, of planning to invade and regularly threatens to destroy it and its Asian allies.    \nDavid Wright, of the Union of Concerned Scientists, said the latest test had demonstrated North Korea could reach Guam with a Hwasong 12 missile, although it was not known what payload the missile was carrying. \nWright said it would be difficult for North Korea to use the missile to destroy Anderson U.S. Air Force Base in Guam given what is known about its guidance systems, even if the missile was carrying a high-yield warhead.  \n'

aS' Hundreds of protesters poured into St. Louis\xe2\x80\x99 streets and some scuffles broke out as they voiced their anger after a Missouri judge on Friday ruled a white former St. Louis police officer was not guilty of murder in the 2011 shooting of a black man. \nWith the National Guard on standby in case of violence, authorities appealed to protesters to march peacefully in a state where racially charged clashes in the nearby city of Ferguson spawned the Black Lives Matter movement in 2014. \nPolice said a few protesters threw rocks and water bottles, while witnesses and video showed officers used pepper spray on at least five people about a block from the courthouse. About 50 riot police were on hand, blocking a ramp to a nearby highway. \nJason Stockley, 36, was acquitted of first-degree murder for killing Anthony Lamar Smith, 24. The former policeman, who was arrested in May 2016, was accused of planting a gun in Smith\xe2\x80\x99s car but testified he acted in self-defense. \nAfter the verdict, more than 500 protesters marched in downtown St. Louis, chanting \xe2\x80\x9cNo justice, no peace\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cShut it down.\xe2\x80\x9d Some held \xe2\x80\x9cBlack Lives Matter\xe2\x80\x9d signs. \n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sad, I\xe2\x80\x99m hurt, I\xe2\x80\x99m mad,\xe2\x80\x9d the Reverend Clinton Stancil of the Wayman AME Church in St. Louis said by telephone. \xe2\x80\x9cWe haven\xe2\x80\x99t made any progress since Ferguson, that\xe2\x80\x99s clear. Cops can still kill us with impunity.\xe2\x80\x9d \nMayor Lyda Krewson and Governor Eric Greitens, who put the National Guard on standby, appealed for calm. Local schools planned early dismissals and businesses shut down.  \n\xe2\x80\x9cFrustration, anger, hurt, pain, hope and love all intermingle,\xe2\x80\x9d Krewson said in a statement. \xe2\x80\x9cI encourage St. Louisans to show each other compassion.\xe2\x80\x9d \nAl Watkins, an attorney for Smith\xe2\x80\x99s fiancee, Christina Wilson, said his client was appalled by the decision. He said the ruling showed prejudice, pointing to a line where the judge wrote that an \xe2\x80\x9curban heroin dealer\xe2\x80\x9d without a weapon would be an anomaly. \nJudge Timothy Wilson\xe2\x80\x99s highly anticipated ruling was announced more than five weeks after the bench trial ended. \n\xe2\x80\x9cThis court, as a trier of fact, is simply not firmly convinced of defendant\xe2\x80\x99s guilt,\xe2\x80\x9d he wrote in his ruling. \nWilson said prosecutors also asked the court to consider a lesser degree of homicide but they did not prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Stockley\xe2\x80\x99s use of deadly force was not justified in self-defense.  \nStockley\xe2\x80\x99s attorney, Neil Bruntrager, said the ex-officer on Friday was relieved and would seek to rebuild his life. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s been a long road for him,\xe2\x80\x9d Bruntrager said.  \n\xe2\x80\x98THIS AIN\xe2\x80\x98T RIGHT\xe2\x80\x99 \nIn recent years grand juries have declined to charge officers involved in the 2014 fatal shooting of Michael Brown, 18, which set of nights of violent protest in Ferguson, and the choking death of Eric Garner, 43, in New York. Baltimore police officers also were not convicted in the case of Freddie Gray, who died from a broken neck suffered in a police van in 2015. \nBrown\xe2\x80\x99s father, Michael Brown Sr., voiced his frustration after Friday\xe2\x80\x99s verdict. \n\xe2\x80\x9cYou all know this ain\xe2\x80\x99t right and you all continue to do this to us,\xe2\x80\x9d he told a St. Louis Fox television station. \xe2\x80\x9cLike we don\xe2\x80\x99t mean nothing, like we\xe2\x80\x99re rats, trash, dogs in the streets. Right now, I\xe2\x80\x98m praying for my city because my people are tired of this.\xe2\x80\x9d \nProtesters chanted as they marched around downtown, at one point reaching police headquarters before moving on.         \n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you say to people here when they have no faith in the system and these buildings,\xe2\x80\x9d said Kevin Nevels, 50, of St. Louis, pointing to the courthouse.    \nProsecutor Kimberly Gardner said she was disappointed with the verdict and called on protesters to avoid violence. \n\xe2\x80\x9cI understand the verdict has created anger and frustration for many in our community,\xe2\x80\x9d she told reporters at the courthouse. \xe2\x80\x9cI am frustrated as well. Destruction of our community is not the answer.\xe2\x80\x9d \nSmith tried to flee from Stockley on Dec. 20, 2011, following an alleged drug deal, authorities said. During the pursuit, Stockley could be heard saying on an internal police car video he was going to kill Smith, prosecutors said. \nAt Stockley\xe2\x80\x99s direction, the driver of the police car slammed into Smith\xe2\x80\x99s vehicle and they came to a stop, court documents said. Stockley then approached Smith\xe2\x80\x99s car and shot him five times with his service weapon. \nStockley\xe2\x80\x99s lawyers said he fired in self-defense, believing Smith was reaching for a gun. But prosecutors said the only gun recovered from the scene had only Stockley\xe2\x80\x99s DNA on it.  \nStockley waived his right to a jury trial, allowing the judge to decide. He left the St. Louis Metropolitan Police Department in 2013 and was arrested last year. \nSmith\xe2\x80\x99s family settled a lawsuit against the city for $900,000 in 2013, Watkins said. \n'

aS' U.S. lenders in the path of Hurricane Irma scrambled to acquire twice as much cash as usual last week, a surge that left two Federal Reserve branches in Florida working around the clock to meet the demand before floods and power outages struck. \nThe U.S. central bank\xe2\x80\x99s offices in Miami and Jacksonville dispatched a bulked-up fleet of armored vehicles to pay out $2.9 billion to banks and credit unions in the region, twice their weekly average, according to officials overseeing the emergency response in the Atlanta Fed\xe2\x80\x99s district.  \n\xe2\x80\x9cIt absolutely doubled our normal day to day operations,\xe2\x80\x9d Mary Gelpi, director of the district\xe2\x80\x99s cash function office, said from New Orleans. There was no need for cash to be trucked in from outside the state, as was the case for Louisiana after Hurricane Katrina marooned New Orleans in 2005. \nIrma ripped through the U.S. southeast earlier this week, flooding cities and towns and killing at least 32 in Florida. Nearly 2 million U.S. homes and businesses remain without power.   \nWhile the floods did not threaten the Fed\xe2\x80\x99s office just west of Miami, waters did approach the one in downtown Jacksonville though it did not take in water, Gelpi said. A handful of employees at each office stayed overnight as hours were extended to receive, prepare and send out cash orders. \nThere has not yet been a follow-on surge in cash demand, Gelpi said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe saw the peak prior to the storm, and now the lull as people came back online and commerce is re-emerging.\xe2\x80\x9d \nLate last month, Hurricane Harvey caused more havoc for the Fed\xe2\x80\x99s Houston branch, where cash deliveries were halted amid the flooding and emergency shipments were driven in from San Antonio and Dallas. \n'

aS' U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Friday she has begun an investigation into Equifax\xe2\x80\x99s (\n) massive data breach and, along with 11 other Democratic senators, introduced a bill to give consumers the ability to freeze their credit for free. \nWarren, who has built a reputation as a fierce consumer champion, also signaled in a letter to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), the agency she helped create in the wake of the 2007-2009 financial crisis, that it may require extra powers in order to ensure closer federal oversight of credit reporting agencies. \nAlthough securing new powers for the CFPB could be a tough sell in a Republican-dominated Congress, the attention from Senator Warren and the growing public furor over the Equifax data leak could help protect the CFPB from conservative efforts to weaken the agency, said consumer advocates. \n\xe2\x80\x9cIs there a silver lining to this breach? Could this protect the CFPB for a while? Possibly,\xe2\x80\x9d said Karl Frisch, executive director of consumer advocacy group Allied Progress, adding the scandal may convince some Republicans to preserve America\xe2\x80\x99s top consumer watchdog. \nWarren also wrote letters to Equifax and its rival credit monitoring agencies TransUnion (\n) and Experian (\n), federal regulators, and the Government Accountability Office for information to see if new federal legislation was needed to protect consumers. \n\xe2\x80\x9cI am troubled by this attack - described as \xe2\x80\x98one of the largest risks to personally sensitive information in recent years\xe2\x80\x99 - and by the fact that it represents the third recent instance of a data breach of Equifax or its subsidiaries that has endangered American\xe2\x80\x99s personal information,\xe2\x80\x9d she wrote in a letter to Equifax chairman and chief executive Richard Smith. \nWarren, the top Democrat on the Senate Subcommittee for Financial Institutions and Consumer Protection, said the proposed bill would stop companies like Equifax from charging consumers for freezing and unfreezing access to their credit files.\xc2\xa0A credit freeze restricts access to an individual\xe2\x80\x99s credit report, which can stop account fraud when thieves apply for credit using another person\xe2\x80\x99s information. \nEquifax, which creates individual credit reports used by lenders to assess a consumer\xe2\x80\x99s creditworthiness, has come under intense pressure from senators and members of the House in recent days for what has been described as a slow, inadequate and confusing response to the hack. \nInvestors have dumped Equifax\xe2\x80\x99s stock as a result, driving it down 36 percent since the company disclosed the hack on Sept. 7. The company\xe2\x80\x99s shares fell below $93 early on Friday, and were trading near $91 late Friday morning. \nEquifax, which disclosed the breach more than a month after it learned of it on July 29, said at the time that thieves may have stolen the personal information of 143 million Americans in one of the largest hacks ever. \nIn her letters to the regulators, Warren raised questions regarding the overall regulatory framework for credit report agencies, which are not subject to the same levels of intense scrutiny as other consumer finance firms such as mortgage lenders or credit card providers.  \nThe CFPB supervises credit reporting firms\xe2\x80\x99 compliance with consumer protection laws and earlier this year fined Equifax and TransUnion $5.5 million in total for misstating the cost and usefulness of the scores they provide. But the bureau does not directly license or intensively monitor the companies. \nIn her letter to the CFPB, which is under attack by Republicans who believe it is already too powerful, Warren asked if the agency has \xe2\x80\x9cadequate statutory authority to regulate credit reporting agencies and protect consumers\xe2\x80\x9d and solicited the CFPB\xe2\x80\x99s feedback on what other powers it might require to better regulate them. \nAt least three bills were introduced on Thursday in response to the hack. Four Democratic senators, including Ed Markey of Massachusetts, sponsored legislation that would require Equifax and other data brokers be held accountable for errors. \nA spokesperson for the CFPB was not immediately able to provide comment. \n'

aS' U.S. health insurer Anthem Inc (\n) said on Friday it plans to sell Obamacare health plans in 68 cities and counties in Virginia next year, covering the only remaining U.S. counties that are currently without insurers offering the plans. \nAnthem said last month it was exiting the Obamacare market in the state, but reconsidered the move after no other insurer stepped up to cover most of Virginia\xe2\x80\x99s counties. \nThe Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services said earlier this week that 63 counties nationwide could be \xe2\x80\x9cbare counties,\xe2\x80\x9d with no insurers selling the Obamacare plans. It said that 1,472 counties could have only one insurer in 2018. \nInsurers such as UnitedHealth Group Inc (\n), Aetna Inc (\n) and Humana Inc (\n) have exited most of the states where they sold Obamacare plans. They cited uncertainty over the healthcare legislation and whether the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump will maintain subsidies that keep costs down. \nBut other insurers, like Centene Corp (\n), have filled those gaps, expanding into new counties that had lost their coverage options. \nEarlier this week, a spokesperson for Virginia\xe2\x80\x99s insurance regulator said the state was in serious negotiations to bring in an insurer to cover its bare counties.  \nAnthem has said that it is still working with some state regulators on its market participation for next year. \n'

aS' A home-made bomb on a packed rush-hour commuter train in London engulfed a carriage in flames and injured 22 people on Friday in Britain\xe2\x80\x99s fifth major terrorism incident this year, but apparently failed to fully explode. \nPassengers heading into the British capital fled in panic after the blast as the train was about to depart Parsons Green underground station in West London at 8.20 a.m. (0720 GMT). \nSome suffered burns and others were injured in a stampede to escape but health officials said none were thought to be in a serious condition. \n\xe2\x80\x9cWe now assess that this was a detonation of an improvised explosive device,\xe2\x80\x9d Britain\xe2\x80\x99s top counter-terrorism officer Mark Rowley told reporters. \nPolice said a hunt involving hundreds of detectives backed by the intelligence services was underway to find out who was responsible. Rowley declined to say if the suspected bomber had been on the train, saying it was a live investigation. \nBritain\xe2\x80\x99s threat level remained on its second-highest rank of severe following the \xe2\x80\x9ccowardly attack\xe2\x80\x9d intended to cause significant harm, said Prime Minister Theresa May. But she added the threat level would be kept under review. \nPictures taken at the scene showed a slightly-charred white bucket with a supermarket freezer bag on the floor of one train carriage. The bucket, still intact, was in flames and there appeared to be wires coming out of the top. \n\xe2\x80\x9cI was on second carriage from the back. I just heard a kind of whoosh. I looked up and saw the whole carriage engulfed in flames making its way toward me,\xe2\x80\x9d Ola Fayankinnu, who was on the train, told Reuters.     \n\xe2\x80\x9cThere were phones, hats, bags all over the place and when I looked back I saw a bag with flames.\xe2\x80\x9d  \nCharlie Craven said he had just got on the train when the device exploded. \n\xe2\x80\x9cLiterally within three seconds of putting your bag down, the doors just closing, we hear a loud explosion,\xe2\x80\x9d he told Reuters. \xe2\x80\x9cI looked around and saw this massive fireball ... coming down the carriage.\xe2\x80\x9d  \nHe said terrified passengers fled, fearing a second explosion or a gunman, with people being knocked to the ground and crushed in the stampede to escape. \nOutside the station, a woman was carried off on a stretcher with her legs covered in a foil blanket while others were led away swathed in bandages. Health officials said 22 were taken to hospital most suffering from flash burns. \nParsons Green is one of the surface stations of London\xe2\x80\x99s underground network. \n\xe2\x80\x9cSPECULATION UNHELPFUL\xe2\x80\x9d \nIn 2005, 52 people were killed when four British Islamists carried out suicide bomb attacks on three London underground trains and a bus and this year Britain has suffered four attacks which killed a total of 36 people. \n\xe2\x80\x9cAnother attack in London by a loser terrorist,\xe2\x80\x9d U.S. President Donald Trump said on Twitter. \xe2\x80\x9cThese are sick and demented people who were in the sights of Scotland Yard. Must be proactive!\xe2\x80\x9d \nMay, who returned to London to chair a meeting of Britain\xe2\x80\x99s emergency response committee, said police and security services were working to track down those responsible. \nAsked about Trump\xe2\x80\x99s tweet, she replied: \xe2\x80\x9cI never think it\xe2\x80\x99s helpful for anybody to speculate on what is an ongoing investigation.\xe2\x80\x9d  \nOthers were more directly critical of Trump. \xe2\x80\x9cTrue or not - and I\xe2\x80\x98m sure he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t know - this is so unhelpful from leader of our ally and intelligence partner,\xe2\x80\x9d May\xe2\x80\x99s former chief of staff Nick Timothy said on Twitter.  \nA U.S. law enforcement official and a U.S. intelligence source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the attack might well have been carried out in response to recent Islamic State video messages urging would-be militants to attack trains and other public transport. \nOne of the officials said the device \xe2\x80\x9cdoesn\xe2\x80\x99t look very professionally built\xe2\x80\x9d and said its rudimentary design suggested the attack was carried out by someone inspired by Islamic State propaganda rather than by a well-trained cell. \nProfessor Hans Michels, an explosives expert from Imperial College London, said the device appeared to have largely failed.  \n\xe2\x80\x9cThe flash flame reported suggests that the \xe2\x80\x98explosion\xe2\x80\x99 was only partly successful,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI must speculate that either the mixture was not of the right composition or that the ignition system was inadequate or not properly placed.\xe2\x80\x9d   \nUK security services believe those behind some of the militant incidents in Britain this year had probably been acting alone and likely radicalized by online material.   \nIn March this year, a man drove a car into pedestrians on London\xe2\x80\x99s Westminster Bridge killing four, before he stabbed a policeman to death outside parliament.  \nA further 22 people were killed in a suicide bombing at a pop concert in Manchester in May and the following month three Islamist militants drove into pedestrians on London Bridge before stabbing people at nearby restaurants and bars, killing eight. \nIn June, a van was driven into worshippers near a mosque in north London which left one man dead. \nOn Thursday, figures showed there had been a record number of terrorism-related arrests in the last year and earlier this week Britain\xe2\x80\x99s most senior counter-terrorism officer Mark Rowley said there had been a shift-change in the threat. \nIn the three years until March this year, police foiled 13 potential attacks but in the next 17 weeks, there were the four attacks while the authorities thwarted six others, Rowley said. \n'

aS" Sunday\xe2\x80\x99s Primetime Emmy winners will take home shiny trophies and bask in congratulations, but their biggest payoff could come in a call from Netflix Inc (\n) or Amazon.com Inc (\n).  \nIn recent months, the two streaming networks have lured the makers of pioneering shows from broadcast and cable networks with big cash offers and promises of creative freedom. \n\xe2\x80\x9cNetflix, Amazon, Hulu and the like are really putting their money where their mouth is,\xe2\x80\x9d said Melissa Rosenberg, a former writer on Showtime\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cDexter\xe2\x80\x9d who moved to Netflix to create the dark superhero show \xe2\x80\x9cJessica Jones.\xe2\x80\x9d  \n\xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99re paying creators, extraordinary actors, and for the budgets of shows equal or better than basic cable or network TV,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \nSome of television\xe2\x80\x99s biggest names have deserted network and cable for streaming.  \nNetflix enticed Shonda Rhimes away from her longtime home on Walt Disney Co\xe2\x80\x99s (\n) ABC, where she developed hits like \xe2\x80\x9cGrey\xe2\x80\x99s Anatomy\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cScandal.\xe2\x80\x9d It also landed filmmakers Joel and Ethan Coen for a western anthology series after their success with a TV spinoff of their movie \xe2\x80\x9cFargo\xe2\x80\x9d on FX (\n). \nAmazon lured Matthew Weiner, who put AMC on the map with his Emmy award-winning \xe2\x80\x9cMad Men,\xe2\x80\x9d to develop an anthology series called \xe2\x80\x9cThe Romanoffs.\xe2\x80\x9d It also has brought on Robert Kirkman, the man behind the basic cable network\xe2\x80\x99s current most-watched show, \xe2\x80\x9cThe Walking Dead,\xe2\x80\x9d to create new shows.   \nNetflix, which received 91 Emmy nominations this year, has a shot at winning its first best drama series award with supernatural mystery \xe2\x80\x9cStranger Things\xe2\x80\x9d or British royal saga \xe2\x80\x9cThe Crown,\xe2\x80\x9d whose reported $130 million budget is the most expensive TV production ever. \nHulu\xe2\x80\x99s critically acclaimed \xe2\x80\x9cThe Handmaid\xe2\x80\x99s Tale\xe2\x80\x9d could bring the joint venture streaming platform its first major Emmys. \nCable and traditional television are still forces to be reckoned with, though. \n\xe2\x80\x9cTraditional media companies are scrambling, saying: \xe2\x80\x98How do we beat back so much money being thrown at TV?'\xe2\x80\x9d said Peter Csathy, chairman of media and technology advisory firm CREATV Media. \n\xe2\x80\x9cThe challenge is about compelling storytelling and keeping talent amid those forces,\xe2\x80\x9d he added. \nNBC\xe2\x80\x99s family drama \xe2\x80\x9cThis Is Us\xe2\x80\x9d could clinch the first best drama series Emmy for one of the four big U.S. broadcasters since 2006, and the Comcast-owned CMSCA.O network\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cSaturday Night Live\xe2\x80\x9d is expected to take home an armful of trophies. \nHBO (\n), which led the Emmy nominations with 111 nods, and FX have capitalized on the limited-series format that streaming platforms prefer, with shorter seasons, cinematic-style storytelling and A-list talent.  \nHBO\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cBig Little Lies,\xe2\x80\x9d starring Reese Witherspoon and Nicole Kidman, is a front-runner in this category, as is FX\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cFeud,\xe2\x80\x9d which pits Susan Sarandon opposite Jessica Lange.  \nHBO\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cThe Wizard of Lies\xe2\x80\x9d lured Robert De Niro to his first major TV role and Emmy nomination for playing disgraced financier Bernie Madoff. \nOne big attraction for broadcast television defectors is the creative freedom offered by streaming.  \n\xe2\x80\x9cNetwork (TV) is limited by what it can put on air, and it answers to advertisers, so there are a lot of limitations as to how far you can go, whether a character is likeable, edgy, racy,\xe2\x80\x9d said \xe2\x80\x9cJessica Jones\xe2\x80\x9d creator Rosenberg.  \nAnd all the networks are chasing the next \xe2\x80\x9cGame of Thrones,\xe2\x80\x9d HBO\xe2\x80\x99s popular Emmy-winning medieval fantasy series, which has become the pinnacle of prestige TV.   \n\xe2\x80\x9cEveryone is looking for a tent-pole show so that they can scream loud and proud to bring audiences and keep them there,\xe2\x80\x9d CREATV\xe2\x80\x99s Csathy said.   \n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Game of Thrones\xe2\x80\x99 is a poster child for breaking the rules in terms of storytelling and killing off lead characters with reckless abandon,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s something we traditionally have not seen in television.\xe2\x80\x9d \n"

aS' As the U.S. Congress moves quickly to pass the first federal law governing self-driving cars, some state and city officials are pushing back over fears that the measure will limit their ability to regulate vehicle safety at the local level. \nThe debate highlights the challenges of rolling out a new technology that does not fit neatly into an existing regulatory framework. States traditionally regulate the driver while the federal government regulates the car, but that division of labor may be hard to maintain when cars have no drivers. \nIndustry officials say a single, nationwide set of standards would speed the development of self-driving vehicle technology, ultimately lead to fewer highway deaths, and keep the United States in the forefront of automotive technology.     \nThe U.S. House of Representatives unanimously approved the sweeping bill last week, and U.S. Senator John Thune said on Wednesday he wanted to move the bill out of committee by early October. \nThe federal bill bars states and cities from implementing \xe2\x80\x9cunreasonable restrictions\xe2\x80\x9d on the rollout of self-driving cars. Critics say the vague language could lead the industry to sue states over any regulations they consider overly burdensome. \n\xe2\x80\x9cIf Congress preempts state and local governments from enacting smart safety protections, the adoption of this amazing technology could be unnecessarily delayed by court challenges and state legislative action,\xe2\x80\x9d said Leah Treat, director of the transportation bureau in Portland, Oregon, which is set to enact its own self-driving regulations by the end of the year.  \nIn a Sept. 5 letter to U.S. congressional leaders, the National Governors Association, the National Conference of State Legislators and other groups said the federal rules encroached on state authority and urged federal lawmakers to change the bill\xe2\x80\x99s language. \nThe new measure authorizes manufacturers to put 25,000 self-driving cars on the road in the next year for testing. Those numbers would gradually increase, with a total of 275,000 vehicles permitted by 2021.  \nCritics of the federal bill said they generally support the development of self-driving technology but felt neglected and overruled by federal legislators. \n\xe2\x80\x9cCalifornia, for example, has higher emission standards,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jennifer Cohen, government affairs director for the Los Angeles Department of Transportation. \xe2\x80\x9cDoes the federal preemption preclude us from enforcing these? Can we still protect our school zones?\xe2\x80\x9d \nThough fully-autonomous cars are still years away from widespread adoption, 25 states have already passed legislation or issued executive orders related to autonomous vehicles, according to the National Conference of State Legislators. \nNew York, for example, has taken a strict approach to testing, requiring self-driving cars to follow an approved route with a police escort. The state also has a law that requires drivers to have at least one hand on the wheel of any car, though it was suspended until April 2018 to accommodate autonomous vehicle testing. \nData-sharing is also a major flashpoint. Pittsburgh Mayor Bill Peduto said earlier this year he was disappointed Uber, which is testing a fleet of autonomous vehicles there, has been hesitant to share data the city could use to improve traffic flow and infrastructure.  \nUber said it would share some data starting this year on a voluntary basis, but Chan Lieu, a former director of governmental affairs at NHTSA who is now an advisor to the Self-Driving Coalition for Safer Streets, which includes Ford, Alphabet\xe2\x80\x99s Waymo, Volvo Cars, Uber [UBER.UL] and Lyft, said the companies would oppose broad data disclosure requirements. \nThere are privacy concerns, he said, as well as commercial fears of revealing trade secrets. \nCalifornia currently requires the industry to hand over data on vehicle disengagements and collisions, and the National Association of City Transportation Officials has called for the federal government to adopt similar requirements. \nNot all states are concerned about the federal bill. Arizona governor Douglas Ducey issued a 2015 executive order saying his state supported the self-driving industry and hoped the technology would bring new jobs to the state. \nArizona does not currently impose any restrictions on self-driving cars. Kevin Biesty, the deputy director for policy at Arizona\xe2\x80\x99s department for transportation, said the state largely trusted automakers to adapt their technology as concerns arise. \n\xe2\x80\x9cOne of the reasons we did not step forward and regulate is because the industry is changing so fast and what you release today might become obsolete in six months,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \n'

aS'I haven\xe2\x80\x99t yet read Hillary Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cWhat Happened,\xe2\x80\x9d but it seems pretty clear to me what did, in fact, happen in 2016.\nThese days, America starts from a baseline of extreme tribalism: 47 or 48 percent of the electorate will vote for any Republican, no matter how terrible, and against any Democrat, no matter how good. This means, in turn, that small things \xe2\x80\x94 journalists acting like mean kids in high school, ganging up on candidates they consider uncool, events that suggest fresh scandal even when there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing there \xe2\x80\x94 can tip the balance in favor of even the worst candidate imaginable.\nAnd, crucially, last year far too many people were complacent; they assumed that Trump couldn\xe2\x80\x99t possibly become president, so they felt free to engage in trivial pursuits. Then they woke up to find that the inconceivable had happened.\nIs something similar about to go down with health care?\nRepublican attempts to destroy Obamacare have repeatedly failed, and for very good reason. Their attacks on the Affordable Care Act were always based on lies, and they have never come up with a decent alternative.\nThe simple fact is that all the major elements of the A.C.A. \xe2\x80\x94 prohibiting discrimination by insurers based on medical history, requiring that people buy insurance even if they\xe2\x80\x99re currently healthy, premium subsidies and Medicaid expansion that make insurance affordable even for those with lower incomes \xe2\x80\x94 are there because they\xe2\x80\x99re necessary. Yet every plan Republicans have offered would do away with or undermine those key elements, causing tens of millions of Americans to lose health insurance, with the heaviest burden falling on the most vulnerable.\nAll this should be clear to everyone by now. So you might be tempted to assume that no plan along these lines can possibly pass, let alone one that, if anything, looks worse than what we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen so far. But it\xe2\x80\x99s precisely because so many people assume that the threat is behind us, and have turned their attention elsewhere, that health care is once again in danger.\nThe sponsors of the Graham-Cassidy bill now working its way toward a Senate vote claim to be offering \n that preserves the good things about Obamacare. In other words, they are maintaining the G.O.P. norm of lying both about the content of Obamacare and about what would replace it.\nIn reality, Graham-Cassidy is the opposite of moderate. It contains, in exaggerated and almost caricature form, \n that made previous Republican proposals so cruel and destructive. It would eliminate the individual mandate, undermine if not effectively eliminate protection for people with \n, and \n for subsidies and Medicaid. There are a few additional twists, but they\xe2\x80\x99re all bad \xe2\x80\x94 notably, a funding formula that would penalize states that are actually successful in reducing the number of uninsured.\nDid this bill\xe2\x80\x99s sponsors \xe2\x80\x94 Lindsey Graham, Bill Cassidy, Ron Johnson and Dean Heller \xe2\x80\x94 manage to get through months of health care debate without learning anything about the issue? Maybe. But surely the rest of the Senate, not to mention much of the public, has wised up about false Republican promises. A huge majority of voters, almost two to one, consider it a \n that previous attempts at repealing and replacing Obamacare failed.\nYet there is a real chance that Graham-Cassidy, which is similar to but even worse than previous Republican proposals, will nonetheless become law, because not enough people are taking it seriously.\nAs in the presidential election, we start from a baseline of extreme tribalism, in which 48 or 49 Republican senators will vote for anything, no matter how awful, that bears their party\xe2\x80\x99s seal of approval. To make a bill the law, its sponsors only need to win one or two more votes.\nThe main reason Republican leaders couldn\xe2\x80\x99t do that on previous health bills was public outrage and activism. Letters and phone calls, demonstrators and crowds at town halls, made it clear that many Americans were aware of the stakes, and that politicians who voted to take health care away from millions would be held accountable.\nNow, however, the news cycle has moved on, taking public attention with it. Many progressives have already begun taking Obamacare\xe2\x80\x99s achievements for granted, and are moving on from protest against right-wing schemes to dreams of single-payer. Unfortunately, that\xe2\x80\x99s exactly the kind of environment in which swing senators, no longer in the spotlight, might be bribed or bullied into voting for a truly terrible bill.\nThe good news is that for technical reasons of parliamentary procedure, Graham-Cassidy has to pass by the end of this month, or not at all. The bad news is that such passage is a real possibility.\nSo if you care about preserving the huge gains the A.C.A. has brought, make your voice heard. Otherwise we may wake up to another terrible morning after.\n'

aS'That was only one in \n on Sept. 11 by ESPN host Jemele Hill in which Hill goes on to say that Trump is \xe2\x80\x9cthe most ignorant, offensive president of my lifetime,\xe2\x80\x9d that he hired and courted white supremacists, that \xe2\x80\x9cHis rise is a direct result of white supremacy,\xe2\x80\x9d that \xe2\x80\x9cif he were not white, he never would have been elected.\xe2\x80\x9d Hill insinuates that the Republican Party \xe2\x80\x9chas done nothing but endorse/promote white supremacy.\xe2\x80\x9d\nThese tweets caused quite a stir. The White House perpetual lie-generator and press secretary, \n, said that it was a fireable offense for ESPN. Sanders\xe2\x80\x99s statement, of course, was not without its own controversy. As \n:\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe Democratic Coalition, an anti-Trump Super PAC, has filed an ethics complaint against White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders with the Office of Government Ethics for her comments calling on ESPN host Jemele Hill to be fired.\xe2\x80\x9d\nAOL continued:\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe group claims federal law prohibits government employees from influencing \xe2\x80\x98a private entity\xe2\x80\x99s employment \xe2\x80\xa6 solely on the basis of partisan political affiliation.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\nThen on Friday, Trump himself weighed in, because obviously there are no more pressing matters that need his attention, oh like, say, North Korea continuing to launch missiles over Japan, for one.\nTrump tweeted:\n\xe2\x80\x9cESPN is paying a really big price for its politics (and bad programming). People are dumping it in RECORD numbers. Apologize for untruth!\xe2\x80\x9d\nThis tweet, for me, changed the conversation. It moved the discussion from propriety and in-house rules of conduct by a brand, to a question of veracity. Was what Hill said untrue, as Trump\xe2\x80\x99s tweet suggests, or is Trump in fact a white supremacist who has surrounded himself with white supremacists and whose party courted white supremacists?\nTwo of those points can be quickly put to rest. First, there is no question that Trump has hired someone who was at least a booster of white supremacists: Steve Bannon. In a sinister act of double signaling, Bannon was hired as the Trump campaign\xe2\x80\x99s chief executive on the same day that Trump started \n to black voters in Milwaukee.\nAlso, while the Republican Party clearly stands for more than white supremacy and the promotion of that intellectually fallacious concept, the party has often turned a blind eye to the racists in its midst and done far too little to extricate them.\nBut then the question remains: Is Trump himself a white supremacist?\nThis question is almost unanswerable in the absolute, but there is mounting circumstantial evidence pointing in a most disquieting direction.\nFirst, we must submit that Trump is not particularly discerning in the administration of his insults. As \n pointed out in July, \xe2\x80\x9cTrump is on track to insult 650 people, places and things on Twitter by the end of his first term.\xe2\x80\x9d He is often reflexive with his derisions, attacking those who criticize or condemn him. Many of Trump\xe2\x80\x99s lackeys laud his instinct to counterpunch. When Trump attacked MSNBC host Mika Brzezinski, \n, \xe2\x80\x9cWhen the president gets hit, he\xe2\x80\x99s going to hit back harder.\xe2\x80\x9d\nThey paint it as strength, although it is clearly weakness. It is a masking of fragility with aggression. And the traditionally marginalized \xe2\x80\x94 women, racial, religious and ethnic minorities \xe2\x80\x94 are treated to a particularly personal strain of Trump\xe2\x80\x99s venom. In Trump\xe2\x80\x99s eyes, Barack Obama wasn\xe2\x80\x99t simply a bad president, he was illegitimate and inferior, a person who couldn\xe2\x80\x99t possibly be as talented as the world thought he was. He questioned whether Obama had actually attended his prestigious colleges and insisted that Obama\xe2\x80\x99s memoir was \n for him to have written it, that it must have been written by a white man.\nIs Trump patriarchal and misogynistic? Definitely. But, what of white supremacy?\nIt is clear that Trump is hero among white supremacists: He panders to them, he is slow to condemn them and when that condemnation manifests, it is often forced and tepid. Trump never seems to be worried about offending anyone except Vladimir Putin and white supremacists.\nWhat does that say about him? How can you take comfort among and make common cause with white supremacists and not assimilate to their sensibilities?\nI say that it can\xe2\x80\x99t be done. If you are not completely opposed to white supremacy, you are quietly supporting it. If you continue to draw equivalencies between white supremacists and the people who oppose them \xe2\x80\x94 as Trump did \n last week \xe2\x80\x94 you have crossed the racial Rubicon and moved beyond quiet support to vocal support. You have made an allegiance and dug a trench in the war of racial hostilities.\nHill may have pushed into the realm of hyperbole with a few of her statements \xe2\x80\x94 it was Twitter after all \xe2\x80\x94 but I judge the spirit of her assessment to be true.\nEither Trump is himself a white supremacist or he is a fan and defender of white supremacists, and I quite honestly am unable to separate the two designations.\n'

aS'For Major League Baseball, 2017 has been a season of extremes. The Los Angeles Dodgers went on an extraordinary tear, winning 84 percent of the time during one 67-game stretch. Then they pulled a U-ie and lost all but one of their next 17 games. The Cleveland Indians entered the weekend Friday night having triumphed in 22 straight games, an American League record.\nMuch of the baseball world\xe2\x80\x99s attention, though, is on a single player: \n, who plays right field for the Miami Marlins. He has been hitting home runs at a pace worthy of Roy Hobbs in \xe2\x80\x9cThe Natural\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 54 of them going into the weekend. That has put him at the center of intriguing debates among the sport\xe2\x80\x99s devotees.\nIf there\xe2\x80\x99s one thing that die-hard fans love more than baseball, it\xe2\x80\x99s arguing about baseball. The question about Mr. Stanton is what to do should he hit 62 homers, a challenging goal with only two weeks left in the regular season but one nonetheless within sight. He would top an old record of 61 established in 1961 by Roger Maris, who surpassed the 60 that Babe Ruth hit in 1927.\nHang on, you may be saying. Isn\xe2\x80\x99t the real record well out of reach \xe2\x80\x94 the 73 homers that Barry Bonds hit in 2001? That is so. But Mr. Bonds has long labored under suspicions that he sailed to his 73 on a tide of performance-enhancing drugs. A similar taint clings to Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa, both of whom also outdid Maris in the steroid-fueled 1990s and early 2000s.\nSo an argument heard in some baseball-watching circles is that if Mr. Stanton hits 62, he deserves to be recognized as the real record-holder \xe2\x80\x94 a man who, like Maris, is unsullied by intimations of skulduggery.\nTime now for another favorite pastime of baseball fans: whataboutery.\nWhat about the fact that ballparks are smaller today and thus cozier for power hitters than they used to be? Oh yeah, what about Maris hitting his 61 in a longer season than Ruth had, and at a time when pitching strength was diluted by major league expansion? Oh yeah, what about Ruth having it easier because he never had to face great pitchers like Satchel Paige or Bob Gibson because blacks couldn\xe2\x80\x99t play in the big leagues then?\nThe barroom quarreling can go on and on (and often does). To add my two cents, no one has ever doubted the integrity, and the majesty, of Hank Aaron, who held the career record of 755 home runs until Mr. Bonds slipped past him with 762.\nAs for Babe Ruth and his single-season 60 dingers, let\xe2\x80\x99s simply note that he was a fellow of prodigious appetites. He hit a lot of high balls, and drank a lot of highballs. How can you not admire someone who accomplished so much while under the influence of performance-\ndrugs?\n'

aS'Steve Bannon, the former presidential confidante, was as apocalyptic as ever about China on the eve of his trip to Hong Kong. The man who had all but declared \xe2\x80\x9ceconomic war\xe2\x80\x9d with China in earlier interviews \n, \xe2\x80\x9cA hundred years from now, this is what they\xe2\x80\x99ll remember \xe2\x80\x94 what we did to confront China on its rise to world domination.\xe2\x80\x9d On arrival, \n to a big investor conference, he seemed to have softened a bit, praising China\xe2\x80\x99s leadership and offering hopes that a trade war could be averted.\nMr. Bannon reflects a basic tension in the Trump administration: whether to challenge China (and if so, where and when) or work with it. There is, on the one hand, huge resentment toward Beijing \xe2\x80\x94 which Mr. Bannon shares \xe2\x80\x94 among those who believe that China has grown its economy at the expense of the working and middle classes. (The focus of his speech was instructive: \xe2\x80\x9cAmerican economic nationalism and the populist revolt and Asia,\xe2\x80\x9d the three intertwined in his mind.) And then there are those who believe that without China\xe2\x80\x99s help there can be no serious deterrent to North Korea (which \n last week), no lasting stability in the South China Sea and the Asian rim as a whole.\nThis much is true: For the foreseeable future, no relationship is more crucial than that between these two nations. Together, they have a combined population of more than 1.7 billion people. Their economies dwarf all others, they both have nuclear weapons, they both have veto power in the United Nations Security Council. Their appetites and ambitions shape the globe: Together they can make for a more peaceful world; as adversaries, they can make a mess of things.\nTo some extent, President Trump seems to understand all that. He engaged early with President Xi Jinping, at his Mar-a-Lago resort, and has sought to \n, including a recent exchange that the president described as a \xe2\x80\x9cvery strong phone call.\xe2\x80\x9d Yet, at the same time, he has failed to articulate a coherent strategy toward China or to achieve significant progress on the many consequential issues. He seems also to lump all China-related issues into one big, menacing ball \xe2\x80\x94 trade, tariffs, North Korea \xe2\x80\x94 rather than dealing with them separately, and this has added more complications.\nAdditionally, the administration has been slow to get China experts into senior posts at the White House and State Department; for good or ill, Mr. Bannon was one person with Mr. Trump\xe2\x80\x99s ear who took a big interest in China. Now there is no senior person with close ties to the president to oversee China policy, which does little to foster a consistent policy or reflect well on American leadership.\nAgainst Mr. Trump\xe2\x80\x99s impulsiveness and his espousal of an America First agenda of isolationism and protectionism, Mr. Xi projects a steady hand as he tries to remake the global economic and political order and entice nations into Beijing\xe2\x80\x99s orbit.\nChinese trade is undeniably a big draw for many countries. So is Mr. Xi\xe2\x80\x99s promised, though perhaps quixotic, $1 trillion investment in \n, an ambitious network of trading routes and development projects \xe2\x80\x94 roads, ports, pipelines and the like from China to Africa and Europe \xe2\x80\x94 that seems also to have drawn Mr. Bannon\xe2\x80\x99s admiration. Having long operated quietly in Russia\xe2\x80\x99s shadow at the United Nations, the Chinese are also speaking out more forcefully and engaging more robustly across multiple regions, a trend that has accelerated under Mr. Trump.\nMeanwhile, Mr. Trump, unlike his predecessor, Barack Obama, who worked to expand American influence in Asia, has ceded significant ground to China, especially by withdrawing from the 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership and thus allowing Beijing an opening to set trade rules in the region. The American president will share the world stage with Mr. Xi for the first time this week when both men address the annual United Nations General Assembly.\nCan there be robust cooperation? In 2005, when President George W. Bush was in office, Robert Zoellick, then a deputy secretary of state, encouraged China to become a \xe2\x80\x9cresponsible stakeholder\xe2\x80\x9d and help strengthen the Western-designed postwar international system from which it benefited. Yet today more officials and experts are putting China in the adversary category, or leaning toward doing so, not least because of Beijing\xe2\x80\x99s decision to expand its military capability and project it further into the South China Sea.\nStill, to anyone who steps back from the immediate conflicts over territory and trade, there is no alternative to cooperation on major challenges, even if interests aren\xe2\x80\x99t always aligned. Mr. Trump is supposed to make his first presidential trip to Beijing in November, and Mr. Xi will certainly want to demonstrate that he can work with and manage the mercurial American president. The meeting is a natural forcing mechanism for getting some things done.\nHere\xe2\x80\x99s one thing that is not much talked about: counterterrorism. Mr. Trump worries about the Islamic State, Mr. Xi about Muslim Uighurs in China\xe2\x80\x99s northwestern region of Xinjiang. Beijing could benefit from American intelligence about militants returning from the Middle East to Xinjiang; Washington would be interested in China\xe2\x80\x99s help in persuading Pakistan to crack down on the Taliban.\nOn trade, there may be an opportunity for progress on a bilateral investment treaty, with American investment offered in exchange for broader access to the Chinese market for American companies. On intellectual property, now that China is putting energy into developing its own technology instead of just stealing America\xe2\x80\x99s, the two could work together on stronger protections.\nAnd then, of course, there is North Korea. Mr. Trump has insisted far more strongly than Mr. Obama that China, as the North\xe2\x80\x99s main supplier of food and fuel, could single-handedly resolve the North Korea nuclear crisis if it wanted to. China can do a lot, and it did support the United States in \n last week. But it has no interest in seeing North Korea collapse, and doubts remain about whether it could force the North to negotiate.\nThere is a template for cooperation, and while it involves an issue in which Mr. Trump has no interest, it provides a glimpse of a way forward. The issue is climate change. A combination of arduous negotiation by Secretary of State John Kerry and the Obama White House, plus China\xe2\x80\x99s own horrible air pollution problems, brought Beijing around to signing the Paris accord and making a major commitment to stabilize greenhouse gas emissions. Self-interest and patient diplomacy: a combination that could work to the benefit of the entire world.\n'

aS'This week President Trump \n to enshrine into law protections for young illegal immigrants brought to the United States as children. Within a matter of days, these young people went from fearing deportation to homelands some had never known, to having a potential shot at citizenship.\nDid this mark the arrival of a new, compassionate, capable Donald Trump?\nSadly, probably not. Mr. Trump\xe2\x80\x99s actions are rarely underpinned by principles, or a vision of who we are as a nation. Even on matters of near-perfect moral clarity, he is often transactional and capricious. If he does the right thing, there must be an angle.\nHis word is never final; it\xe2\x80\x99s only the latest in a never-ending set of tactical adjustments made with one eye on his poll numbers, and the other on Fox News. If it benefits Mr. Trump personally to renege on this week\xe2\x80\x99s \n with Democrats and woo xenophobes and bigots instead of reviving the \xe2\x80\x9cDream Act,\xe2\x80\x9d he will.\nIf his core supporters thought his sympathy for Dreamers was evidence that he was getting wobbly on immigration, he made clear they could still count on his sympathy for racists. Soon after \n, the Senate\xe2\x80\x99s lone black Republican, privately scolded him for his \xe2\x80\x9csterile\xe2\x80\x9d response to \xe2\x80\x9chate groups who over three centuries of this country\xe2\x80\x99s history have made it their mission to create upheaval in minority communities,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Trump once again asserted what he saw as an \n who marched in Charlottesville, Va., and those who aggressively opposed them. And while he did sign a c\n denouncing these hate groups, his refusal to unequivocally reject them is what led to the unanimously approved measure to begin with.\nIt was Mr. Trump, too, who had placed those young immigrants in jeopardy of deportation last week, when he had his attorney general, Jeff Sessions, \n to President Barack Obama\xe2\x80\x99s five-year-old executive order \xe2\x80\x94 Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals \xe2\x80\x94 which let them live, work and go to school in the United States. Almost immediately after Mr. Sessions denounced these \xe2\x80\x9cDreamers\xe2\x80\x9d as job-stealers and potential gang members, Mr. Trump seemed to shift, amid a wave of outrage at the administration\xe2\x80\x99s cruelty.\nOn Wednesday night, Mr. Trump had dinner with Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic leaders of the Senate and House, who later \n that the president had agreed to their proposal \xe2\x80\x9cto enshrine the protections of DACA into law quickly,\xe2\x80\x9d along with border security measures, but no border wall.\nWhat followed the next day was the now familiar ping-ponging of tweets and contradictory assertions from Mr. Trump and others that threw Congress into chaos, as Republicans tried to parse what the president meant. There would be a path to citizenship, or there would be no such path? The wall was being built, or the wall would be built later?\nConservatives erupted. Ann Coulter, author of \xe2\x80\x9cIn Trump We Trust,\xe2\x80\x9d unleashed a stream of protests, demanding that he be impeached.\nOf course, Mr. Trump always saw the wall as more of a campaign slogan than a possibility. Even congressional Republicans are balking at handing him billions for a quixotic project that won\xe2\x80\x99t be completed for years, if ever.\nAmid Thursday\xe2\x80\x99s uproar, the conservative Never-Trump stalwart William Kristol had sound advice on dealing with Mr. Trump.\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo liberals, centrists & conservatives,\xe2\x80\x9d he \n, \xe2\x80\x9cwork for good policies during Trump\xe2\x80\x99s presidency; never lose sight of his unfitness to be president.\xe2\x80\x9d\nNo one should cheer Mr. Trump\xe2\x80\x99s latest moves as a pivot toward principles. So far, his main operating principle seems to be service to himself.\n'

aS'CONCORD, Calif. \xe2\x80\x94 Brazil\xe2\x80\x99s interim president, Michel Temer, is willing to sacrifice millions of acres of rain forest in pursuit of a 16th-century boondoggle: fortunes of gold in the Amazon.\nIn August, Mr. Temer signed a decree to \n \xe2\x80\x94 an area larger than Denmark \xe2\x80\x94 to commercial mining, threatening decades of progress on environmental protection and indigenous rights in the Amazon. The approximately 17,800-square-mile National Reserve of Copper and Associates, or Renca, which straddles the northern states of Par\xc3\xa1 and Amap\xc3\xa1, was created by Brazil\xe2\x80\x99s military dictatorship in 1984 to guard mineral resources from foreign exploitation as the country staggered toward democracy.\nToday the reserve is a patchwork of conservation areas and indigenous lands. Its protected status has deterred the runaway development rampant elsewhere in the Amazon that has squelched biodiversity, destroyed indigenous communities and reduced millions of acres of rain forest to pastureland.\nDuring Brazil\xe2\x80\x99s last gold rush, in the 1980s, thousands of Yanomami people lost their land \xe2\x80\x94 and their lives \xe2\x80\x94 to the government-sponsored invasion of \xe2\x80\x9cgarimpeiros\xe2\x80\x9d (prospectors) who exposed tribes to disease, alcohol, drugs and prostitution. \n the suspected slaughter of more than 10 members of an isolated tribe on the border with Per\xc3\xba by miners who boasted at a bar of cutting up the dead, including women and children, and disposing of their remains in the river.\nLike his counterpart in the United States, Donald Trump, Mr. Temer treats environmental regulations like red tape. By opening roughly 30 percent of Renca to mining exploration, the decree sets a dangerous precedent by dissolving a longstanding federal barrier to development, leaving other protected areas within and beyond the reserve exposed to potential to research and exploration. Randolfe Rodrigues, an opposition senator from Amap\xc3\xa1 State, called the decree \xe2\x80\x9cthe biggest attack on the Amazon of the last 50 years.\xe2\x80\x9d\nFor decades, Brazilian policy makers have looked at the rain forest as a source of future mineral, timber, oil and agricultural wealth, and little in the country\xe2\x80\x99s history suggests that the government can steward sustainable development in the planet\xe2\x80\x99s largest forest and watershed.\n, the \n project cut a 2,500-mile-long road across the Amazon Basin, promising to open the unexplored interior to settlement. Thousands of indigenous people were killed or forced to move, few settlers heard the call, and generations later the route is a largely unpaved thread connecting small towns with few economic opportunities.\nAnother project from the twilight of the military regime, the \n, was resurrected in this century as a solution to Brazil\xe2\x80\x99s energy woes. The megaproject redirected the flow of one of the Amazon\xe2\x80\x99s largest tributaries to generate energy for development and mining projects, displacing thousands of indigenous people and other residents in the path of the floodwaters. Tribes in the area protested vigorously for years, only to be pacified with emergency aid programs so poorly managed that a federal prosecutor charged the government with \xe2\x80\x9cethnocide.\xe2\x80\x9d\nIn the years since Renca was established, ranchers throughout the Amazon have slashed and burned their way deeper into the forest with impunity. The Amazon frontier has become a South American Wild West where land barons feud over property, extort judges and politicians with threats of violence, and abuse workers in conditions akin to slavery. Over time, a powerful lobby of ranchers, loggers, land speculators and mining companies has consolidated its political power, forming a pivotal congressional bloc \xe2\x80\x94 the ruralistas \xe2\x80\x94 who recently intervened to shield Mr. Temer from a federal corruption investigation.\nMr. Temer is asking Brazilians to forget that history and trust in assurances that mining in Renca won\xe2\x80\x99t harm the environment and indigenous people, but mine operators\xe2\x80\x99 records in places like Minas Gerais State do not inspire confidence. In 2015, Brazil suffered what is regarded as \n when an iron ore tailings dam in Minas Gerais failed, killing 17 people and poisoning the region\xe2\x80\x99s most important river with tons of toxic orange sludge that will take years to clean.\nLarge-scale mining efforts are even riskier in the Amazon where so-called greenfield projects require the construction of roads, railways and hydroelectric dams that worsen deforestation, pollute the water supply and destroy plant and animal life. According to data collected by the \n, a scientific organization working for the sustainable development of the Amazon, Renca is home to one of the highest concentrations of endangered mammals in the rain forest.\nAccording to Mr. Temer, though, \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s no paradise.\xe2\x80\x9d His administration is quick to point to the presence of illegal loggers and miners in the reserve who are \xe2\x80\x9cplundering the nation\xe2\x80\x99s wealth\xe2\x80\x9d and polluting the water supply with mercury. They claim that legal operations will push out prospectors, but history shows that prospectors will be drawn like mosquitoes to the allure of fresh veins.\n, a group of Catholic clergy members in the region, calls the decree \xe2\x80\x9ca blasphemy of Brazilian democracy,\xe2\x80\x9d warning against \xe2\x80\x9cincreased land conflicts, uncontrolled aggression against cultures and lifestyles of indigenous and traditional communities, with large tax exemptions but minimum benefits for the people of the region.\xe2\x80\x9d\nResponding to worldwide outcry, the Temer administration tried to make its decree more palatable, but a \n, saying the move would require congressional approval. Now the proposal is open for public comment. Unfortunately the decree is but one of many attacks on environmental regulations in Brazil.\nThree current bills under consideration could open more than 12 million acres (five million hectares) of protected forest over the next eight years. Mr. Temer has proposed a new mining code that shifts the responsibility for monitoring environmental standards away from the government and toward the companies themselves. Another catastrophic proposal would \n within Brazil\xe2\x80\x99s protected border zone \xe2\x80\x94 a territory the size of Alaska \xe2\x80\x94 to foreign mining investment, bringing bulldozers and new waves of prospectors to the refuge of some of the world\xe2\x80\x99s last isolated tribes.\nThe Amazon is a natural wonder enshrined in the Brazilian Constitution as part of the national patrimony. Its future is critical to Brazil, South America and the planet. It is also a region in chaos where local, state and federal governments struggle to deliver basic health and sanitation services, let alone regulate international mining operations.\nIf Mr. Temer wants to stimulate economic development in the region, he should solicit foreign investors to repair and expand its public infrastructure so that the Amazon and its people can live up to their remarkable potential in fields like biotechnology, health care and sustainable fishing and agriculture. To accelerate mining in the Amazon in 2017 would only refresh the cycle of pillage, boom and bust that has plagued the world\xe2\x80\x99s largest forest since the first marauders arrived in search of El Dorado.\n'

aS'Brazil, a nation rich in natural resources, fertile lands and cultural diversity, has struggled for decades with underdevelopment. Some blame it on the \xe2\x80\x9ccusto Brasil,\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cBrazil cost\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 the accumulated price, in cash, time and other resources, of doing business here \xe2\x80\x94 pointing to the weight of bureaucracy, high taxes and poor investment. Others cite insufficient investments in infrastructure, science, technology and education.\nThe root cause of our struggle, however, is a decay of democracy in the face of systemic, institutional corruption. Our representative system has been so far removed from its raison d\xe2\x80\x99\xc3\xaatre that the will to govern has been replaced by the goal of remaining in power.\nNothing better illustrates the complex web of Brazil\xe2\x80\x99s democratic decay than \n, the wide-ranging investigation into corruption.\nOur governmental structure is coalition-based, which makes it vulnerable to corruption. With dozens of parties vying to form a majority in Congress, elections are bloated and prohibitively expensive. Gaining power allows a political party the chance to appoint executives at state-run companies. Executives receive kickbacks from contractors, and some of that cash is funneled back to the party.\nIt is a self-perpetuating cycle: Fraudulent elections generate public administrations that promote corruption, and are operated by politicians who create electoral reforms to grant themselves more and more power, resources and control. As a result, Brazil\xe2\x80\x99s main political parties, which have taken uninterrupted turns in authority for decades, are focused not on governing the country, but on building alliances to stay in power.\nMinisters, advisers, senators, representatives and even members of the judicial branch collaborate with private interests to make decisions about public investments and push for the approval of bills that disproportionately benefit those in power.\nSome of Brazil\xe2\x80\x99s largest economic groups are, in fact, artificial empires built on tax exemptions and loans from the Brazilian Development Bank, and their failures have shaken the foundations of the country\xe2\x80\x99s economy.\nDevelopment resources intended to improve quality of life and reduce social inequality have been drained to enrich certain groups and companies that have been hailed as \xe2\x80\x9cnational champions,\xe2\x80\x9d and to finance the political party system. Through misguided economic policy and the misappropriation of public resources, they have cost more than 14 million people their jobs.\nEven President Michel Temer, whose agenda eschews the public interest and puts our natural resources at risk, was recently charged with bribery and is \n potential investigations into his operations. At the end of August he \n 11 million acres of a preserve in the Amazon \xe2\x80\x94 about the size of Denmark \xe2\x80\x94 so the land could be opened to mining. This will further encourage deforestation, the loss of water resources and violence against local communities and indigenous peoples.\nBut operation Car Wash has shown that we can punish politicians and executives for their crimes. The investigation has been integral in exposing the corruption that permeates our country, revealing billions of dollars in illegal payments, jailing executives and bringing a \n on charges of violating campaign finance laws. It has inaugurated an era in which corrupt businessmen and politicians will fear justice because they know that imprisonment may indeed be in their future. The operation gives us a glimpse of a possible political future for the country \xe2\x80\x94 one that is less conformist, has a high regard for the values of citizenship and demands equality for all.\nOperation Car Wash also serves as a warning for the business sector and its deep-rooted practice of influencing government decisions. Businesses engaged in corruption can now be dealt with by the justice system, which will free us up to create an environment in which competition can promote efficiency and adequate public works and services.\nThis tsunami sweeping Brazil will allow space for a new political paradigm founded on the principle that justice means justice for all. We\xe2\x80\x99re not there yet, but operation Car Wash is working, as evidenced by the reaction of the political establishment along the entire ideological spectrum.\nA significant number of political, party and business leaders are using all their assets to keep things as they are. There are alliances between former opponents aimed at stopping the investigation, and there are attempts to impose rules for the 2018 general election that would guarantee continuity for those currently in power. Operation Car Wash\xe2\x80\x99s main task force was even shut down in July, leaving the investigation to be absorbed by a larger anti-corruption division with a more limited scope.\nOur hope of seeing Brazil rejuvenated remains in the hands of the press, the judicial branch and the people. With a lot of pain, we are learning how to create effective laws and institutions. The first big test will be the 2018 elections, when voters will be able to conduct the biggest \xe2\x80\x9cwash\xe2\x80\x9d ever seen in Brazilian politics \xe2\x80\x94 when they will have a chance to clean out corruption and open the door to a reconstruction of the country\xe2\x80\x99s institutions.\n'

aS' Harvard University on Friday withdrew a fellowship invitation to Chelsea Manning, the transgender U.S. Army soldier who was convicted of leaking classified data, after two leaders in the U.S. intelligence community distanced themselves from the school.   \nManning, 29, was released in May from a U.S. military prison in Kansas where she had been held for passing secrets to the WikiLeaks website in the biggest breach of classified data in the history of the United States. \nThe Harvard Kennedy School of government announced on Wednesday that it had invited the controversial figure to be a visiting fellow and speak at a forum.  \nThe invitation to speak still stands, Harvard Kennedy Dean Douglas Elmendorf said in a statement.  \n\xe2\x80\x9cI now think that designating Chelsea Manning as a visiting fellow was a mistake, for which I accept responsibility,\xe2\x80\x9d Elmendorf said. \xe2\x80\x9cI see more clearly now that many people view a visiting fellow title as an honorific, so we should weigh that consideration when offering invitations.\xe2\x80\x9d \nThe announcement came after U.S. CIA Director Mike Pompeo canceled a speaking engagement at the university on Thursday over the invitation to Manning, whom he called an \xe2\x80\x9cAmerican traitor\xe2\x80\x9d in a letter explaining his decision.  \n\xe2\x80\x9cMy conscience and duty to the men and women of the Central Intelligence Agency will not permit me to betray their trust by appearing to support Harvard\xe2\x80\x99s decision with my appearance,\xe2\x80\x9d he wrote to the school.  \nManning said on Twitter that she was \xe2\x80\x9chonored to be 1st disinvited trans woman visiting Harvard fellow.

aS' The U.S. space agency NASA received a final signal from its Cassini spacecraft on Friday as it ended a groundbreaking, 13-year Saturn mission with a meteor-like plunge into the ringed planet\xe2\x80\x99s atmosphere. \nCassini, the first spacecraft to orbit Saturn, entered the gaseous giant\xe2\x80\x99s crushing atmosphere at 7:55 a.m. EDT (1155 GMT) at about 70,000 miles per hour (113,000 km per hour), the National Aeronautics and Space Administration said. \n\xe2\x80\x9cThis morning a lone explorer - a machine made by human-kind - finished its mission 900 million miles away,\xe2\x80\x9d Cassini project manager Earl Maize said at a news conference on Friday at NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. \xe2\x80\x9cWe believe we got every last second of data.\xe2\x80\x9d \nThe end of Cassini\xe2\x80\x99s voyage, which began with its launch in 1997 and a seven-year journey to Saturn, was met with applause, hugs and tears from NASA officials after its final transmission was received, according to video footage on the space agency\xe2\x80\x99s website. \nOfficials at the news conference displayed the last set of images Cassini captured of Saturn as it crashed into the planet. The planet\xe2\x80\x99s lakes and seas near its north pole were visible, along with detailed views of gaps in its massive rings. \nMaize said Cassini\xe2\x80\x99s data, sent until the final fiery moment, was already being studied by NASA analysts in Arizona. \nThe transmissions are expected to include unprecedented data from the atmosphere\xe2\x80\x99s upper fringe, about 1,190 miles (1,915 km) above Saturn\xe2\x80\x99s cloudtops. The data took 84 minutes to reach NASA antennas in Canberra, Australia, Maize said. \nThe final dive ended a mission that gave scientists a ringside seat to the sixth planet from the sun. The spacecraft\xe2\x80\x99s discoveries included seasonal changes on Saturn, a hexagon-shaped pattern on its north pole and the moon Titan\xe2\x80\x99s resemblance to a primordial Earth. \nCassini also found a global ocean on the moon Enceladus, with ice plumes spouting from its surface. Enceladus has become a promising lead in the search for places outside Earth that could support life. \nThe spacecraft has produced 450,000 images and 635 gigabytes of data since it began probing Saturn and its 62 known moons in July 2004. \nCassini, a cooperative project between NASA, the European Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency, was launched into space in October 1997 from Cape Canaveral in Florida. \nWith the spacecraft running low on fuel, NASA crashed it into Saturn to avoid any chance of it someday colliding with and contaminating Titan, Enceladus or another moon that has the potential for indigenous microbial life. \nCassini started a series of 22 orbital dives in April, using Titan\xe2\x80\x99s gravity to slingshot itself into the unexplored area between the planet and its rings. The spacecraft studied Saturn\xe2\x80\x99s atmosphere and took measurements to determine the size of the planet\xe2\x80\x99s rocky core. \nScientists took to Twitter to share their goodbyes.  \n\xe2\x80\x9cFarewell Cassini, how far you\xe2\x80\x99ve come,\xe2\x80\x9d astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson said on Twitter. \xe2\x80\x9cOn this eve, in fiery death, Saturn & you are one.

aS'On Wednesday, Harvard\xe2\x80\x99s Kennedy School announced that Chelsea Manning, the former Army intelligence analyst and whistle-blower, would be a visiting fellow this fall. The reaction was swift: A day later, Michael Morell, a former acting director of the C.I.A. and also a visiting fellow at the school, resigned from his own fellowship in protest. His resignation was quickly followed by the current director of the C.I.A., Mike Pompeo, canceling a speech scheduled at the school. In a statement, Mr. Pompeo unilaterally declared Ms. Manning a \xe2\x80\x9ctraitor.\xe2\x80\x9d\nOn Friday morning, the school folded, disinviting Ms. Manning in a cowardly act that does immense disservice to its students and the public debate around government secrecy.\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s remarkable that one of the country\xe2\x80\x99s premier educational institutions would bow to C.I.A. pressure and reject a person who has arguably done more to contribute to the public\xe2\x80\x99s understanding of world diplomacy than anyone else in modern times. In early 2010, Ms. Manning leaked a trove of hundreds of thousands of State Department and Defense Department documents, an archive that opened an unparalleled window into American foreign policy. Its documents have been referenced by major news organizations \n that it\xe2\x80\x99s impossible to count them.\nThe important revelations in the Manning documents \xe2\x80\x94 originally leaked to WikiLeaks and published in conjunction with The New York Times and other newspapers \xe2\x80\x94 are also too numerous to name, but they include the fact that the United States \n in Iraq than the government had admitted publicly, that United States soldiers \n and that the United States \n by American soldiers.\nMs. Manning was convicted of violating the Espionage Act and other offenses in 2013, and was sentenced to 35 years in prison. (My organization helped raise money for her legal defense.) In January, President Barack Obama, in one of his last acts in office, commuted her sentence. Altogether, she spent seven years in prison \xe2\x80\x94 more time behind bars than any other leaker in American history. She was also subject to deplorable treatment while in custody that the \n at the time constituted cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment and that more than 250 law professors \n. Whatever your opinion on the value of her disclosures, it should be clear to everyone that Ms. Manning was unduly punished for her supposed crime, and she deserves the opportunity to re-enter the public debate without worrying about the C.I.A. bullying private institutions to disavow her at every turn.\nMr. Morrell, in his resignation letter, quoted unnamed officials claiming Ms. Manning \xe2\x80\x9cput the lives of U.S. soldiers at risk,\xe2\x80\x9d without citing any specific examples. This is a common charge against her, and an unfounded one: The evidence of \xe2\x80\x9cdamage\xe2\x80\x9d from Ms. Manning\xe2\x80\x99s leaks has been grossly exaggerated from the start. During her trial, the government could not point to anyone, soldier or otherwise, who was physically harmed by WikiLeaks\xe2\x80\x99 publications. Even at the time of the leaks, State Department officials were privately admitting that \n the harm the leaks caused to bolster their case.\nHarvard\xe2\x80\x99s decision to rescind Ms. Manning\xe2\x80\x99s invitation is about more than academic spinelessness. In \n defending the decision, Douglas W. Elmendorf, the dean of the Kennedy School, said, \xe2\x80\x9cI think we should weigh, for each potential visitor, what members of the Kennedy School community could learn from that person\xe2\x80\x99s visit against the extent to which that person\xe2\x80\x99s conduct fulfills the values of public service to which we aspire.\xe2\x80\x9d\nIf that\xe2\x80\x99s the Kennedy School\xe2\x80\x99s new policy, let\xe2\x80\x99s take a look. Mr. Morell, for example, \n that the C.I.A. engaged in torture, even in the face of the Senate\xe2\x80\x99s damning torture report released in 2014. When asked about the agency\xe2\x80\x99s decision to conduct forced \xe2\x80\x9crectal feeding\xe2\x80\x9d on a detainee, he refused to answer whether that amounted to torture. Mr. Morell \n for indiscriminate C.I.A. drone strikes that have killed at least hundreds of civilians. He most \n when he told Charlie Rose the United States should be \xe2\x80\x9ckilling Russians and Iranians\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 two countries the United States is not at war with \xe2\x80\x94 in Syria.\nOther 2017 visiting fellows include Sean Spicer, President Trump\xe2\x80\x99s first press secretary, who was \n to the public on almost a daily basis by reporters, and the former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski, who \n against a journalist during the 2016 campaign.\nWhat Mr. Elmendorf and the Kennedy School are saying, essentially, is that no issue or action is off topic for visiting fellows except, apparently, giving information to journalists and informing the public about what its government is doing behind closed doors.\nExcessive government secrecy, the worship of \xe2\x80\x9cnational security\xe2\x80\x9d above all else and the C.I.A.\xe2\x80\x99s disrupting presence overseas are exactly the sorts of issues that the Kennedy School should be questioning and challenging, given the myriad C.I.A. and Pentagon scandals and our country\xe2\x80\x99s constant state of war since Sept. 11. Chelsea Manning\xe2\x80\x99s act of whistle-blowing was a powerful, influential and important contribution to that debate.\n'

aS'The cruel thing about vacations is that they are pleasurable but finite. I recently had time to contemplate this unwelcome fact during a 10-hour flight home from a Greek island where I had spent a paradisiacal two weeks. I found myself wondering about the relationship between the duration of a vacation and the longevity of its mental health benefits.\nIs a large amount of time off the secret to bringing your vacation home with you?\nWe Americans have been preoccupied with the length of our vacations for some time. William Howard Taft, our 27th president, opined on the subject in 1910 in an interview with The New York Times.

For most of us, that is not a possibility.\nNot to worry, I have good news: Vacation research \xe2\x80\x94 yes, there is such a thing \xe2\x80\x94 shows that beyond a week or two away from work, more time off isn\xe2\x80\x99t going to make you happier or calmer or produce more lasting gains of another sort.\nFor example, in a 2012 \n in the Netherlands, in which the duration of the participants\xe2\x80\x99 vacations ranged from 14 to 35 days, researchers found that subjective measures of health and wellness shot up rapidly at the start of the break and then peaked by Day 8. Sadly, these positive vacation effects evaporated after just one day back at work.\nI know this finding runs counter to the popular notion that you can\xe2\x80\x99t sufficiently recover from work stress or burnout without a long and leisurely break. But in fact several other studies have also failed to find a measurable psychological benefit to vacations that stretched beyond two weeks.\nCuriously, the Dutch researchers also found that those who couldn\xe2\x80\x99t resist the urge to do a little work while on vacation were no less likely to reap the benefits than those who avoided all work. So no need to banish your phones entirely. Perhaps the key to enjoyment on vacation is the ability to control what you do, and to do what is most natural to you. Workaholics might find \xe2\x80\x9cenforced\xe2\x80\x9d relaxation stressful. By all means let them work a little on vacation!\nAt first glance, such research seems to support the idea that the best way to maximize the benefits of your vacation is to take shorter and more frequent breaks. Perhaps. But my personal and clinical experiences suggest that there might be something more to the effective vacation than just the proper length: namely, the importance of unexpected, immersive experiences.\nConsider a former patient of mine, a hard-driving guy in finance who rarely, if ever, took time off and who finally agreed to a vacation at the urging \xe2\x80\x94 or more accurately, the threats \xe2\x80\x94 of his wife. Reluctantly, off he went with his wife to Tuscany.\nTwo weeks later, he returned to my office looking unusually relaxed. He related the following incident: He\xe2\x80\x99d been driving in a little village when his car stalled out at a train crossing. Panicked, he and his wife got out and prepared for the worst, when a local farmer came by and offered to tow the car to safety. The farmer also insisted on taking them to his house for lunch, which turned into an all-day affair.\nAt first, the experience disconcerted my patient, who had carefully planned his vacation to the minute. But in the end he could not have been more delighted by this unexpected encounter. In fact, he referred to it repeatedly in his therapy after that.\nMy patient had no pictures or videos to show me, just a sharp and indelible memory that he carried with him. And that I suspect is key to a great and long-lasting vacation: He allowed himself to be open to the unforeseen and immersed in his experience.\nIn contrast, I think back to all the people I observed on my recent vacation armed with smartphones and cameras, diligently documenting the beauty around them. It made me wonder whether in the attempt to record and preserve our pleasure, we become observers of our experience rather than full participants in it.\nLooking at the hundreds of pictures I took drove this possibility home. There were scores of perfect sunsets, shots of the glittering sea \xe2\x80\x94 all beautiful to look at, but largely incapable of arousing in me the feeling of being there. I was probably too busy capturing the moment to be part of it.\nI do have one unglamorous, poorly framed shot of a dish of grilled octopus at a simple seaside taverna where I spent an unplanned afternoon talking with the charming owner. Whether or not I look at that image, when I think of that lunch, the pleasure of the afternoon comes rushing back.\nThat, I believe, is the way to bring your vacation home \xe2\x80\x94 not as a collection of recorded moments but as a few vivid experiences you allow to take you by surprise.\n'

aS'It took six of the strongest men on White House grounds, the story goes, to wrest William Howard Taft\xe2\x80\x99s substantial body out of the bathtub. Taft was born on this day in 1857, and that humiliating story is often the only thing people remember him for \xe2\x80\x94 a real shame, considering his unique position in American political history. As the 27th president and the 10th chief justice of the Supreme Court, Taft is the only person to have served in the highest office of both the executive and judicial branches.\nBut there\xe2\x80\x99s a much bigger problem with the bathtub story: It\xe2\x80\x99s not true \xe2\x80\x94 and yet we seem to be totally fine, if not downright overjoyed, repeating it.\nPerhaps no one in recent years has revitalized the story more than the children\xe2\x80\x99s book author Mac Barnett. In \xe2\x80\x9cPresident Taft is Stuck in the Bath,\xe2\x80\x9d Taft isn\xe2\x80\x99t just overweight, but morbidly obese, red-faced and stark naked, with ample rolls of flesh protruding from every imaginable location on his unwieldy body, overflowing out of a comparatively small bathtub. The secretary of agriculture, summoned to advise the quadruple-chinned president, suggests they grease up everything up with butter. It\xe2\x80\x99s deeply uncomfortable to look at, no less imagine giving to a small child, along with an implicit lesson: It\xe2\x80\x99s okay to laugh at fat people.\nMr. Barnett said \xe2\x80\x9cthere\xe2\x80\x99s no proof this actually happened\xe2\x80\x9d in an interview, but used far less precise language in a note at the end of the book, writing, \xe2\x80\x9cOf course, many people say Taft never got stuck in the bath.\xe2\x80\x9d \n, a boy in Chicago who considers himself a presidential expert, and he was shocked to learn that books could be so misleading \xe2\x80\x94 and mean.\nThe progenitor of the apocryphal tale is Irwin Hoover, known as Ike, a butler and usher who worked in the White House for 42 years, including during Taft\xe2\x80\x99s term, from 1909 to 1913. As Hoover wrote in his 1934 memoir, Taft \xe2\x80\x9cwould stick\xe2\x80\x9d in the tub when bathing and had to be helped out \xe2\x80\x9ceach time.\xe2\x80\x9d Who helped him out? We don\xe2\x80\x99t know, because Hoover only vaguely refers to assistance from somewhere, but doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mention who supplied it, or whether they numbered more than one, let alone six. And how did he or they get Taft out? Hoover doesn\xe2\x80\x99t say it was a particularly arduous event \xe2\x80\x94 just that he needed \xe2\x80\x9chelp\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 and there\xe2\x80\x99s certainly no mention of butter.\nThere are no other eyewitnesses. There\xe2\x80\x99s just one secondhand account to be found in Lillian Rogers Parks\xe2\x80\x99 1961 memoir, \xe2\x80\x9cMy 30 Years Backstairs at the White House.\xe2\x80\x9d But the maid and seamstress started working in the president\xe2\x80\x99s house 10 years after Taft, for whom her mother worked, had left office.\nIn the 104 years since Taft left the White House, the tale has only gotten taller, though no historian has ever substantiated it. The University of Virginia\xe2\x80\x99s otherwise excellent \n, with specializes in presidential scholarship, echoed the myth in its biographical entry on Taft, saying that \xe2\x80\x9cthe nation\xe2\x80\x99s press had a field day\xe2\x80\x9d with the story. Many historic newspapers are thankfully digitized, and yet no articles exist. I looked. I even contacted Peri E. Arnold, the professor of political science at the University of Notre Dame listed as the author of the Miller Center entry, who confirmed it was \xe2\x80\x9cfable,\xe2\x80\x9d but he had not in turn alerted the center. I did, and they removed the line.\nThe best gossip, of course, always contains a grain of truth. Taft was, indeed, very fond of bathtubs. He had an extra large one installed in the White House and on several ships, including the cruiser North Carolina, on which he sailed to Panama to oversee the construction of the canal in 1912. There is a famous photo of that seven-foot-long tub in which four of the men who installed it are comfortably seated inside, grinning at the camera. A mini-Tubgate was \n on June 19, 1915, when \xe2\x80\x9cthe portly ex-President,\xe2\x80\x9d at the time in Cape May, N.J., as a guest of the Pennsylvania Bankers Association, \xe2\x80\x9chad stepped in the tub without realizing the consequences of the sudden rise in the water and had stepped out without noticing the resulting deluge on the floor.\xe2\x80\x9d Plus, Taft broke up so-called \n, a porcelain price-fixing ring given, in retrospect, an unfortunate name.\nAnd Taft was certainly our heaviest president. Jeffrey Rosen, the author of a \n, said Americans saw him as \xe2\x80\x9ca kind of pop culture meme.\xe2\x80\x9d Taft entertained audiences with colorful anecdotes about his size, like the time Secretary of War Elihu Root, having heard he\xe2\x80\x99d taken 25-mile ride on horseback, sent a telegram asking \xe2\x80\x9cHOW IS THE HORSE?\xe2\x80\x9d In 1909, Taft delivered a speech called \xe2\x80\x9cHe Who Conquers Himself is Greater than He Who Taketh a City,\xe2\x80\x9d in which he viewed his weight through a constitutional lens: A healthy democracy and a healthy body are both dependent on self-restraint. And boy, did he know it. Taft had done his share of yo-yo dieting, seeking doctor\xe2\x80\x99s care with inconsistent success. At his inauguration, he weighed 354 pounds, but by his death, he\xe2\x80\x99d gotten down to 280.\nPresidential history is overflowing with impossibly colorful and insightful details about our nation\xe2\x80\x99s leaders, but too often what we repeat only satisfies our appetite for easy caricature, not a real understanding about who our presidents actually were.\nFortunately for Taft, history\xe2\x80\x99s a long game, and it\xe2\x80\x99s never too late to set the record straight. So let\xe2\x80\x99s put to rest the bath story, once and for all, and focus on what may be his real tabloid legacy. After all, Taft is credited with saving the Republican Party in 1912. Without him, there might not be a President Donald J. Trump.\n'

aS'The suburbanization of America marches on. That movement includes millennials, who, as it turns out, are not a monolithic generation of suburb-hating city dwellers.\nMost of that generation represents a powerful global trend. They may like the city, but they love the suburbs even more.\nThey are continuing to migrate to suburbs. According to the latest Census Bureau statistics, 25- to 29-year-olds are about a quarter more likely to move from the city to the suburbs as vice versa; older millennials are more than twice as likely.\nTheir future \xe2\x80\x94 and that of the planet \xe2\x80\x94 lies on the urban peripheries. Hurricanes Harvey and Irma made clear that, especially in suburbs, the United States desperately needs better drainage systems to handle the enormous amounts of rainfall expected from climate change.\nThey also made clear that new, sustainable suburbs can offer an advantage by expanding landscapes that can absorb water.\nHousing affordability is a major driver of the appeal of suburbia, which has historically been, and still is, more affordable, especially for first-time home buyers.\nYet millennial suburbanites want a new kind of landscape. They want breathing room but disdain the energy wastefulness, visual monotony and social conformity of postwar manufactured neighborhoods. If new suburbs can hit the sweet spot that accommodates the priorities of that generation, millennial habitats will redefine everyday life for all suburbanites, which is 70 percent of Americans.\nHow can technology, revolutionary design and planning transform suburban living?\nClimate will determine how environmental goals can be achieved in a given place: solar in the Sunbelt, say, or advanced water management in the rainy regions like the Pacific Northwest. Suburbs of the same age or size don\xe2\x80\x99t share the same potential benefits or needs. Here are some ideas to shape future suburbs into smart, efficient and more sustainable places to live.\nExisting suburbs were developed to maximize house and lot sizes, and some are often locked into aesthetic compliance, like mowed lawns. These communities were also built around cars. Many residential developments offer small parks or playgrounds within walking distance, but require cars to get to bigger recreation areas.\nIn sustainable new suburbs, house and lot sizes are smaller \xe2\x80\x94 in part because driveways and garages are eliminated \xe2\x80\x94 paving is reduced up to 50 percent and landscapes are more flexible. The plant-to-pavement ratio of today\xe2\x80\x99s suburb is much higher than that of cities, but the next generation of suburbs can be even better at absorbing water.\nHouse and open community spaces are set among teardrop-shaped one-way roads, which encourage predictable, safe separation of pedestrians and moving vehicles. New suburban developments will utilize technology like autonomous electric cars (parked at solar-powered remote lots) and smart street lighting, which minimize energy use and harmful environmental impact.\nCommunities will share neighborhood amenities like public access areas, drone ports for deliveries, car pull overs (a wider shoulder in the road for pickup and drop-off) rather than private driveways and open common spaces.\nBusinesses also like locations on urban peripheries. That dynamic is helping to reshape suburbia\xe2\x80\x99s traffic patterns, since many cars avoid urban centers. As cars move to renewable energy, emissions and road noise will diminish. In the near term, we should hope to see more efficient cars and on ride sharing.\nThe use of drones will reduce the need for many car errands \xe2\x80\x94 and their emissions: With their unrestricted air space, suburban communities are likely to be first to receive package deliveries from the drones being tested by Amazon. They would be either hub-based, at Amazon warehouses, within 15 to 20 miles of customers, or truck-based, as with U.P.S. or Workhorse, in which a truck stops and a drone deploys. Small to medium packages \xe2\x80\x94 86 percent of Amazon deliveries are under five pounds \xe2\x80\x94 can be handled by current drones and deliver to covered areas at doorways or at shared car pull-offs.\nIn a future suburban development, a homeowner will order an autonomous car, via an app, from a remote solar-charging lot. As a car approaches, it will \xe2\x80\x9ctalk\xe2\x80\x9d to a home: Lights and other utilities are activated or shut off for greater energy efficiency. Because these suburban homes will not have driveways or garages, front yards can be bigger, devoted to ecological functions or recreational activities.\nThe neighborhoods will be friendlier for pedestrians, with sidewalks and paths that connect to open spaces and communal areas. Before we had fenced-off backyards. In the future we\xe2\x80\x99ll have common recreation spaces or vegetable gardens. Or they can be designed for shared landscape features like forest, vernal ponds or wetlands that help manage storm runoff and control flooding.\nClimate change has resulted in heavier rainfall when storms do come, and there\xe2\x80\x99s a need to store all of this water to prevent catastrophic urban flooding. Less pavement in suburbia means the ground absorbs more rain and snow and less storm water pours into heavily paved urban areas nearby.\nPlanners need to view cities, suburbs and exurbs not as discrete units but as regions, with one integrated environmental and technological system.\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s rare that such a profound change of vision for the future is so close to being achievable. And the millennial generation, with their there\xe2\x80\x99s-an-app-for-that outlook, is the one that will adopt it.\nThey find beauty in the utilitarian, and they know just how quickly radical technologies can change everything \xe2\x80\x94 including the suburb they want to call home.\n'

aS'Michelle Jones served 20 years in prison for a heinous crime: murdering her 4-year-old son. During her two decades behind bars, Ms. Jones compiled a record of accomplishment that would be remarkable even for someone who had never been locked up. She published a scholarly \n on the first prisons for women in the United States. She wrote a play that will open in December in an Indianapolis theater. She led a team of incarcerated women whose efforts won the Indiana Historical Society\xe2\x80\x99s prize for best research project for 2016. Not best research project by prisoners. Best project. Period.\nAll of this helped Ms. Jones gain admission to N.Y.U.\xe2\x80\x99s doctoral program in American studies, where she started last week. But Ms. Jones\xe2\x80\x99s stunning record wasn\xe2\x80\x99t good enough for top administrators at Harvard University, as this paper \n on Thursday. In a rare move, they overturned the history department\xe2\x80\x99s admission recommendation and rejected Ms. Jones.\nMs. Jones\xe2\x80\x99s remarkable story put me in mind of a similar one \xe2\x80\x94 that of \n, the Yale Law graduate whose initial application to the Connecticut bar was recently rejected. Mr. Betts, who was convicted of carjacking in 1996 when he was 16, went on to astonishing success after his release in 2005, including publishing three books, being admitted to a Ph.D. program and being accepted to all of the nation\xe2\x80\x99s top law schools. Yet as he continues to pursue admission to the bar, it\xe2\x80\x99s clear that what matters most is the crime he committed as a teenager.\nCases like that of Ms. Jones and Mr. Betts come at an inflection point in the nation\xe2\x80\x99s history. After 50 years of prison building, more and more Americans are expressing doubts about the harsh policies that have made this country the world\xe2\x80\x99s largest jailer. At the same time, some of the people who have spent serious time in our jails have such impressive resumes that they are penetrating the world of the elite. For so long, the world of \xe2\x80\x9cus\xe2\x80\x9d never touched the world of \xe2\x80\x9cthem\xe2\x80\x9d in many corners of American society. Because of people like Michelle Jones, that is changing.\nWhat will the gatekeepers of privilege do when confronted with gold-star applicants who have a criminal record? Harvard\xe2\x80\x99s answer \xe2\x80\x94 you can never outlive your crime \xe2\x80\x94 is an affront to a first-rate candidate and brings shame on those responsible.\nBut Harvard\xe2\x80\x99s rejection of Ms. Jones (and my university, Yale, rejected her as well, though the reasons remain unclear) is more than that. It reveals the truth about why mass punishment persists and the lie we are telling ourselves about the possibility of redemption.\nHere\xe2\x80\x99s the thing about harsh justice in America. More and more people criticize it, but most eagerly shift the blame for who is responsible. I saw this repeatedly in California, where I just spent a year living and teaching. I lost count of the number of conversations I had with colleagues and friends about criminal justice in which somebody bemoaned the state of affairs in \xe2\x80\x9cthe Trump states.\xe2\x80\x9d I responded by bringing up the fact that California led the prison-building movement in the 1980s and \xe2\x80\x9990s, and would share stories about a visit to San Quentin prison, located just across the water from San Francisco, where I met dozens of men serving life sentences. Nobody from the Trump states put them there, or is keeping them there, I would say. That\xe2\x80\x99s on California voters and their elected officials. That\xe2\x80\x99s on you.\nI suspect that the administrators and professors who helped block Ms. Jones\xe2\x80\x99s admission are a lot like my friends in Connecticut and California. They consider themselves liberal, and they think mass incarceration is a problem. Somebody\xe2\x80\x99s else\xe2\x80\x99s problem. Blame the judges, prosecutors, legislators, police, probation officers, prison guards. Just not us.\nBut rejecting an overwhelmingly qualified candidate like Michelle Jones for no reason other than her criminal record sends a clear message from the bastion of liberalism on the banks of the Charles: If something is to be done to make America more just and merciful, somebody else is supposed to do it.\nIt also exposes the way that our unforgiving system of justice has touched all of our institutions. In court, judges tell people that their conviction carries a sentence of years, or probation. The truth is far more terrible. People convicted of crimes often become social outcasts for life, finding it difficult or impossible to rent an apartment, get a job, adopt children, access public benefits, serve on juries or vote.\nAs eager as I am to champion Ms. Jones\xe2\x80\x99s cause, I do so with one crucial caveat. Michelle Jones and Reginald Dwayne Betts capture our attention because of their extraordinary accomplishments. As compelling as their stories are, we cannot let these exceptional people become the standard by which we judge somebody returning from prison. You shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t need to win awards from a state historical society to gain admission to a Ph.D. program, and admission to the bar shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be reserved for those who write three books and obtain multiple degrees.\nMass incarceration and its never-ending human toll will be with us until we come to see that no crime justifies permanent civic death. N.Y.U.\xe2\x80\x99s acceptance of Michelle Jones is an example of an institution leading the way toward a more forgiving nation. Harvard\xe2\x80\x99s rejection of her shows just how far we still have to go.\n'

aS'These days, the news is full of sensational stories of violent campus mobs shutting down conservative speakers and freaked-out college administrators treating rioters with kid gloves. Such stories offer excellent fodder for critics who are eager to condemn university culture. But I believe they distract from a deeper, subtler intellectual problem on the modern campus: the profound alienation of professors who don\xe2\x80\x99t hold the mainstream political views and are treated as outsiders as a result.\nThis is the argument of an important book titled \xe2\x80\x9cPassing on the Right: Conservative Professors in the Progressive University.\xe2\x80\x9d Written by the political scientists Jon A. Shields and Joshua M. Dunn Sr., it gives a glimpse into the lonely lives of ideological strangers on the modern campus. While conservatives represent America\xe2\x80\x99s largest ideological group, at 36 percent of the population, they constitute less than 10 percent of faculty in the social sciences and humanities \xe2\x80\x94 and a small fraction of that at elite private schools. Many report feeling like oddballs who never quite fit in.\nGenerally, these professors fear they have little hope for advancement to leadership roles. Research backs up this fear, suggesting that intellectual conformity is still a key driver of personal success in academic communities. In a study published in 2012 in the Journal of Experimental Social Psychology, researchers asked students to evaluate candidates vying to represent them with the faculty. In some cases, the candidate identified him- or herself as a \xe2\x80\x9ctypical student at this college\xe2\x80\x9d; other subjects were given a candidate who was \xe2\x80\x9ca relatively untypical student at this college.\xe2\x80\x9d Even though both pledged to represent the students faithfully, in the same language, the untypical student consistently received significantly less support.\nSome might argue that it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter \xe2\x80\x94 or is even a good thing \xe2\x80\x94 that conservatives on campus are marginalized. After all, there are many organizations in which philosophical differences are legitimately disqualifying. No one believes that there is anything strange about a Christian church seeking as clergy members only those who share the congregation\xe2\x80\x99s faith and theology. Buddhists may be wonderful people, but they still need not apply for the job.\nBut such discrimination is legitimate only when it pertains to the core mission of an organization. It would be less sensible and acceptable for a congregation to reject the best-qualified theologian and preacher because of how he or she voted in a presidential election. That church would be prioritizing ephemeral political battles ahead of its deepest spiritual concerns. That\xe2\x80\x99s a pretty bad trade.\nSimilarly, academia is right to rank candidates based on their expertise and intellectual commitment. But should professors\xe2\x80\x99 political philosophies factor into how welcome they are or the likelihood of their leading departments and institutions? Only if the fundamental goal of the university is more political than scholarly.\nSo which is the primary goal of universities today? They are in the process of deciding. If they decide the answer is scholarship, they must work harder to form communities that do not just tolerate conservatives but actively embrace ideological diversity. They must be willing to see conservative faculty members not as interlopers to be tolerated but as valued colleagues, worthy of promotion and appointments to leadership roles when merited.\nFortunately, this problem is not insoluble. It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t that long ago that women were similarly isolated in academia, that it was unusual in many departments to have a female professor and practically unthinkable that a woman be a university president. To be sure, there is still gender discrimination, but a huge amount of headway has been made in integrating departments and elevating women to positions of academic leadership. Why? Because the community has come to see that gender discrimination is inconsistent with a good university\xe2\x80\x99s mission. That\xe2\x80\x99s true progress.\nThere are nascent efforts underway to do the same with ideology. Several top-tier private universities \xe2\x80\x94 notably Princeton, Harvard, Stanford and Chicago \xe2\x80\x94 have made important commitments to protect intellectual diversity on campus. And a new coalition of academics called Heterodox Academy, directed by the New York University psychologist Jonathan Haidt, has formed to foster this movement.\nNotably, more than 40 percent of the members of Heterodox Academy are liberals or centrists. And this brings me to a point I want to make to progressive academics: It is up to you to make campuses more open to debate and the unconstrained pursuit of truth. This is partly because liberals are in an overwhelming majority on campus. But more important, the task fits perfectly the progressive movement\xe2\x80\x99s ethical patrimony. American liberalism has always insisted it is the duty of the majority to fight for the minority, whether or not it suits one\xe2\x80\x99s own private interests.\nWelcoming the stranger is arguably the greatest moral tradition that liberals have. As we start a new school year, there is a golden opportunity to demonstrate this.\n'

aS'The new energy abundance in the United States has given President Trump a historic opportunity not just to expand the country\xe2\x80\x99s economy at home, but also to expand its leadership globally. To maximize this opportunity, he should think about energy as more than a driver of economic growth, overcome the powerful political forces favoring isolationism and retrenchment, and rein in his tendency to alienate countries that should be energy allies of the United States.\nThe embrace of new technologies to extract oil and natural gas at an unprecedented rate has transformed one of America\xe2\x80\x99s enduring vulnerabilities into a strategic asset. Thanks largely to fracking \xe2\x80\x94 hydraulic fracturing of rock \xe2\x80\x94 the United States is now the largest producer of oil and gas combined in the world. America consumes large quantities of energy, so this expanded production has not yet made the country energy independent. But it has greatly decreased its dependence on foreign energy: About a decade ago, the United States imported nearly two-thirds of the oil it consumed; that percentage is now closer to one-fifth. America is now the largest exporter of refined petroleum products and, in the past year, has also become an exporter of crude oil and liquefied natural gas.\nThe benefits of this surge in production go well beyond cheaper gasoline, an improved trade balance and a stronger economy. The boom has also improved the country\xe2\x80\x99s sources of soft power, in part by underscoring America\xe2\x80\x99s enduring edge in innovation and ingenuity.\nThe new output has forced changes in the structure of energy markets in ways that are favorable to the United States. American producers of oil from shale rock have introduced a new business model to the scene: Small investments in exploration and production can bring oil to the market quickly. This weakens OPEC, by making it more difficult for its production cuts to result in sustained increases in oil prices. For the first time in more than a century, the market determines the price of oil with much less influence from any cartel, commission or band of big oil companies.\nNew supplies of natural gas \xe2\x80\x94 and ever cheaper technologies for liquefying it and transporting it \xe2\x80\x94 have helped integrate formerly fractured natural gas markets and made them more efficient. These changes have empowered the consumer of natural gas over the producer \xe2\x80\x94 a big reversal from recent years.\nThe energy boom has also weakened many of America\xe2\x80\x99s competitors, particularly Russia, by both decreasing its revenues and reducing its ability to use its energy resources as a political cudgel. The boom also expands opportunities for the United States to forge new partnerships. For instance, given China\xe2\x80\x99s growing dependence, and America\xe2\x80\x99s waning reliance, on Middle Eastern oil, Beijing may be more likely to work with the United States to stabilize that part of the world. Such changes put America in a stronger position to reinforce the international order.\nDomestically, Mr. Trump has made energy a centerpiece of his efforts to strengthen our economy and create jobs, but he needs to do more than loosen restrictions on oil and gas production: Many non-energy policies of the Trump administration undermine the energy boom and all its potential advantages.\nPresident Trump\xe2\x80\x99s protectionist impulses, for instance, do not square neatly with a booming energy sector. Pulling out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, renegotiating Nafta under the threat of withdrawal and the questioning of the free-trade agreement with South Korea weaken the strong links between trade, global growth and rising energy demand; flagging global energy demand will hurt prospects for American exports of oil and gas.\nOn climate, Mr. Trump\xe2\x80\x99s pledge to withdraw the United States from the Paris agreement could also hurt the American energy boom. Natural gas stands to gain as the world takes strides to tackle climate change: As countries transition to more sustainable energy, they often move away from coal to natural gas. American natural gas exports could benefit from this transition \xe2\x80\x94 but not if countries like China and India also weaken their commitment to tackling climate change and drag their heels in curbing coal consumption.\nSimilarly, Mr. Trump\xe2\x80\x99s talk of retrenchment overseas has made friends and foes nervous about America\xe2\x80\x99s willingness to continue to use its vast sea power to maintain open shipping lanes. Over half of the world\xe2\x80\x99s oil supply and a growing percentage of the natural gas it consumes is transported through these waterways.\nThe aggressive orientation of the Trump administration toward Mexico is also a potential problem for America\xe2\x80\x99s energy sector and the pursuit of energy security. Mexico is by far the largest foreign consumer of American natural gas \xe2\x80\x94 a trend that will increase with recent Mexican electricity reforms. Yet President Trump\xe2\x80\x99s talk about a border wall has spurred a revival in the presidential candidacy of Mexico\xe2\x80\x99s own populist, \n, who is committed to reversing these and other energy reforms. That would not only shrink the largest market for American natural gas but would also dull prospects of the United States, Canada and Mexico of reaching North American energy independence.\nThe Trump administration clearly recognizes that America\xe2\x80\x99s energy position is a huge asset to it. But if it wants to fully embrace the opportunity at hand, it needs to integrate its welcome passion for America\xe2\x80\x99s energy revolution into its broader thinking on foreign policy \xe2\x80\x94 and make sure that it is not undercutting the strategic value of the boom with its non-energy policies.\n'

aS'I visited a summer camp in western Russia in July 2015. Its theme was \xe2\x80\x9cmilitary patriotism,\xe2\x80\x9d and it involved dozens of teenagers lounging around in tents, wrestling, carving wood and making garlands. They were also taking history classes. Joseph Stalin, the Soviet leader who killed millions of Soviet citizens, was remembered fondly.\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhatever your view of Stalin, you can\xe2\x80\x99t deny that he was a strong leader,\xe2\x80\x9d a counselor told me later over steaming bowls of cabbage soup. \xe2\x80\x9cStalin won the war. He made it possible for us to go to space. You can\xe2\x80\x99t just throw out a person like that from history.\xe2\x80\x9d\nRussia has not faced the darker parts of its past, something I spent a lot of time thinking about as a correspondent there. But my own country has memory problems, too. Take the Civil War. Historians tell us it was fought over slavery. But an entirely different version unspooled last month at an Applebee\xe2\x80\x99s in Delaware.\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s too simplified to say the war was over slavery,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jeffrey Plummer, head of a local chapter of the Sons of the Confederate Veterans. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s what\xe2\x80\x99s been taught in the schools, but there\xe2\x80\x99s more to it.\xe2\x80\x9d\nSelective memory, it seems, is a global phenomenon. Think of Turkey and its blank spot where the Armenian genocide should be. Or Japan with its squeamishness about its aggression and mass murder in China. It starts as a basic human impulse to take the sting out of defeat or to avoid admitting some atrocity. But it\xe2\x80\x99s also a way to help cope with a difficult present. And like a growth on a tree ring, it can keep the past off-kilter until some future generation is brave enough to right it.\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn most countries you are more likely to get evasion and nationalistic versions of history than tough grappling with the darker parts of your past, and the U.S. is no exception,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gary Bass, a professor of politics and international affairs at Princeton.\nIn the United States, the Civil War remains \xe2\x80\x9cthe most divisive and unresolved experience Americans have ever had,\xe2\x80\x9d according to David Blight, a historian at Yale. \xe2\x80\x9cThe Civil War is like a sleeping dragon. If you poke it hard enough, it will raise its head and breathe fire.\xe2\x80\x9d\nThat is, in part, because the loser was allowed its own interpretation. The South, facing catastrophic loss of life and mass destruction on a European scale, wrote its own history of the war. It cast itself as an underdog overwhelmed by the North\xe2\x80\x99s superior numbers, but whose cause \xe2\x80\x94 a noble fight for states\xe2\x80\x99 rights \xe2\x80\x94 was just. The North looked the other way. Northern elites were more interested in re-establishing economic ties than in keeping their commitments to blacks\xe2\x80\x99 constitutional rights. The political will to complete Reconstruction died.\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe whole notion of honoring the Confederacy and the sacrifice that your family made became part of what we taught in the schools,\xe2\x80\x9d said Charles Dew, a Williams College historian whose book \xe2\x80\x9cApostles of Disunion\xe2\x80\x9d describes the white supremacist arguments that underpinned the South\xe2\x80\x99s case for leaving the Union.\nTo correct the record, Mr. Dew gave talks about his book in the early 2000s, as part of the National Park Service\xe2\x80\x99s efforts to clarify the causes of the war. Some audiences pushed back, saying, \xe2\x80\x9cMy family did not own slaves, so how could they have been fighting for slavery?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not trying to denigrate your ancestors,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Dew said he told those people. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m trying to explain why the war came and ask everyone to consider the issue with an open mind.\xe2\x80\x9d\nIn Russia, people choked on memory. As the Soviet Union was falling, the sins of the past flooded the present. Newspapers wrote about Soviet repressions. Researchers began documenting political killings. All this, as Russians were losing their jobs, their savings, their respect in the world and their dignity. They could not afford to lose their past. So Stalin became the man who led the Soviet Union to victory in World War II and industrialized a peasant nation.\nGermany is the exception. It took a generation, but German society faced its Nazi past and has emerged as an exemplary democratic culture. That is partly because of the extreme nature of the Nationalist Socialist regime and the devastation of the war it brought. Germans had to come to terms with the Holocaust. The Nazi regime had perhaps overcome the depression, but its increasing brutality left no redeeming qualities.\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn the United States, slavery was embedded in a constitutional regime that at least verbally offered universalizing rights,\xe2\x80\x9d said Charles Maier, a professor of 20th-century history at Harvard. \xe2\x80\x9cThe German cause had no equivalent.\xe2\x80\x9d\nBut while top Nazis were put on trial right after the war, with the world watching, mainstream German society did not fully grapple with the crimes until the 1960s. There was a political shift to the left that encouraged young Germans who posed hard questions about their parents\xe2\x80\x99 past. Even today, there are no major memorials to the perhaps half a million Germans who died in Allied bombing campaigns in Hamburg, Dresden and other cities, as that would be seen an assertion of equivalence.\nIn the years immediately after the war, Japanese society was actually ahead of German society in terms of facing its past, said Ian Buruma, author of \xe2\x80\x9cThe Wages of Guilt: Memories of War in Germany and Japan.\xe2\x80\x9d Leftists then had a strong voice in the media and universities, encouraged by liberals in the American occupation, and the history being taught was starting to grapple with Japan\xe2\x80\x99s wartime atrocities against other Asian peoples. But that early reckoning got bogged down in politics: The United States, together with Japanese liberals, decided the problem was Japanese militarism and gave the country a pacifist Constitution. That alienated the right, causing a rift that persists to this day.\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn Japan, history became politicized,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Buruma said. \xe2\x80\x9cWhenever you hear a right-winger say, \xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s all a left-wing myth, we\xe2\x80\x99re not as guilty as people are saying,\xe2\x80\x99 what he\xe2\x80\x99s really saying is, \xe2\x80\x98We want to revise the Constitution and postwar order imposed by the United States.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9d\nThe argument over Confederate monuments has surprised historians like Dr. Blight, who has studied the war for decades. It is a moment for public education like no other, but with risks. When history\xe2\x80\x99s losers get to define the story, it can create rifts \xe2\x80\x94 with allies, with adversaries or even with our fellow citizens. But so can a sudden, emotional rush to rectify it. Historians say the Confederate statues should be removed slowly, with deliberation, not destroyed in the middle of the night.\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis sudden, almost rage to get rid of monuments kind of violates our instincts as historians,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cBe careful, slow down. If they are taken down, let\xe2\x80\x99s preserve and curate them. These are part of our historical landscape. To just destroy them is not educational.\xe2\x80\x9d\n'

aS'After the plane landed, a bus took us to a ferry, and beneath it we felt the sea. We were tired, hungry, in pain, and in fear about it all. We were gagged, blindfolded and shackled. We were dragged from the ferry to our cages. When we arrived at our cages, we whispered to one another, \xe2\x80\x9cThere is a sea around.\xe2\x80\x9d We could feel it despite all of the pain, confusion and fear. All we were waiting for at the beginning was the sea.\nFew detainees had seen the sea before coming to Guant\xc3\xa1namo. All that the Afghans knew was that it was a lot of water that kills and eats people. They started asking about the sea. People who knew what the sea was, mostly people like me, from Arab countries, tried to explain it to the Afghans, but that made them even more afraid.\nAn Afghan pointed to a cargo plane, and said, \xe2\x80\x9cThe sea is big like this?\xe2\x80\x9d\nBigger, he was told. \xe2\x80\x9cShips can carry many planes that size,\xe2\x80\x9d another detainee said.\nThe Afghans told other detainees that the American interrogators threatened them, saying, \xe2\x80\x9cWhen we finish with you here, you will be taken to the sea, and you all will be thrown there.\xe2\x80\x9d\nIt wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a good beginning with the sea.\nWhen we arrived, the first thing we wanted to know was our location. As Muslims, we pray five times a day, and we must face the Holy Kaaba in Mecca. The direction toward Mecca was impossible to determine when we first got to Guant\xc3\xa1namo.\nDetainees started to consider the facts available: the weather, the birds, the sea. Then, anything that would tell us about our location. Even dreams. One detainee said, \xe2\x80\x9cBased on my dream, we are in Oman.\xe2\x80\x9d Some guessed we were in India because the pipes that held up our cells\xe2\x80\x99 fences had \xe2\x80\x9cMade in India\xe2\x80\x9d written on them.\nFinally, after many months, some detainees who were arrested after Guant\xc3\xa1namo was known about were brought in. They told us we are in Cuba, in Guant\xc3\xa1namo. Some of us might have heard of Cuba, but never Guant\xc3\xa1namo. Some detainees wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t believe it. In the beginning, it was hard for us to pronounce that name, or even memorize it.\nAll we knew was there was the sea.\nSome of the camps in Guant\xc3\xa1namo were closer to the sea than others. After a few months, we were moved from Camp X-Ray to Camp Delta, which was closer to the sea, but we weren\xe2\x80\x99t allowed to see it. The many fences around us were covered with green tarp to block us from seeing the sea. Once, I tried to tear off the tarp, but guards saw me and I was sent to isolation. We tried many times to tear off that tarp. When we did, we saw that there were more walls of fences and tarps, so it was useless.\nPeople will do anything to take their minds away from hell. To remind themselves that a world beyond the hell of Guant\xc3\xa1namo still existed, we wanted to show the Afghans the sea. No matter how we described the sea for them, we knew they must see it for themselves. We got some magazines to show them what it looked like. \xe2\x80\x9cA lot of water,\xe2\x80\x9d they said. \xe2\x80\x9cHow can it carry those ships?\xe2\x80\x9d We explained to them about earth and the proportion of the land to the seas, the rivers, the oceans, how ships sail on water and what kind of ships.\nYears passed, and we missed everything in our lives.\nIt was hard not seeing the sea, despite its being only a few hundred feet away from us. At the recreation area, if we lay on our stomach, we could get glimpses of the sea through small openings below the tarp. When the guards found out, they blocked the openings. In some cells, in some blocks, we could stand on the windows at the back of our cells to see the sea, but that was risky, because the guards punished us every time they saw us standing and looking out. Whenever any of us wanted to look at the sea, we needed to ask one of the other detainees to watch for the guards and warn us if they came around the block. It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t long before the administration made higher covers, blocking us from seeing the sea.\nWhen we asked why, we were told it was for security and safety.\nWe couldn\xe2\x80\x99t see more than 30 feet beyond our cells at best \xe2\x80\x94 walls, fences, green tarps covering everything. I remember how those who couldn\xe2\x80\x99t see the sea kept asking the others to tell them what they saw.\nBut something happened in 2014 that let most of us, finally, see the sea. News that a hurricane was headed toward Cuba caused camp administration to take down the green tarps that blocked us from seeing the sea. The detainees looked so happy when the guards started taking down the covers.\nWe all faced one direction: toward the sea. It felt like a little freedom, to look at it. I heard an Afghan guy shout, \xe2\x80\x9cAllahu akbar!\xe2\x80\x9d at the sight, thanking God for the wonder of the sea, repeating that many times, calling out to his friends.\nThe tarps remained down for a few days, and the detainees started making art about the sea. Some wrote poems about it. And everyone who could draw drew the sea. I could see different meanings in each drawing, color and shape. I could see the detainees put their dreams, feelings, hopes and lives in them. I could see some of these drawings were mixtures of hope and pain. That the sea means freedom no one can control or own, freedom for everyone.\nEach of us found a way to escape to the sea.\nThose who could see the sea spent most of their time watching, listening and looking at that big blue color, which cools our souls. The sea was a little rough, because of the windy weather. Huge waves that rose high and hit the land. Looking at a sea like that was scary, but it was what we got, and it felt good. Afghans started calling out to one another and expressing their feelings about what they saw, and turned to us with many questions about that beast.\nThose days without the tarps were like a vacation. On the last day the sea looked refreshed, calm and lovely. A huge ship sailed close by. Detainees called out to one another to look at the ship. We kept looking at it like something magic would happen and all of us would be freed. But the ship just disappeared. The next day the workers returned and blocked our sight.\n'

aS'Kara Walker has had enough.\nSince her 1994 New York debut, at just 24 years old, at the Drawing Center, she and her artworks have been hailed as \xe2\x80\x9c\n\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9c\n\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9c\n\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9c\n.\xe2\x80\x9d She has won a MacArthur fellowship, was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Letters and has been widely praised as among the most important black artists working today. No pressure or anything.\nMs. Walker is, as she writes in the artist statement for her new show at \n in New York, \xe2\x80\x9ctired of \xe2\x80\x98having a voice\xe2\x80\x99 or worse, \xe2\x80\x98being a role model.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9d She is fed up with \xe2\x80\x9cbeing a featured member of my racial group and/or gender niche.\xe2\x80\x9d She also notes that her new work is not \xe2\x80\x9cactivist\xe2\x80\x9d and we shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t expect answers from her: \xe2\x80\x9cI roll my eyes, fold my arms and wait.\xe2\x80\x9d\nWell, this is what Ms. Walker rolling her eyes and folding her arms looks like: a 151-by-191-inch work at the show, in sumi ink and collage, titled \xe2\x80\x9cChrist\xe2\x80\x99s Entry Into Journalism,\xe2\x80\x9d which combines the imagined and the real as well as the past and present. My eye immediately went to the faces of James Brown and the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Then I noticed Frederick Douglass giving a Black Power salute while holding the swastika-stamped head of what appears to be Donald Trump \xe2\x80\x94 an obvious allusion to the moment, a few months back, when the president seemed to believe Douglass, who died in 1895, was alive.\nElsewhere in the illustration, the president\xe2\x80\x99s look-alike makes another appearance. This time he peeks out from between a Klansman\xe2\x80\x99s legs. The Trump-like character wags his tongue while defecating. In another part of the collage, two black girls swing on a trapeze. Look closer and you see the body of a lynched black man hanging on the branch between them.\nA white woman carries Trayvon Martin\xe2\x80\x99s hoodie-covered head on a tray. A black man is attacked by a police officer in riot gear who holds a turkey leg in one hand and a cellphone in the other. There is a Confederate battle flag. An American flag. And an arm in a Nazi salute.\nThis is just one of her pieces in a show of 22.\nWhile Ms. Walker\xe2\x80\x99s work has always reflected the realities of black America, it has typically focused on the past, particularly the slavery of African-Americans. Never has she so blatantly illustrated the modern.\nThat is why the dissonance between her canvases and her statement has rubbed many people the wrong way. One person said the statement wasn\xe2\x80\x99t \xe2\x80\x9cincredibly innovative or interesting or even resistant.\xe2\x80\x9d Another called it \xe2\x80\x9cfoolish.\xe2\x80\x9d Nell Painter, an acclaimed historian-turned-painter, \n a paradox in being \xe2\x80\x9ctired of being a role model, but still making art about slavery.\xe2\x80\x9d One critic even suggested that if Ms. Walker is sick of her platform, she should \xe2\x80\x9c\nThe outrage is tediously predictable \xe2\x80\x94 and of a piece with the debate that has flared over the political responsibility of artists and celebrities since the election of Donald Trump. Richard Prince \n an image he created of Ivanka Trump years ago and returned the money he got from selling it. In January, the artist Christo \n a project he\xe2\x80\x99d worked on for over 20 years because it was on federal land and he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t condone working to the benefit of the current government. Meryl Streep was greeted with hosannas for her outspoken criticism of the president; Taylor Swift\xe2\x80\x99s silence has been condemned.\nMs. Walker gets all this \xe2\x80\x94 perhaps better than most, given that her work has long been criticized by prominent artists, black and white, who say it is reductive. In 1997, the black artist Betye Saar \n a letter-writing campaign against Ms. Walker\xe2\x80\x99s work, the same year that Howardena Pindell, another black artist, said that Ms. Walker \xe2\x80\x9cconsciously or unconsciously seems to be catering to the bestial fantasies about blacks created by white supremacy and racism.\xe2\x80\x9d Two years later, Ms. Saar said that Ms. Walker\xe2\x80\x99s art was \xe2\x80\x9crevolting and negative and a form of betrayal to the slaves, particularly women and children\xe2\x80\x9d and that \xe2\x80\x9cit was basically for the amusement and the investment of the white art establishment.\xe2\x80\x9d As Ms. Walker wryly put it in an \n with New York magazine in April: \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re in too much of a celebrity culture, but at least that means I can be a disappointment to others.\xe2\x80\x9d\nHer finger-wagging critics are missing the point when they go after her artist statement, which is nothing less than a big middle finger to our current culture of flame wars and empty words. Her statement is another way of saying: Ignore the hot air. Open your eyes and look at the work. The work is saying something strong and clear. It said to this viewer that this country is sick and perhaps we congratulated ourselves too much and too early for moving forward. Progress can so quickly crumble into chaos.\nIf you do open your eyes, you will be schooled by a modern master on American history, racism, aesthetics and politics. It\xe2\x80\x99s far more powerful than any artist statement.\n'

aS'Many Americans, and the American government itself, have expressed shock at the treatment of Rohingya Muslims in Myanmar. The Trump administration has also said it is concerned about persecuted religious minorities in the Middle East. For his part, the president has said he wants to defend the rights of the Castro regime\xe2\x80\x99s opponents in Cuba.\nYet all these protestations will be for nothing if, as the deadline approaches for the White House to make its determination about the number of refugees to be admitted next year, the administration decides to decimate the United States refugee resettlement program. At stake are not just the lives of tens of thousands of victims of war and persecution who dream of starting a new life in America; at risk also are American values, the United States\xe2\x80\x99 reputation and American interests around the world.\nEvery year, the president decides a refugee admission number. Since the 1980 Refugee Act, the average annual admissions ceiling under both Republican and Democratic presidents has exceeded 95,000. For the fiscal year 2017, President Barack Obama decided the number should be 110,000, against the backdrop of a global refugee population that \n. President Trump\xe2\x80\x99s two \xe2\x80\x9ctravel ban\xe2\x80\x9d executive orders already intended to cut the 2017 number by more than 50 percent.\nNow a decision is expected on the number for fiscal year 2018. Inside the administration, there is a debate between fact and fiction.\nThe facts are that the vetting for entry to the United States as a refugee is tougher than for any other means of arrival. Not one of the three million refugees to the United States since 1980 has committed a lethal act of terror on American soil. The Cato Institute \n that a United States resident has a 1 in 3.64 billion chance of being killed by a refugee.\nMeanwhile, some 60,000 Iraqis who have supported the American military and diplomatic effort in Iraq \xe2\x80\x94 as, for example, interpreters \xe2\x80\x94 are \n if the promise of safe passage to the United States is to be honored.\nTo put the reduced number of admissions the Trump administration will permit for 2018 in a larger context, the king of Jordan, an American ally, has said that his country of some 9.5 million inhabitants is at a breaking point, with \n and, by \n, as many more unregistered. Last year, the United States helped resettle more than 19,000 of those most vulnerable Syrians from Jordan. Besides relieving pressure there, this crucially countered the Islamic State\xe2\x80\x99s narrative that America will never offer dignity to Muslims.\nSome more facts. Providing sanctuary is not charity: Researchers \n that over a 20-year period, those who were admitted to the United States as refugees between the ages of 18 and 45 (and more than half of refugees are under 18) will pay $21,000 more in taxes than they will receive in benefits.\nAmerican leadership is a vital part of the story. This time last year, the Obama administration\xe2\x80\x99s response to the refugee crises led to a doubling of refugee admissions pledges by wealthy nations. This year, America\xe2\x80\x99s retreat from its commitments has contributed to a \n fall in the global resettlement total so far this year.\nThe question is whether the Trump administration cares about the facts. Because fiction has its backers. The fiction that the vetting is done by the United Nations, not the United States. That refugees are economic migrants in disguise. That America bears an unfair share of the global burden.\nThe reverse is true: According to \n, the world\xe2\x80\x99s top 10 refugee-hosting countries, places like Uganda, account for only 2.5 percent of global income. Uganda has received more than 600,000 refugees alone from the war in South Sudan since 2016. When I asked its leaders in June if they were going to put up the shutters, their answer was simple: \xe2\x80\x9cIt could have been us. These are our fellow human beings. We cannot turn them away.\xe2\x80\x9d\nIf Uganda can welcome refugees, a country like the United States has no reason to upend a great national tradition. From among its refugee population, America has benefited from entrepreneurs like Andrew Grove and Sergey Brin, entertainers like Gloria Estefan and public servants like Madeleine Albright.\nThe people waiting to know their fate are from every walk of life and every station in society: students, factory workers, accountants, widows. What they have in common is that they have lost everything, including in some cases their husbands or wives, sons or daughters. They have heard the professions of concern and looked to the United States as a beacon of hope. Now they want to know if the words mean anything.\nThe test for this administration is simple. Set a refugee resettlement number around the past level of multiple administrations of 75,000, and this will show that the White House has a head as well as a heart. Gut the refugee program, which the Senate, in the last week, again funded, and the administration will lose any claim to strategy or to humanity.\nCrocodile tears are the worst aspect of diplomacy. Real lives depend on this fateful decision.\n'

aS'In retrospect, it seems incredible I didn\xe2\x80\x99t anticipate the questions.\nMy seventh novel, \xe2\x80\x9cEverybody\xe2\x80\x99s Son\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 about an affluent white couple, their adopted black son, and his search for identity and reconciliation with his past \xe2\x80\x94 came to me in a flash of inspiration. I wrote the story in a white heat, in about four months.\nSo I was unprepared for what interviewers I spoke to about the book asked me: Why, and how, had I chosen to write from the perspective of an African-American protagonist? I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t expected this line of inquiry to come up because, although race and racial identity are central preoccupations of the book, I saw Anton not just as a black character, but as a singular, distinctive character born of my imagination and efforts.\nI soon realized I had been na\xc3\xafve. While I might define myself as an American writer, I grew up in India. That means, to many, I\xe2\x80\x99ll always be an Indian-American writer, with all the freight that the hyphen carries.\nThe assumption by agents, editors and readers was that I would continue writing novels featuring Indian characters or set in India \xe2\x80\x94 as I did in my first six novels \xe2\x80\x94 even though I have not lived there for over 30 years.\nBut I\xe2\x80\x99ve always thought about it this way: If men can write about women and science fiction writers can write about space aliens, surely I can write about someone from a different race. And I have spent my entire adult life in the United States. Why shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t I write about that most American of topics \xe2\x80\x94 race and race relations?\nThe debate about whether writers should create worlds and characters based in cultures other than their own is an important one. At its core, pushback in this area serves as a corrective to centuries of colonialism, stereotypical portrayals and racist caricatures. But I worry about how we balance pertinent questions about appropriation with the creative freedom to push boundaries and take risks that are essential to good writing.\nTo add another wrinkle to this debate, I have never been asked about the appropriateness of creating white American characters, as I did in an earlier novel, \xe2\x80\x9cThe Weight of Heaven.\xe2\x80\x9d Of course, this probably has to do with our country\xe2\x80\x99s ignoble history of racism and racist stereotypes, especially about African-Americans. There\xe2\x80\x99s justifiably less concern about misrepresentation of white Americans.\nIn my career, the skeptical questions about my decision to write black characters have been balanced by the emails I\xe2\x80\x99ve received from black women. Another novel, \xe2\x80\x9cThe Story Hour,\xe2\x80\x9d is about the friendship between an African-American therapist and an Indian immigrant. The therapist, Maggie, is a well-adjusted professional in a loving marriage. Black women wrote to thank me for this. Often I had tears in my eyes when I read their notes. How low is the bar, how badly do we portray black women in this country, I\xe2\x80\x99d think, that readers feel compelled to thank me for a single fair fictional depiction?\nThe black woman who is my protagonist\xe2\x80\x99s birth mother in \xe2\x80\x9cEverybody\xe2\x80\x99s Son\xe2\x80\x9d is very different. She\xe2\x80\x99s addicted to crack and leaves her son locked up in a hot apartment while she goes searching for drugs. If that is all that you know about the book, you\xe2\x80\x99d think that this Indian-American writer was indulging in poisonous stereotypes about black women. But there is also the white father, who epitomizes white privilege and uses his power to get what he wants. In fact, one of the things I wanted to explore is the limits of white liberal piety.\nLiterature is about empathy. If I have done my job well, the reader will understand the forces working against my protagonist\xe2\x80\x99s mother and how, despite her one terrible mistake, she is still the person her son believes her to be \xe2\x80\x94 a good parent.\nI operate in an industry where I have been told to my face that a publishing house won\xe2\x80\x99t look at my book because they \xe2\x80\x9calready have an Indian-American writer.\xe2\x80\x9d I have made my peace with the fact that I have to defer to the publisher\xe2\x80\x99s expertise about the realities of the marketplace. But to limit myself to write books only about India is to condemn me to tell the same stories. And that kind of pigeonholing is a creative death.\nSo, I will continue to tell the stories that I am called upon to tell. I know I\xe2\x80\x99ll spend many more interviews explaining the characters I create, and that this tension contains its own revealing, dramatic and painful story about our culture and history.\n'

aS' A homemade bomb planted in a rush-hour subway car injured 29 people in London on Friday, sparking a huge manhunt for the perpetrators of what police said was the fourth terrorist attack in the British capital this year.\nPrime Minister Theresa May said the device "was intended to cause significant harm," but to the relief of authorities and Londoners, the bomb \xe2\x80\x94 hidden in a plastic bucket inside a supermarket freezer bag \xe2\x80\x94 only partially exploded, sparing the city much worse carnage.\n"I would say this was a failed high-explosive device," Chris Hunter, a former British army bomb expert, said of the blast, which caused no serious injuries.\nThe bomb went off around 8:20 a.m. as the train, carrying commuters from the suburbs \xe2\x80\x94 including many school children \xe2\x80\x94 was at Parsons Green station in the southwest of the city.\nWitness Chris Wildish told Sky News that he saw "out of the corner of my eye, a massive flash of flames that went up the side of the train," followed by "an acrid chemical smell."\nCommuter Lauren Hubbard said she was on the train when she heard a loud bang.\n"I looked around and this wall of fire was just coming toward us," Hubbard said. She said her instinct was "just run," and she fled the above-ground station with her boyfriend.\nChaos ensued as hundreds of people, some of them suffering burns, poured from the train, which can hold up to 800 people.\n"I ended up squashed on the staircase. People were falling over, people fainting, crying. There were little kids clinging onto the back of me," said another commuter, Ryan Barnett.\nPassenger Luke Walmsley said it was "like every man for himself to get down the stairs."\n"People were just pushing," he added. "There were nannies or mums asking where their children were."\nPolice and health officials said 29 people were treated in London hospitals, most of them for flash burns. None of the injuries were serious or life-threatening, the emergency services said.\nTrains were suspended along a stretch of the Underground\'s District Line, and several homes were evacuated as police set up a 50-meter (150-foot) cordon around the scene while they secured the device and launched a search for those who planted it.\nThe Metropolitan Police said hundreds of detectives, along with agents of the domestic spy agency MI5, were looking at surveillance camera footage, carrying out forensic work and speaking to witnesses.\nAmong questions they were rushing to answer: What was the device made from, and was it meant to go off when it did, in a leafy, affluent part of the city far from London\'s top tourist sites?\nBritish media reported that the bomb included a timer. Lewis Herrington, a terrorism expert at Loughborough University, said that would set it apart from suicide attacks like those on the London subway in 2005 or at Manchester Arena in May, in which the attackers "all wanted to die."\nPhotos taken inside the train showed a white plastic bucket inside a foil-lined shopping bag, with flames and what appeared to be wires emerging from the top.\nTerrorism analyst Magnus Ranstorp of the Swedish Defense University said that from the photos it appeared the bomb did not fully detonate, as much of the device and its casing remained intact.\n"They were really lucky with this one, it could have really become much worse," he said.\nHunter, the explosives expert, said it appeared that "there was a bang, a bit of a flash, and that would suggest that, potentially, some of the explosive detonated, the detonator detonated, but much of the explosive was effectively inert."\nPolice and ambulances were on the scene within minutes of the blast, a testament to their experience at responding to violent attacks in London. The city has been a target for decades: from Irish Republican Army bombers, right-wing extremists and, more recently, attackers inspired by al-Qaida or the Islamic State group.\nIn its recent Inspire magazine, al-Qaida urged supporters to target trains.\nBritain has seen four other terrorist attacks this year, which killed a total of 36 people. The other attacks in London \xe2\x80\x94 near Parliament, on London Bridge and near a mosque in Finsbury Park in north London \xe2\x80\x94 used vehicles and knives. Similar methods have been used in attacks across Europe, including in Nice, Stockholm, Berlin and Barcelona.\nIn contrast Friday\'s attack involved the "detonation of an improvised explosive device," said Mark Rowley, head of counterterrorism for the Metropolitan Police.\nAfter chairing a meeting of the government\'s COBRA emergency committee, the prime minister said that Britain\'s official threat level from terrorism remained at "severe," meaning an attack is highly likely, and was not being raised to critical.\nThe country\'s threat level was briefly raised to critical, meaning an attack may be imminent, after the May 22 suicide bombing at Manchester Arena that killed 22 people.\nBritish authorities say they have foiled 19 plots since the middle of 2013, six of them since the van and knife attack on Westminster Bridge and Parliament in March, which killed five people. Police and MI5 say that at any given time they are running about 500 counterterrorism investigations involving 3,000 individuals.\nLondon Mayor Sadiq Khan said there had been a "shift" in the terrorism threat, with attackers using a wide range of methods to try to inflict carnage. Khan, who belongs to the opposition Labour Party, said London police needed more resources to fight the threat. Police budgets have been cut since 2010 by Britain\'s Conservative government.\nThe London Underground, which handles 5 million journeys a day, has been targeted several times in the past. In July 2005, suicide bombers blew themselves up on three subway trains and a bus, killing 52 people and themselves. Four more bombers tried a similar attack two weeks later, but their devices failed to fully explode.\nLast year Damon Smith, a student with an interest in weapons and Islamic extremism, left a knapsack filled with explosives and ball bearings on a London subway train. It failed to explode.\nU.S. President Donald Trump weighed in on Friday\'s attack, tweeting that it was carried out "by a loser terrorist," and adding that "these are sick and demented people who were in the sights of Scotland Yard."\nThe British prime minister gently rebuked the president for his tweets.\n"I never think it\'s helpful for anybody to speculate on what is an ongoing investigation," May said.\n'

aS' Mixed signals from Washington over a possible agreement to preserve protections for young immigrants are increasing anxiety and confusion on college campuses, where the stakes are high.\nAmid the uncertainty, colleges and universities are stepping up efforts to protect students enrolled in the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or DACA, telling them to be hopeful but plan for the worst.\nHarvard University has opened a round-the-clock emergency hotline for immigrants in the program. The University of Illinois at Chicago has posted advice on what to do if federal agents show up on campus. UC Berkeley, the University of San Francisco and many other campuses are offering free legal advice to immigrant students now facing fears of deportation.\nNearly sixty college and university presidents sent a letter urging congressional leaders to make the program permanent out of "moral imperative and a national necessity."\nAn estimated 350,000 of the country\'s nearly 800,000 DACA recipients are enrolled in school, most at colleges or universities, according to a 46-state survey this year by the advocacy group Center for American Progress. Under the program, they were protected from deportation and allowed to legally work in the United States with two-year permits.\nThe top congressional Democrats, Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York and Rep. Nancy Pelosi of California, emerged from a White House dinner Wednesday to say they had reached a deal with President Donald Trump to save DACA. But amid backlash from conservative Republicans, Trump said Thursday that they were "fairly close" but nothing had been agreed to.\nIt was the latest in a confusing back-and-forth on the subject that started last week when the Trump administration announced it was rescinding the program, but gave Congress six months to come up with a legislative fix.\n"I don\'t think anybody can put much faith in the statement that there is a deal, because so much can change," said John Trasvina, dean of the University of San Francisco School of Law and an immigration expert who worked in Washington under the Clinton and Obama administrations. "I\'ve seen tons of times when people think they have an immigration deal, and then it goes away."\nUnder the Trump administration plan, those already enrolled in DACA remain covered until their two-year permits expire. If their permits expire before March, 5, 2018, they can renew them for another two years as long as they apply by Oct. 5. But the program isn\'t accepting new applications.\nThe University of San Francisco, which has about 80 DACA recipients, is advising students to adhere to that deadline and is raising money to help pay the $495 renewal fee.\nDespite reassurances from schools that they\'ll be able to continue attending classes, many students are anxious. They\'re worried about how they\'ll pay for school if they can\'t work.\nAna Maciel, a 23-year-old who works full time to put herself through a University of San Francisco education Master\'s program, says she\'s been on "an emotional roller coaster." She fears being deported to Mexico, the country she left at age 3, and wonders if it\'s smart to keep investing in school if she can\'t work afterward.\n"Is this what I should spend my money on?" Maciel says about her $8,000 tuition. "Everything is up in the air."\nTrump\'s DACA announcement on Sept. 5 came after 10 Republican attorneys general threatened to sue in an attempt to halt the program. They were led by Attorney General Ken Paxton in Texas, which has the second-highest number of DACA recipients after California.\nThree days after Trump announced the administration was phasing out the program, the Arizona attorney general brought a separate lawsuit that claims the state\'s universities cannot provide in-state tuition rates for DACA recipients. Attorney General Mark Brnovich says the schools are violating Arizona law which makes it clear in-state tuition is eligible only to those with legal immigration status. The schools are vowing to fight back.\nAnd critics of the program were swift to denounce the possibility of a deal in Congress. Numbers USA denounced the prospect of making a deal on border security to provide "amnesty for the so called \'dreamers\' to compete and take jobs from Americans and those here legally."\nMeanwhile, immigrants are fearful of being sent back to countries they don\'t consider home.\nAndrea Aguilera, a Dominican University junior in suburban Chicago, worries about being deported and separated from family members, some of whom are citizens. She was illegally brought across the Mexican border at age 4.\n"You never know what can happen under this administration. We do want to feel relief. We\'ve been fighting for something more permanent for a really long time," she said. "It seems like it\'s a game (to political leaders). They don\'t realize how many peoples\' lives are being affected by this."\nAt UC Berkeley, Burmese-Taiwanese national Amy Lin, a 23-year-old doctoral student in the university\'s ethnic studies department, has set up an emergency phone tree for DACA students. She fears Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials might come knocking.\n"The university says it doesn\'t allow ICE agents on campus, but that doesn\'t mean they won\'t come in," said Lin, who was brought to the U.S. illegally at age 12.\nUniversity of California President Janet Napolitano filed a lawsuit last Friday that\'s one of several high-profile legal challenges to Trump\'s decision.\nNapolitano helped create the program in 2012 as Homeland Security secretary under President Barack Obama. The 10 schools in the UC system have about 4,000 students without legal permission to stay in the U.S.\nUC schools are among those offering student loans to DACA students, and they\'ve directed campus police not to question or detain individuals based on their immigration status.\nThe University of Illinois at Chicago, which has hundreds of DACA students, has posted online instructions for students and security staff to call campus police immediately if anyone, including federal agents, comes on campus and starts asking questions.\n"We have to follow the law, obviously," said UIC Provost Susan Poser, but "we\'re going to do everything we can to support (students)."\nAt Agnes Scott College in Decatur, Georgia, president Elizabeth Kiss plans to invite DACA students to her home to meet with an attorney. Georgia bars in-state tuition rates for students without legal immigration status.\n"I have no intention of picking a fight with the Georgia Legislature," said Kiss. "I also have to keep students safe and support their well-being."\n'

aS' The U.N. Security Council was called into emergency session Friday after North Korea conducted its longest-ever test flight of a ballistic missile, to talk about what to do now that Kim Jong Un has ignored its latest round of sanctions.\nFrance\'s Foreign Ministry said in a statement that the country is ready to work on tougher U.N. and EU measures "to convince the regime in Pyongyang that there is no interest in an escalation, and to bring it to the negotiating table." It said North Korea will also be discussed during next week\'s annual gathering of world leaders at the General Assembly.\nThe intermediate-range weapon North Korea launched early Friday from Sunan, the location of Pyongyang\'s international airport, hurtled over U.S. ally Japan into the northern Pacific Ocean.\nThe launch signaled both defiance of North Korea\'s rivals and a big technological advance.\nSince U.S. President Donald Trump threatened North Korea with "fire and fury" in August, the North has conducted its most powerful nuclear test, threatened to send missiles into the waters around the U.S. Pacific island territory of Guam and launched two missiles of increasing range over Japan. July saw the country\'s first tests of intercontinental ballistic missiles that could strike deep into the U.S. mainland when perfected.\nThe growing frequency, power and confidence displayed by these tests seem to confirm what governments and outside experts have long feared: North Korea is closer than ever to its goal of building a military arsenal that can viably target U.S. troops both in Asia and in the U.S. homeland.\nThis, in turn, is meant to allow North Korea greater military freedom in the region by raising doubts in Seoul and Tokyo that Washington would risk the annihilation of a U.S. city to protect its Asian allies.\nU.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres condemned the missile launch as a serious violation of Security Council resolutions, coming less than two weeks after the North\'s sixth nuclear test, which also violated a U.N. ban.\nThe Security Council\'s emergency meeting Friday was behind closed doors.\nOn Monday the council unanimously approved its toughest sanctions yet on North Korea over its nuclear test, which Pyongyang said was a hydrogen bomb. The U.S. said the measures, including a ban on textile exports, combined with previous sanctions would ban over 90 percent of North Korea\'s exports reported in 2016.\nNorth Korea\'s Foreign Ministry denounced the sanctions and said the North would "redouble its efforts to increase its strength to safeguard the country\'s sovereignty and right to existence."\nSouth Korea\'s Joint Chiefs of Staff said the latest missile traveled about 3,700 kilometers (2,300 miles) and reached a maximum height of 770 kilometers (478 miles). Guam, which is the home of important U.S. military assets, is 3,400 kilometers (2,112 miles) away from North Korea.\nDespite its impressive range, the missile probably still is not accurate enough to destroy Guam\'s Andersen Air Force Base, said David Wright, a U.S. missile expert with the Union of Concerned Scientists.\nNorth Korea\'s Rodong Sinmun newspaper said Friday, without mentioning the latest missile test, that its weapons tests demonstrate that it can "turn the American empire into a sea in flames through sudden surprise attack from any region and area,"\nSouth Korean President Moon Jae-in, a liberal who initially pushed for talks with North Korea, said its tests currently make dialogue "impossible."\n"The sanctions and pressure by the international community will only tighten so that North Korea has no choice but to take the path for genuine dialogue" for nuclear disarmament, Moon said. "If North Korea provokes us or our allies, we have the strength to smash the attempt at an early stage and inflict a level of damage it would be impossible to recover from."\nNorth Korea has repeatedly vowed to continue its weapons tests amid what it calls U.S. hostility \xe2\x80\x94 by which it means the presence of nearly 80,000 U.S. troops stationed in Japan and South Korea.\nRobust international diplomacy on the issue has been stalled for years, and there\'s so far little sign that senior officials from North Korea and the U.S. might sit down to discuss ways to slow the North\'s determined march toward inclusion among the world\'s nuclear weapons powers.\nFriday\'s test, which Seoul said was the 19th launch of a ballistic missile by North Korea this year, triggered sirens and warning messages in northern Japan but caused no apparent damage to aircraft or ships. It was the second missile fired from Sunan over Japan in less than a month.\nSouth Korea detected North Korean launch preparations Thursday, and President Moon ordered a live-fire ballistic missile drill if the launch happened. This allowed Seoul to fire its missiles only six minutes after the North\'s launch Friday. One of the two missiles hit a sea target about 250 kilometers (155 miles) away, which was approximately the distance to Pyongyang\'s Sunan, but the other failed in flight shortly after launch, South Korea\'s Joint Chiefs of Staff said.\n'

aS' Now, President Donald Trump genially calls them "Chuck and Nancy."\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and his House counterpart, Nancy Pelosi, have used two White House meetings to become Trump\'s dealmaking partners. But while they have a combined 67-year record in Congress of being willing negotiators, they\'re also partisan Democrats perfectly happy to rumble.\n"Let\'s put it this way, it doesn\'t matter," Pelosi, D-Calif., said in an interview Friday when she was asked if she likes Trump following two recent interactions that yielded a budget deal and progress on immigration. She said she doesn\'t know if Trump likes her, adding, "Right now, I want him to like the Dreamers," the nickname for young immigrants the two Democrats and Trump aim to protect.\nOn Thursday, Schumer, D-N.Y., inadvertently shared his impression of the two leaders\' parley with Trump that moved an immigration agreement forward, catching uninvited Republican leaders flat-footed. At an open Senate microphone, Schumer said, "He likes us. He likes me, anyway," and described warning Trump he\'d be "boxed" if he only works with one party, adding, "He gets that."\nBoth leaders\' comments were instructive.\nPelosi, 77, who was the first female House speaker, is admired as a legislative tactician able to maximize minority Democrats\' strength and as a prodigious fundraiser. Underscoring her penchant for finding allies, Sen. Mike Rounds, R-S.D., said when as governor he called congressional leaders to discuss President Barack Obama\'s pending health care bill in 2009, only Pelosi called back.\nRecounting Wednesday\'s White House dinner that produced an agreement to move forward on immigration, Pelosi, the only woman present, said she was responding to Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross when "the others" interrupted.\n"I said, \'Does anybody listen to women when they speak around here?\'" she said Friday.\nBut critics say that forcefulness also means Pelosi holds power too tightly, not consulting widely enough with junior lawmakers, and is part of an aging cluster of party leaders that\'s frustrating younger, ambitious members.\nSchumer, 66, has been Senate Democratic leader since January and is viewed as a people person. He\'s memorized his colleagues\' telephone numbers \xe2\x80\x94 perhaps because of the limitations of his flip phone \xe2\x80\x94 and is known for emotional visits and calls with senators who\'ve experienced personal losses. Schumer has arranged dates for staffers and said this week that his life\'s big gap was lacking grandchildren \xe2\x80\x94 of which Pelosi has nine.\nWith Schumer\'s saggy suits contrasting with Pelosi\'s tailored wardrobe, the two leaders have known each other since serving in the House in the late 1980s. Then Rep. George Miller, D-Calif., invited Pelosi to join a group of lawmakers that dined weekly and already included Schumer. Pelosi says she and Schumer now meet or speak "as necessary," often daily.\nPelosi\'s four years as speaker began in 2007 and included two years under Obama that saw enactment of his health care law, an economic stimulus package and overhauled financial regulations. She also produced legislation under President George W. Bush and Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, including a bank bailout, a revamping of how Medicare pays doctors and several budget deals.\nThanks to her high profile and unabashed liberal views, Republicans have starred Pelosi in thousands of campaign ads to vilify Democrats.\nThe National Republican Congressional Committee, the House GOP\'s campaign arm, says that in this spring\'s special Georgia election for an open House seat, Pelosi was mentioned in 90 percent of the nearly 7,500 negative ads that helped defeat Democratic candidate Jon Ossoff. One by the Congressional Leadership Fund, which is aligned with GOP leaders, flashed pictures of Pelosi, liberal film maker Michael Moore and violent protesters opposing Trump\'s inauguration as the announcer said, "Jon Ossoff is one of them."\nPelosi is from Baltimore Democratic royalty, daughter of the city\'s congressman and then mayor. She moved to her husband\'s hometown of San Francisco and plunged into local politics, entering Congress in 1987 and leading House Democrats since 2003. She\'s raked in hundreds of millions of dollars for candidates over the years, cementing loyalty from many colleagues.\n"The woman is on (an) airplane every weekend helping someone get elected," said Rep. Gerald Connolly, D-Va.\nBut in a tea party-fueled backlash to the health care law and other big-spending measures, Republicans recaptured the House in the 2010 elections. Shoved back into the minority, small numbers of Democrats have tried ousting her ever since but fallen far short.\n"No one can deny that she\'s an effective leader," said Rep. Kathleen Rice, D-N.Y., one dissident. Rice said "fair or not," Republicans have painted Pelosi with a negative reputation that\'s hurting Democrats\' efforts to win elections.\nThe son of a Brooklyn exterminator, Schumer attended Harvard after scoring nearly a perfect 1600 on college entrance exams. He partly attributes that to a summer job with neighbor Stanley Kaplan, a test preparation industry pioneer.\nAt age 23, Schumer became the youngest member of the New York State Assembly since Theodore Roosevelt in the 1880s. He was elected to the House in 1980 and the Senate in 1998, climbing leadership ranks and leap-frogging into the top post over his one-time housemate in Washington, No. 2 Senate Democratic leader Richard Durbin of Illinois.\nSchumer helped write crime and gun control bills in the 1990s and aid for the New York region after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks and 2012\'s Hurricane Sandy. He was among eight senators who pushed bipartisan immigration legislation through the Senate in 2013, and this year helped strike compromises temporarily financing government and slapping sanctions on Russia.\nHe\'s also kept minority Democrats unanimously against the failed GOP drive to repeal Obama\'s health law, blocked money for Trump\'s wall with Mexico and kept pressure on Trump by railing against his firing of former FBI chief James Comey. That\'s earned tweets from Trump, who\'s called him the Democrats\' "head clown" and "Cryin\' Chuck."\n"We\'ve surpassed most reasonable expectations" this year, said Sen. Brian Schatz, D-Hawaii.\n'

aS' For President Donald Trump, what\'s good for General Motors is great for American workers. Same for Boeing. And AT&T. Not to mention small businesses.\nTrump insists that slashing the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to as low as 15 percent would free up valuable cash. Companies would use the money to boost investment, increase employees\' pay, accelerate hiring and speed economic growth. What\'s more, corporations that now keep trillions overseas to avoid U.S. taxes would bring the money home. American companies could better compete with rivals based in countries with lower tax rates.\n"We\'re going to have magnificent growth," Trump declared aboard Air Force One on Thursday. "We\'re going to go like a rocket ship."\nWould we? Many economists, tax experts and even some business owners say it\'s unlikely. Rather than hire, companies might use much of their tax savings to buy back their stock or increase their dividends to investors. Many companies, they note, have already been able to borrow at historically low rates to expand their businesses yet have chosen not to.\n"The mainstream economic evidence is that the bulk of corporate tax cuts go exactly to whom you would expect \xe2\x80\x94 which is wealthy investors and executives," said Chye-Ching Huang, deputy director of federal tax policy at the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.\nMany economists foresee some benefits from overhauling and simplifying the corporate tax code, just not the extreme growth Trump is promising.\nOne reason corporate tax cuts might provide little overall benefit is the relative health of today\'s economy. Unemployment is already unusually low at 4.4 percent. The economy is in the ninth year of a slow but steady expansion, rather than in a downturn in which tax cuts might deliver a major boost.\nIn a 2014 paper, two economists \xe2\x80\x94 Alexander Ljungqvist of New York University and Michael Smolyansky of the Federal Reserve \xe2\x80\x94 concluded that state corporate tax cuts did little to strengthen economic activity unless the cuts were made during a recession. (The flip side is that they found corporate tax increases to be "uniformly harmful.")\nNor have previous efforts to reduce corporate taxes generally delivered as advertised. Kansas, for example, exempted hundreds of thousands of businesses from corporate taxes and cut individual rates in 2012, only to face a revenue squeeze as the intended economic growth never materialized.\nThe federal government provided a tax "holiday" on overseas profits in 2004 to bring money back into the United States at a discount to the 35 percent rate. But the Obama administration observed later that the move had diminished tax revenue and unintentionally led companies to hoard cash abroad in hopes of receiving that discount.\nThere is also concern that a corporate tax cut would swell the federal budget deficit. When the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center published an analysis this week, it found that even if virtually all tax breaks were eliminated, the corporate rate could drop only to 26 percent without increasing the deficit.\nStill, many companies stress that lower business taxes would lead to more hiring. John Stephens, AT&T\'s chief financial officer, said his company faces a typical tax rate of 34 percent \xe2\x80\x94 including federal, state, foreign and deferred taxes \xe2\x80\x94 in any given year.\nStephens estimates that lower rates would lead the company to immediately invest more money in its phone network, which he said would lead to more hiring by companies that work with AT&T.\n"When we buy more equipment, our vendors hire more," Stephens said. "When we build more extensive networks, we have people \xe2\x80\x94 hard-hat jobs \xe2\x80\x94 building those networks."\nThe AT&T executive added that "anything" would be an improvement on the current corporate tax rate of 35 percent.\nBut like many corporations, AT&T also benefited substantially from tax breaks between 2008 and 2015, saving as much as than $38 billion, according to an analysis by the left-leaning Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy. The administration has yet to spell out all the possible tax breaks that would be eliminated to pay for lower rates.\nEven if the tax rates were slashed substantially, not all companies would see much of a reason to hire more workers. Bill Parks, who owns NRS, an Idaho-based boating gear company, says the tax cuts championed by Trump would no longer do much to help his business.\nYears ago, the lower rates would have helped him because he was maxing out his personal credit cards and taking a second mortgage to fund NRS. But today\'s borrowing rates are so low that investing in workers isn\'t a burden, and tax changes would make little difference to his plans based on how his company is structured.\nGary Cohn, Trump\'s top economic adviser, has argued that the planned tax cuts would help small businesses. By cutting taxes on profits that typically double as the owners\' personal income, those companies would then be able to hire more freely. This assumes that business owners want to expand their payroll rather than just enjoy higher profits.\nLarry Summers, a Democratic former Treasury secretary, this month rattled off a list of reasons to reporters why lower corporate tax rates wouldn\'t deliver as promised.\nThough U.S. companies do face a high rate compared with other countries, Summers said, the fraction of profits being paid in federal taxes is low by historical standards. Corporate income taxes collected last year equaled just 1.6 percent of the economy, according to government records. That compares with 4 percent during the economic boom that followed World War II, an era of growth that Trump appears to want to revive.\nNor, in Summers\' view, would rising stock prices from a lower corporate tax rate shore up the pensions of firefighters, police officers and blue collar workers, as Cohn has argued.\nThose few Americans who still have traditional "defined benefit" pensions don\'t receive any additional income if the stock market rises, Summers said.\n"The argument being made that the corporate tax cuts will somehow benefit workers is weak by the standards of \'trickle-down\' arguments," Summers said.\n'

aS' A white former police officer was acquitted Friday in the 2011 death of a black man who was fatally shot following a high-speed chase, with the judge declaring that he would not be swayed by "partisan interests, public clamor or fear of criticism."\nThe acquittal of Jason Stockley in the death of Anthony Lamar Smith had stirred concerns about possible civil unrest for weeks. Several hundred protesters were marching in the streets of downtown St. Louis within hours of the verdict, but only a single arrest had been reported as of midday.\nThe case played out not far from the suburb of Ferguson, which was the scene of the 2014 fatal shooting of Michael Brown, the unarmed black 18-year-old who was killed by a white police officer. That officer was never charged but eventually resigned.\nStockley, who was charged with first-degree murder, insisted he saw Smith holding a gun and felt he was in imminent danger. Prosecutors said the officer planted a gun in Smith\'s car after the shooting. The officer asked the case to be decided by a judge instead of a jury.\n"This court, in conscience, cannot say that the State has proven every element of murder beyond a reasonable doubt or that the State has proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant did not act in self-defense," St. Louis Circuit Judge Timothy Wilson wrote \n .\nSt. Louis Circuit Attorney Kim Gardner said she was disappointed.\n"While officer-involved shooting cases are extremely difficult to prevail in court, I believe we offered sufficient evidence that proved beyond a reasonable doubt" that Stockley intended to kill Smith, Gardner said in a written statement.\nAssistant Circuit Attorney Robert Steele emphasized during the trial last month that police dashcam video of the chase captured Stockley saying he was "going to kill this (expletive), don\'t you know it."\nLess than a minute later, the officer shot Smith five times. Stockley\'s lawyer dismissed the comment as "human emotions" uttered during a dangerous police pursuit. The judge wrote that the statement "can be ambiguous depending on the context."\nProsecutors objected to the officer\'s request for a bench trial.\nThe Constitution guarantees that people accused of crimes have a right to have their cases heard "by an impartial jury." But defendants can also opt to have the verdict rendered by a judge.\nStockley, 36, could have been sentenced to up to life in prison without parole. He left the St. Louis police force in 2013 and moved to Houston.\nThe case was among several in recent years in which a white officer killed a black suspect. Officers were acquitted in recent police shooting trials in Minnesota, Oklahoma and Wisconsin. A case in Ohio twice ended with hung juries, and prosecutors have decided not to seek a third trial.\nAhead of the verdict, activists in St. Louis threatened civil disobedience if Stockley were acquitted, including possible efforts to shut down highways. Barricades went up on Aug. 28 around police headquarters, the courthouse where the trial was held and other potential protest sites.\nFears of unrest prompted several downtown businesses to send employees home early, including two of the biggest, Wells Fargo Advisors and Nestle Purina PetCare. U.S. Bank closed six branches. Some schools closed early and postponed events scheduled for Friday.\nProtester efforts at civil disobedience were largely unsuccessful. When several demonstrators tried to rush onto Interstate 64, they were blocked on an entrance ramp by police cars and officers on bikes. When they tried to enter the city\'s convention center, the doors were locked.\nThe Rev. Clinton Stancil, a protest leader, said the acquittal was shocking based on the evidence but not surprising.\n"It\'s a sad day in St. Louis, and it\'s a sad day to be an American," Stancil said.\nOne man was arrested for damaging a police vehicle. There were also scattered reports of protesters attacking journalists, authorities said.\nThe St. Louis area has a history of unrest in similar cases, including after Brown\'s death, when protests, some of them violent, erupted.\nIn Smith\'s case, the encounter began when Stockley and his partner tried to corner Smith in a fast-food restaurant parking lot after seeing what appeared to be a drug deal. Stockley testified that he saw what he believed was a gun, and his partner yelled "gun!" as Smith backed into the police SUV twice to get away.\nStockley\'s attorney, Neil Bruntrager, argued that Smith, a 24-year-old parole violator with previous convictions for gun and drug crimes, tried to run over the two officers. Stockley fired seven shots as Smith sped away. A chase ensued.\nAt the end of the chase, Stockley opened fire only when Smith, still in his car, refused commands to put up his hands and reached along the seat "in the area where the gun was," Bruntrager said. Stockley said he climbed into Smith\'s car and found a revolver between the center console and passenger seat.\nBut prosecutors questioned why Stockley dug into a bag in the back seat of the police SUV before returning to Smith\'s car.\nThe gun found in Smith\'s car did not have his DNA on it, but it did have Stockley\'s.\n"The gun was a plant," Steele said.\n'

aS' NASA\'s Cassini spacecraft disintegrated in the skies above Saturn on Friday in a final, fateful blaze of cosmic glory, following a remarkable journey of 20 years.\nConfirmation of Cassini\'s expected demise came about 7:55 a.m. EDT. That\'s when radio signals from the spacecraft \xe2\x80\x94 its last scientific gifts to Earth \xe2\x80\x94 came to an abrupt halt. The radio waves went flat, and the spacecraft fell silent.\nCassini actually burned up like a meteor 83 minutes earlier as it dove through Saturn\'s atmosphere, becoming one with the giant gas planet it set out in 1997 to explore. But it took that long for the news to reach Earth a billion miles away.\nThe only spacecraft to ever orbit Saturn, \n showed us the planet, its rings and moons up close in all their splendor. Perhaps most tantalizing, ocean worlds were unveiled on the moons Enceladus and Titan, which could possibly harbor life.\nDutiful to the end, the Cassini snapped its last photos Thursday and sampled Saturn\'s atmosphere Friday morning as it made its final plunge. It was over in a minute or two.\nProgram manager Earl Maize made the official pronouncement:\n"This has been an incredible mission, an incredible spacecraft and you\'re all an incredible team," Maize said. "I\'m going to call this the end of mission."\nFlight controllers wearing matching purple shirts stood and embraced and shook hands. Project scientist Linda Spilker also had a purple handkerchief to wipe away tears.\n"It felt so much like losing a friend," she told reporters a couple of hours later.\nMore than 1,500 people, many of them past and present team members, had gathered at California\'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory for what was described as both a vigil and celebration. Even more congregated at nearby California Institute of Technology, which runs the lab for NASA.\nThe spacecraft tumbled out of control while plummeting at more than 76,000 mph (122,000 kph). Project officials invited ground telescopes to look for Cassini\'s last-gasp flash, but weren\'t hopeful it would be spotted against the vast backdrop of the solar system\'s second largest planet. The radio link actually held on a half-minute longer than expected.\n"There are times in this world when things just line up, when everything is just about perfect. A child\'s laugh, a desert sunset and this morning. It just couldn\'t have been better," said Maize. "Farewell, faithful explorer."\nThis Grand Finale, as NASA called it, came about as Cassini\'s fuel tank started getting low after 13 years exploring the planet. Scientists wanted to prevent Cassini from crashing into Enceladus or Titan \xe2\x80\x94 and contaminating those pristine worlds. And so in April, Cassini was directed into the previously unexplored gap between Saturn\'s cloud tops and the rings. Twenty-two times, Cassini entered the gap and came out again. The last time was last week.\nCassini departed Earth in 1997 and arrived at the sixth planet from our sun in 2004. The hitchhiking European Huygens landed on big moon Titan in 2005. Nothing from Earth has landed farther. Three other spacecraft previously flew past Saturn, but Cassini was the only one to actually circle the planet.\nIn all, Cassini collected more than 453,000 images and traveled 4.9 billion miles. It was an international endeavor, with 27 nations taking part. The final price tag was $3.9 billion.\nEuropean space officials joined their U.S. colleagues to bid Cassini farewell. Seventeenth-century astronomers supplied the spacecraft names: Italy\'s Giovanni Domenico Cassini, who discovered four moons and the wide division in Saturn\'s rings, and Holland\'s Christiaan Huygens, who spotted the first and biggest moon, Titan.\nThe latest count is 62 moons, six of them found by the spacecraft Cassini.\nThere were some lighthearted touches during the morning. At one point in the broadcast, NASA played a video clip of the Cassini Virtual Singers, spacecraft team members who belted out, "Tonight, tonight, we take the plunge tonight ..." to the music from "West Side Story." Parties were planned for the teams throughout the weekend, complete with Champagne.\nScientists are already eager to go back and delve into the wet, wild worlds of Enceladus and Titan. Proposals are under consideration by NASA, but there\'s nothing official yet. In the meantime, NASA plans sometime in the 2020s to send an orbiter and lander to Europa, a moon of Jupiter believed to have a global ocean that might be compatible for life.\n"These (water) worlds that they found, we never knew were there, are changing how we think about life itself," said NASA\'s science mission director, Thomas Zurbuchen. "And so for me, that\'s why it\'s truly a civilization-scale mission, one that will stand out among other missions, anywhere."\nJulie Webster, spacecraft operations manager for Cassini, said she\'s been blasting the Moody Blues\' "Your Wildest Dreams" in her car the last few days.\n"This has truly been beyond my wildest dreams."\n'

aS' Raul Castro seemed rattled.\nThe Cuban president sent for the top American envoy in the country to address grave concerns about a spate of U.S. diplomats harmed in Havana. There was talk of futuristic "sonic attacks" and the subtle threat of repercussions by the United States, until recently Cuba\'s sworn enemy.\nThe way Castro responded surprised Washington, several U.S. officials familiar with the exchange told The Associated Press.\nIn a rare face-to-face conversation, Castro told U.S. diplomat Jeffrey DeLaurentis that he was equally baffled, and concerned. Predictably, Castro denied any responsibility. But U.S. officials were caught off guard by the way he addressed the matter, devoid of the indignant, how-dare-you-accuse-us attitude the U.S. had come to expect from Cuba\'s leaders.\nThe Cubans even offered to let the FBI come down to Havana to investigate. While U.S.-Cuban cooperation on law enforcement has improved, this level of access was extraordinary.\n"Some countries don\'t want any more FBI agents in their country than they have to \xe2\x80\x94 and that number could be zero," said Leo Taddeo, a retired FBI supervisor who served abroad. Cuba is in that group.\nThe list of confirmed American victims was much shorter on Feb. 17, when the U.S. first complained to Cuba. Today, the number of "medically confirmed" cases stands at 21 \xe2\x80\x94 plus several Canadians. Some Americans have permanent hearing loss or mild brain injury. The developments have frightened Havana\'s tight-knit diplomatic community.\nAt least one other nation, France, has tested embassy staff for potential sonic-induced injuries, the AP has learned.\nBut several U.S. officials say there are real reasons to question whether Cuba perpetrated a clandestine campaign of aggression. The officials weren\'t authorized to discuss the ongoing investigation and demanded anonymity.\nWhen the U.S. has accused Cuba in the past of misbehavior, such as harassing diplomats or cracking down on local dissidents, Havana has often accused Washington of making it up. This time, although Castro denied involvement, his government didn\'t dispute that something troubling may have gone down on Cuban soil.\nPerhaps the picture was more complex? Investigators considered whether a rogue faction of Cuba\'s security forces had acted, possibly in combination with another country like Russia or North Korea.\nNevertheless, anger is rising in Washington. On Friday, five Republican senators wrote to Secretary of State Rex Tillerson urging him to kick all Cuban diplomats out of the United States and close America\'s newly re-established embassy in Havana.\n"Cuba\'s neglect of its duty to protect our diplomats and their families cannot go unchallenged," said the lawmakers, who included Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, a prominent Cuban-American, and the No. 2 Senate Republican, John Cornyn of Texas.\n'

aS' Government troops and their allies intensified an offensive Friday against Islamic State militants in central Syria, trying to consolidate their control on the area.\nThe Syrian troops and Russian military police patrolled the dusty and desolate streets of Okeirbat, which was recaptured from the extremists on Sept. 2.\nA militant counteroffensive was crushed Thursday amid intense Russian airstrikes. Distant thuds of artillery were heard in Friday afternoon and evening, indicating the persistence of the fighting.\nThe militants had controlled Okeirbat since 2014, and Russian military officials showed visiting journalists a bombed-out warehouse that was used by the extremists to repair and fortify tanks in the once-thriving town of 10,000 people, the largest held by IS in Hama province.\nThe fight for Okeirbat, which lies on a strategic route linking western Syria to IS strongholds in the east, reflects the group\'s desperation to retain its presence in Hama province in central Syria.\nIt also shows the determination of the government of President Bashar Assad to uproot the group from the area, which had been a launching pad for attacks.\nThe Russian military has provided extensive air cover for Assad, Moscow\'s longtime ally, in the civil war. It sought to portray the capture of Okeirbat as a major breakthrough, helping an offensive in which Syrian government forces broke a siege by IS militants on the strategic city of Deir el-Zour only two weeks ago.\n"Their defeat here helped to carry out the offensive on Deir el-Zour, reach the Euphrates River and break the siege and liberate Deir el-Zour," said Lt. Gen Alexander Lapin, chief of staff of the Russian forces in Syria.\n"All the conditions are in place for the final stage of defeating IS in the western and eastern corners of Syria," Lapin told a group of international reporters brought to Okeirbat on a tour organized by the Russian Defense Ministry. He spoke while standing on a dusty street next to a building with IS slogans written on the walls of what used to be an Islamic law court.\nAfter Assad\'s troops besieged Okeirbat in mid-August, a Russian missile strike on Aug. 29 destroyed the tank factory, which had been in operation since 2015 providing armored vehicles for suicide missions, Lapin said. Extremist leaflets and ammunition crates still sat on the factory floor.\nThe militants also had an extensive network of underground tunnels, some of them 800 meters (nearly a half-mile) long.\n"The town was prepared for a siege and had a network of underground bunkers, and the Syrian army was fighting the militants for practically every house," Lapin said, adding that the population had dwindled to 2,500, all of whom fled by the time the town was recaptured.\nMore than two weeks of fighting in central Syria has left hundreds dead on both sides, the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. The extremists still hold some villages around it and fighting still continues there.\nThe area is important because it is near villages loyal to Assad. Earlier this week, the extremists shelled the government stronghold of Salamiyeh that is home to members of the minority Ismaili sect, a branch of Shiite Islam.\nOkeirbat was the last stop on the media tour, designed to show the strength of Russia\'s role in Syria, including its naval and air power. But the Defense Ministry also highlighted Moscow\'s humanitarian role in providing basic assistance and security for residents returning to towns recaptured in the civil war, now in its seventh year.\nBacked by Russian warplanes and fighters from Iranian-backed militias, the Syrian government has enjoyed a series of battlefield successes in recent weeks. It has seen an increase in the territory it controls from a low of only 19 percent of the country earlier this year to currently about 48 percent, according to the Observatory.\nFollowing a series of local cease-fires that were negotiated by Russia since May, Syrian and allied troops went on the offensive against IS militants as well as some U.S.-backed fighters, the Observatory said. This thrust the Syrian government into the battle against IS, raising the pressure on the militants. They now control only about 12 percent of Syria, down from about 39 percent months ago, it added.\nAlso on Friday, a newly negotiated "de-escalation zone" in the mostly rebel-held province of Idlib was announced during talks in Astana, the capital of Kazakhstan.\nAlexander Lavrentiev, Russia\'s representative at the talks that are co-sponsored by Turkey and Iran, said 500 soldiers from Russia, Turkey and Iran will probably be deployed to observe and control Idlib, although details are still being worked out. The province is largely controlled by al-Qaida-linked militants and is home to nearly 1 million internally displaced Syrians.\nIn eastern Syria, government forces kept up their offensive on the city of Deir el-Zour, capturing a new neighborhood from IS and increasing their hold to over 60 percent of the city.\nIf the offensive in central Syria quells the remaining militants, it would mean IS will be mostly left in the eastern province of Deir el-Zour as well as a third of the northern city of Raqqa, once the group\'s de facto capital.\nThe Russian-backed offensive in eastern Syria is complicated by a separate and simultaneous campaign of Syrian opposition fighters backed by the U.S.-led coalition. The coalition spokesman said there are no plans to enter Deir el-Zour, indicating there will be no clash over who controls it.\nSyrian government forces have been marching from western parts of the city while U.S.-backed fighters of the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces have been approaching from the north. Mohammed Ibrahim Samra, governor of Deir el-Zour province, said basic services have been restored and a hospital has been reopened.\nMaj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov, a spokesman for the Russian Defense Ministry, said there are still IS fighters on the west bank of the Euphrates River in Deir el-Zour, but most have fled to the east bank.\n'

aS' just became Shuttered Island, and that\xe2\x80\x99s a shame.\nThis was an ambitious plan to build a floating park on the Hudson River off West 13th Street. Pier 55, its official name, was to have stood on pilings in the river, an undulating platform lushly landscaped and dotted with stages for music, dance and theater. It came to be nicknamed Diller Island because the costs \xe2\x80\x94 most recently put at an eye-popping $250 million \xe2\x80\x94 were to be underwritten by the media billionaire Barry Diller and his wife, the fashion designer Diane von Furstenberg.\nAll that is now a dream deferred. Mr. Diller said this week that he was shutting it down because he\xe2\x80\x99d had enough of fast-rising costs and of court fights that lasted several years and seemed destined to continue. A \xe2\x80\x9ctiny group\xe2\x80\x9d of opponents, he said, had \xe2\x80\x9cused the legal system to essentially drive us crazy and drive us out.\xe2\x80\x9d\nOn one level, this was a battle of the mega-rich. It pitted Mr. Diller against Douglas Durst, the New York real estate titan. Mr. Durst has been the money behind the opposition, which consisted mainly of a small civic group and a few allies. They objected to Pier 55 as supposedly having been conceived in secrecy and intended as a playground for the affluent that would disturb aquatic life in the Hudson.\nYet the project, supervised by the \n, had ample blessings elsewhere. The Army Corps of Engineers, which evaluated the environmental consequences, gave it a permit. It also had support from the local community board and from an array of elected officials, including both the governor and the mayor; most days, those two can barely agree on the color of the sky. As for concerns about Pier 55 becoming a preserve for the wealthy, Mr. Diller and the park trust insisted that at least half the arts performances would be free or set at prices low enough to be welcoming to the public.\nThere is a familiar dynamic in New York when the well-heeled put their money behind a new idea: an assumption that something untoward is afoot, including a creeping privatization that must be resisted. Sometimes that is indeed the case. But there\xe2\x80\x99s no evidence it was so this time.\nPerhaps more to the point, New Yorkers can be strikingly resistant to any change in the physical appearance of their city. An entrenched ethos boils down to: Don\xe2\x80\x99t just do something, stand there.\nInstead of Diller Island, all that stretch of Manhattan will have is \n, which is where survivors of the Titanic were taken in 1912 and from where the Lusitania set sail in 1915 on its doomed last voyage in World War I. Pier 54 is its own disaster now, a terminal ruin forced to close six years ago.\nMaybe Mr. Diller\xe2\x80\x99s decision to pull the plug is reversible. Or maybe another person with deep pockets will put up money for this project or something similar. Private money is not necessarily to be shunned. It\xe2\x80\x99s not as if the city is awash in government funds for new parks or other captivating public spaces.\n'

aS'Now that Republicans control both the White House and Congress, top party officials, including Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader, are itching to eliminate the last remaining tool the minority party has to influence a president\xe2\x80\x99s picks for the federal courts \xe2\x80\x94 the so-called blue slip.\nThis longtime but informal Senate practice allows a senator to block the nomination of a judge from his or her home state by refusing to sign off on a blue-colored form. The idea was to give senators, who are presumed to be more familiar with the lawyers and judges in their own states, a meaningful say in the choosing of those judges. It also works as an incentive for moderation in staffing the federal judiciary, which, as the only unelected branch of government, depends on the public trust for its legitimacy.\nBut with Democratic senators now refusing to agree to hearings for two of President Trump\xe2\x80\x99s nominees to the federal appeals courts, Mr. McConnell \n that the blue slip \xe2\x80\x9cought to simply be a notification of how you\xe2\x80\x99re going to vote, not the opportunity to blackball.\xe2\x80\x9d\nWhat a difference a few years make.\nBack in 2009, Mr. McConnell and the entire Republican Senate caucus \xe2\x80\x94 then in the minority \xe2\x80\x94 \n President Barack Obama to honor all blue slips. The appointment of federal judges is a \xe2\x80\x9cshared constitutional responsibility,\xe2\x80\x9d the Republicans said, warning Mr. Obama that \xe2\x80\x9cif we are not consulted on, and approve of, a nominee from our states,\xe2\x80\x9d the senators intended to prevent that nominee from getting a hearing. They expected the blue-slip policy \xe2\x80\x9cto be observed, even-handedly and regardless of party affiliation.\xe2\x80\x9d\nLucky for them, it was. Senator Patrick Leahy, the veteran Vermont Democrat and chairman of the Judiciary Committee at the time, applied the policy without exception, meaning that a single withheld blue slip would torpedo a judicial nomination.\nRepublican senators exploited their blue slips with abandon, and with little or no explanation. One senator blocked a nominee because \n the Constitution did not protect an individual right to bear arms \xe2\x80\x94 an accurate description of the uncertainty about the law at the time. Other senators blocked nominees they had previously approved for other courts, or even recommended to the White House themselves. In all, 18 of Mr. Obama\xe2\x80\x99s judicial nominees were scuttled, including six to the Courts of Appeals. That\xe2\x80\x99s not counting dozens more vacancies that languished for years without a nominee because senators made it clear they would object to anyone.\nThis abuse of blue slips led many, \n, to call for an end to the practice, but Mr. Leahy continued it \xe2\x80\x94 as did Senator Charles Grassley of Iowa, who became chairman of the Judiciary Committee after Republicans won the Senate in 2014. President Trump now has 144 vacancies to fill on the federal bench, many as a direct result of Republican intransigence during the Obama era. So it\xe2\x80\x99s particularly rich, if not surprising, for Republicans to urge its demise.\nWhat led them to this? In short, the same behavior that they had engaged in with impunity. This month, Senator Al Franken, Democrat of Minnesota, \n his blue slip for David Stras, a well-respected but very conservative justice on the state\xe2\x80\x99s Supreme Court whom Mr. Trump nominated to the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit. Last week, Oregon\xe2\x80\x99s two Democratic senators, Ron Wyden and Jeff Merkley, \n another of Mr. Trump\xe2\x80\x99s appeals court picks, Ryan Bounds.\nUnlike their Republican counterparts, however, these Democrats provided a clear explanation for their opposition: The White House, they said, made no meaningful effort to consult with them before making nominations. Mr. Wyden and Mr. Merkley said Mr. Trump had completely bypassed Oregon\xe2\x80\x99s well-established bipartisan selection committee.\nThese are fair complaints. The Constitution gives the president the power to choose federal judges, but only with the \xe2\x80\x9cadvice and consent\xe2\x80\x9d of the Senate. In an earlier era of relative comity and good faith, the blue-slip tradition may have helped to ensure that advice was considered. But in this toxic, hyperpartisan age, there\xe2\x80\x99s no simple way to force a president to listen.\nAnd that is not a minor matter. Any president, not least one who lost the popular vote by almost three million votes, should take account of the wishes and concerns of senators of the opposing party. Mr. Obama made concessions to Republican senators in states like Oklahoma and Utah, and he tried for years to negotiate with others, often to no avail. In contrast, Mr. Trump, not even eight months into his presidency, has farmed out the selection of judges to conservative advocacy groups like the Heritage Foundation and the Federalist Society, which have spent decades plotting for a right-wing takeover of the federal courts.\nThe push toward ever-more extreme judges will only further politicize the third branch. Still, the blue slip is no longer the answer. As \n, senators who oppose a nominee can state their objections on the Senate floor and try to persuade their colleagues \xe2\x80\x94 something Mitch McConnell was too cowardly to do \n, when he refused to allow even a hearing for Merrick Garland, Mr. Obama\xe2\x80\x99s pick for the Supreme Court vacancy.\nFor the next few years, at least, Democrats will have to grit their teeth and watch as hard-right judges begin to restock the federal bench. But Republicans who are gloating right now over their near-total control of Washington might remember one of the more painful realities of politics: No majority lasts forever.\n'

aS'Public servants are supposed to serve the public, not themselves. What part of that equation does Steven Mnuchin not understand?\nThe Trump administration\xe2\x80\x99s Treasury secretary is in hot water again. On Wednesday, ABC News \n that the Treasury Department\xe2\x80\x99s inspector general\xe2\x80\x99s office was looking at his request that a government jet fly him and his new wife on their European honeymoon. The jet costs taxpayers roughly $25,000 an hour to operate. Mr. Mnuchin, a former Goldman Sachs banker, is worth more than $300 million.\nA Treasury spokesman said Mr. Mnuchin made the request, later withdrawn, because he needed the jet\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9csecure communications.\xe2\x80\x9d Since Mr. Mnuchin is fifth in line of succession should anything happen to the president, this excuse was at least a tad more credible than the one offered for a ride he took with his wife, Louise Linton, last month that is also under official review. That trip was to Kentucky, where the couple could view the solar eclipse in the path of totality. The justification then was that Mr. Mnuchin wanted to speak with Kentuckians about tax reform and he needed to check on the gold at Fort Knox, which is presumably as safe and sound after Mr. Mnuchin\xe2\x80\x99s inspection as it was when he got there.\nTaxpayers, who are being reimbursed for Ms. Linton\xe2\x80\x99s travel, may never have known about that junket had she not decided to use a photo of herself alighting from the plane to show off her Hermes, Valentino and Tom Ford ensemble on Instagram. She then savaged a woman from Oregon who dared call the move \xe2\x80\x9c#deplorable.\xe2\x80\x9d As the clothes designers began distancing themselves, Ms. Linton apologized to America \xe2\x80\x94 in an interview with a Washington society magazine that ran a photo of her, in a ball gown, on the cover.\nMr. Mnuchin comes from a world where rich people get free stuff all the time. Now he is in a different world, one where taxpayers are on the hook. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re starting to see a pattern with Steve Mnuchin,\xe2\x80\x9d says Walter Shaub, former chief of the Office of Government Ethics, now at the Campaign Legal Center. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is the tone from the top, that President Trump himself has set: Ethics doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter, and high positions of public trust come with perks.\xe2\x80\x9d\nThe Mnuchins, along with \n, have lost no time establishing themselves as one of the most rapacious It couples in Washington. The \xe2\x80\x9cMoochin\xe2\x80\x99 Mnuchins\xe2\x80\x9d were a hot topic on social media on Thursday, as commenters reviewed the pair\xe2\x80\x99s outrages, the latest dubbed the \xe2\x80\x9cLove Jet.\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Mnuchin was among the first administration grifters to draw attention from government ethics officials when he \n $95 million in assets, including houses in the Hamptons and Los Angeles and a New York City co-op, on his financial disclosure form.\nAn innocent oversight, he said. Then, \n, he, first, acknowledged that as a cabinet member he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t \xe2\x80\x9cpromote anything that I\xe2\x80\x99m involved in\xe2\x80\x9d; then, second, added, \xe2\x80\x9cbut you should all send your kids to \xe2\x80\x98Lego Batman,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d a movie he produced. He then found himself apologizing again, sort of, in a memo to the ethics office, saying, \xe2\x80\x9cIt was not my intention to make a product endorsement.\xe2\x80\x9d\nMs. Linton, who grew up in a Scottish castle, used her gap-year stint as an aid worker in Africa as fodder for a book in which she called herself a \xe2\x80\x9cskinny white Muzungu with long angel hair,\xe2\x80\x9d writing, \xe2\x80\x9cI try to remember a smiling gaptoothed child with H.I.V. whose greatest joy was to sit on my lap and drink from a bottle of Coca-Cola.\xe2\x80\x9d\nBut hey, it\xe2\x80\x99s not like it\xe2\x80\x99s all play and no work for Mr. Mnuchin. He\xe2\x80\x99s been spending plenty of time on Capitol Hill, \n, mostly with himself, on a tax reform proposal about which very little is known except that it will probably include tax cuts for wealthy people like him. Last week, he tried to sell to skeptical conservatives Mr. Trump\xe2\x80\x99s Chuck-and-Nancy deal \xe2\x80\x94 the one with the Democratic leaders of the Senate and House to raise the debt ceiling. He was dismissed as a politically clueless former Democratic donor.\nThis Treasury secretary\xe2\x80\x99s ethical problems make Tim Geithner\xe2\x80\x99s \n look quaint. Steven Mnuchin might be a darling on Wall Street; so far, he\xe2\x80\x99s a disgrace as a public servant.\n'

aS' U.S. President Donald Trump criticized the United Nations for bloated bureaucracy and mismanagement on his first visit on Monday to U.N. headquarters, calling for \xe2\x80\x9ctruly bold reforms\xe2\x80\x9d so it could be a greater force for world peace. \nAhead of his maiden speech to the annual U.N. General Assembly on Tuesday, Trump hosted a short event to boost support for changes to the United Nations. \n\xe2\x80\x9cIn recent years the United Nations has not reached its full potential because of bureaucracy and mismanagement, while the United Nations on a regular budget has increased by 140 percent and its staff has more than doubled since 2000,\xe2\x80\x9d Trump said. \n\xe2\x80\x9cThe United Nations must hold every level of management accountable, protect whistleblowers and focus on results rather than on process,\xe2\x80\x9d Trump said.  \n\xe2\x80\x9cI am confident that if we work together and champion truly bold reforms the United Nations will emerge as a stronger, more effective, more just and greater force for peace and harmony in the world,\xe2\x80\x9d Trump said in his first remarks at the U.N. in New York since his inauguration as president in January. \nIn a building where long statements are commonplace, Trump spoke for just four minutes. More than 120 countries were invited to attend Monday\xe2\x80\x99s reform meeting after signing on to a U.S.-drafted 10-point political declaration backing efforts by U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres \xe2\x80\x9cto initiate effective, meaningful reform.\xe2\x80\x9d \nBusinessman Trump, who complained during his 2016 election campaign about the United States paying a disproportionate amount of money to the United Nations, made the point again on Monday. \n\xe2\x80\x9cWe must ensure that no one and no member state shoulders a disproportionate share of the burden and that\xe2\x80\x99s militarily or financially.\xe2\x80\x9d  \nThe United States is the biggest U.N. contributor, providing 22 percent of its $5.4 billion biennial core budget and 28.5 percent of its $7.3 billion peacekeeping budget. The contributions are agreed on by the 193-member General Assembly. \nGuterres, who also took office in January, told the meeting: \xe2\x80\x9cTo serve the people we support and the people who support us, we must be nimble and effective, flexible and efficient.\xe2\x80\x9d \nHe agreed that U.N bureaucracy was a problem that kept him up at night.     \n\xe2\x80\x9cOur shared objective is a 21st century U.N. focused more on people and less on process,\xe2\x80\x9d Guterres said. \xe2\x80\x9cValue for money while advancing shared values \xe2\x80\x93 that is our common goal.\xe2\x80\x9d \nTrump also said that all peacekeeping missions should \xe2\x80\x9chave clearly defined goals and metrics for evaluating success.\xe2\x80\x9d \nThe United States is reviewing each of the U.N. peacekeeping missions as annual mandates come up for Security Council renewal in a bid to cut costs. The United States is a veto-wielding council member, along with Britain, France, Russia and China. \nOn Sunday night, U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson met with U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi.  \nWhen asked if the U.N. refugee agency could perform its current missions if the United States cut its voluntary contributions to the budget, according to a pool report Grandi answered: \xe2\x80\x9cI would say no.\xe2\x80\x9d \n\xe2\x80\x9cU.S. aid is vital to what we do to support refugees around the world and to find solutions to their situations,\xe2\x80\x9d Grandi said.  \n'

aS' The U.S. military staged bombing drills with South Korea over the Korean peninsula and Russia and China began naval exercises ahead of a U.N. General Assembly meeting on Tuesday where North Korea\xe2\x80\x99s nuclear threat is likely to loom large. \nThe flurry of military drills came after Pyongyang fired another mid-range ballistic missile over Japan on Friday and the reclusive North conducted its sixth and most powerful nuclear test on Sept. 3 in defiance of United Nations sanctions and other international pressure. \nA pair of U.S. B-1B bombers and four F-35 jets flew from Guam and Japan and joined four South Korean F-15K fighters in the latest drill, South Korea\xe2\x80\x99s defense ministry said. \nThe joint drills were being conducted \xe2\x80\x9ctwo to three times a month these days\xe2\x80\x9d, Defence Minister Song Young-moo told a parliamentary hearing on Monday. \nIn Beijing, the official Xinhua news agency said China and Russia began naval drills off the Russian far eastern port of Vladivostok, not far from the Russia-North Korea border. \nThose drills were being conducted between Peter the Great Bay, near Vladivostok, and the southern part of the Sea of Okhotsk, to the north of Japan, it said. \nThe drills are the second part of China-Russian naval exercises this year, the first part of which was staged in the Baltic in July. Xinhua did not directly link the drills to current tension over North Korea. \nChina and Russia have repeatedly called for a peaceful solution and talks to resolve the issue. \nOn Sunday, however, U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley said the U.N. Security Council had run out of options on containing North Korea\xe2\x80\x99s nuclear program and the United States might have to turn the matter over to the Pentagon. \nIn response, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang said the most pressing task was for all parties to enforce the latest U.N. resolutions on North Korea fully, rather than \xe2\x80\x9cdeliberately complicating the issue\xe2\x80\x9d. \nMilitary threats from various parties have not promoted a resolution to the issue, he said. \n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is not beneficial to a final resolution to the peninsula nuclear issue,\xe2\x80\x9d Lu told a daily news briefing.  \nU.S. President Donald Trump has vowed that North Korea will never be able to threaten the United States with a nuclear-tipped ballistic missile.  \nAsked about Trump\xe2\x80\x99s warning last month that the North Korean threat to the United States would be met with \xe2\x80\x9cfire and fury\xe2\x80\x9d, Haley said: \xe2\x80\x9cIt was not an empty threat.\xe2\x80\x9d \nWashington has also asked China to do more to rein in its neighbor and ally, while Beijing has urged the United States to refrain from making threats against the North.   \nThe U.N. Security Council unanimously passed a U.S.-drafted resolution a week ago mandating tougher new sanctions against Pyongyang that included banning textile imports and capping crude and petrol supply. \nNorth Korea on Monday called the resolution \xe2\x80\x9cthe most vicious, unethical and inhumane act of hostility to physically exterminate\xe2\x80\x9d its people, system and government. \n\xe2\x80\x9cThe increased moves of the U.S. and its vassal forces to impose sanctions and pressure... will only increase our pace toward the ultimate completion of the state nuclear force,\xe2\x80\x9d the North\xe2\x80\x99s foreign ministry spokesman said in a statement carried by its official KCNA news agency. \nGasoline and diesel prices in the North have surged since the latest nuclear test in anticipation of a possible oil ban, according to market data analyzed by Reuters on Monday. \nThe international community must remain united and enforce sanctions against North Korea after its repeated launch of ballistic missiles, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said in an editorial in the New York Times on Sunday. \nSuch tests were in violation of Security Council resolutions and showed that North Korea could now target the United States or Europe, he wrote. \nAbe also said diplomacy and dialogue would not work with North Korea and concerted pressure by the entire international community was essential to tackle the threats posed by the north and its leader, Kim Jong Un. \nHowever, the official China Daily argued on Monday that sanctions should be given time to bite and that the door must be left open to talks. \n\xe2\x80\x9dWith its Friday missile launch, Pyongyang wanted to give the impression that sanctions will not work,\xe2\x80\x9c it said in an editorial. \xe2\x80\x9dSome people have fallen for that and immediately echoed the suggestion, pointing to the failure of past sanctions to achieve their purpose. \n\xe2\x80\x9cBut that past sanctions did not work does not mean they will not. It is too early to claim failure because the latest sanctions have hardly begun to take effect. Giving the sanctions time to bite is the best way to make Pyongyang reconsider,\xe2\x80\x9d the newspaper said.  \nPyongyang has launched dozens of missiles as it accelerates a weapons program designed to provide the ability to target the United States with a powerful, nuclear-tipped missile. \nIt says such programs are needed as a deterrent against invasion by the United States, which has 28,500 troops stationed in South Korea. On Saturday, it said it aimed to reach an \xe2\x80\x9cequilibrium\xe2\x80\x9d of military force with the United States. \nThe United States and South Korea are technically still at war with North Korea because the 1950-53 Korean conflict ended with a truce and not a peace treaty. \n'

aS' Around 10,000 finance jobs will be shifted out of Britain or created overseas in the next few years if the UK is denied access to Europe\xe2\x80\x99s single market, according to a Reuters survey of firms employing the bulk of workers in international finance. \nFrankfurt was by far the most popular destination for the new roles, the survey showed, with Paris a distant second. \nThe results from 123 firms came from the first comprehensive public survey to ask the biggest banks, insurers, asset managers, private equity firms and exchanges in Britain about the specific details of their plans so far in case of a so-called \xe2\x80\x9chard\xe2\x80\x9d Brexit.  \nCanvassing was conducted by email and telephone interviews between Aug. 21 and Sept. 15, weeks after companies submitted detailed plans on their Brexit preparations to the Bank of England as required on July 14. The Bank declined to comment on the results of that survey.  \nNearly half of the companies surveyed told Reuters they would have to move staff or restructure their businesses because of Brexit, which is due to take place in March 2019. Another third said it would have no impact, and the remainder said they were still deciding on their plans or declined to comment. \nThe number of jobs to be moved or created overseas was based on answers from 39 companies employing at least 350,000 people. About 1.1 million people work in Britain\xe2\x80\x99s financial sector. \nThe findings suggest that the first wave of job losses from Brexit may be at the lower end of estimates by industry lobby groups and firms, which could mean London will keep its place as the continent\xe2\x80\x99s top finance center, at least in the short term.  \nMost respondents said bigger moves could be in store in a decade or more, however.  \n\xe2\x80\x9cIf it is going to happen it won\xe2\x80\x99t be in one big bang,\xe2\x80\x9d said a senior executive at one of Europe\xe2\x80\x99s largest banks, which took part in the survey. \xe2\x80\x9cThere will be a slow drain of jobs from London over a number of years.\xe2\x80\x9d  \nThe survey also suggests some financial institutions may be delaying decisions, hoping a soft Brexit can be negotiated in talks currently going on in Brussels. BoE Governor Mark Carney has specifically warned companies against that approach, saying it\xe2\x80\x99s important to start planning now. \n\xe2\x80\x9cThey would like to think there is going to be a mutually easy way of dealing with financial services across the EU-UK border,\xe2\x80\x9d said Andrew Gray, global head of Brexit for financial services at PwC. \n\xe2\x80\x9cSo firms are finding it hard to land on precise plans.\xe2\x80\x9d \nLondon\xe2\x80\x99s future as Europe\xe2\x80\x99s premier financial hub is one of the biggest issues in Brexit talks because the sector is the UK\xe2\x80\x99s biggest source of corporate tax revenue.      \n(For details from the poll, please read)  \nFor its survey, Reuters approached 158 of the largest and most internationally focused financial firms in Britain and received responses from all but 35. \nThose included the 20 investment banks that earned the most fees from investment banking in Europe, the Middle East and Africa in 2016, according to Thomson Reuters\xe2\x80\x99 data. \nMany participants gave only partial answers to the survey questions, however, and some asked not to be named and for their data to be used only in aggregate. \nThe number of workers employed by the 75 organizations who provided their staffing numbers added up to 484,578, the bulk of employees in the internationally focused financial sector.  \nThe 39 who gave information on their Brexit staffing plans included many of the companies most likely to be affected by losing the EU financial \xe2\x80\x9cpassport\xe2\x80\x9d mechanism because London is their base to sell services across the EU. \nThe survey indicated 9,777 banking roles would be affected. Many of those would be shifted out of the UK, but some would be new roles in Europe, resulting in a period of duplication, the executives surveyed said. \nInsurance companies said they planned to move or create about 98 jobs overseas and the asset management sector 311 roles, the survey showed. \nU.S. and British banks would see the biggest impact because many use London as their EU investment banking base, which has increased in importance since the 2008 global financial crisis, when banks tried to simplify their international structures into a few main hubs. \nThe impact on Spanish, Italian and Dutch banks was muted because they don\xe2\x80\x99t use London as a hub and have less of a focus on investment banking, the survey showed. \nJapanese lenders such as Nomura, Daiwa Securities and Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group plan to set up subsidiaries in Frankfurt, according to the survey. One said it planned to move about 100 jobs, but asked not to be identified.  \nBank of America (\n) and Credit Suisse (\n), two of the biggest investment banks in London, declined to say how many jobs would be affected. But BofA did say it would pick Dublin as its EU hub if there was a hard Brexit. \nMost in the financial industry picked Frankfurt as their preferred place to put jobs, with 5,470 roles, most of which are the up to 4,000 anticipated moves from Deutsche Bank.  \nParis came second with 1,800 roles, of which 1,000 were planned by HSBC (\n).  \nThe true impact of Brexit will only become clear in ten or twenty years because most firms are implementing a two-stage contingency plan, senior executives in London said.   \nThe first phase will involve relatively small numbers to make sure the requisite licenses and infrastructure are in place. The next will require longer-term thinking about what the companies\xe2\x80\x99 European business will look like. \nThe final impact will also depend on the details of the Brexit deal, Europe\xe2\x80\x99s economic growth and whether Frankfurt and Dublin prove to be successful alternatives to London.   \nPrevious forecasts for jobs losses in a hard Brexit scenario have ranged from about 30,000 jobs estimated by the Brussels-based Bruegel research group in February to up to 75,000 by Oliver Wyman in October and as many as 232,000 by London Stock Exchange chief executive Xavier Rolet in January. \nThe Bruegel estimate was for a three-year period starting from when divorce proceedings were formally triggered in March, according to Dirk Schoenmaker, an author of the report. \nThe Oliver Wyman forecast is up to 2022.  \nThe London Stock Exchange forecast is up to 2024.  \nSome politicians, financiers and academics say bankers have exaggerated the threat to the economy from Brexit. \n\xe2\x80\x9cBrexit presents an inconvenience to their operations but also an opportunity to wrangle tax and rule changes to stay,\xe2\x80\x9d according to Robert Jenkins, a professor at London Business School and a former Bank of England policymaker.  \n\xe2\x80\x9cThey will play this for all it\xe2\x80\x99s worth.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0     \nSeveral banks have heavily scaled back their estimates compared with a year ago. \nJPMorgan, for example, is currently planning to move fewer than 1,000 roles, whereas before the Brexit referendum the bank had said about 4,000 jobs might be at risk. \nPaul Venables, the finance director of Hays, the largest recruiter for financial services in the City, said the job market for financial services in London is gradually improving. \n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere there\xe2\x80\x99s been a lot of public pronouncements from the banks, we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen very little action, we\xe2\x80\x99re not seeing a large number of jobs go outside of the UK to Europe,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re beginning to see tentative signs of that market returning to normalcy.\xe2\x80\x9d  \n(For a graphic on Brexit banks click \n)  \n'

aS' President Donald Trump\xe2\x80\x99s top economic adviser said at the United Nations on Monday that the United States stands by its plans to abandon the Paris climate pact without a renegotiation favorable to Washington, a step for which the international community has little appetite. \nTrump in June announced his decision to withdraw the United States from the Paris agreement, saying it would harm U.S. industries, cost U.S. jobs, weaken American national sovereignty and put the country at a permanent disadvantage to other nations. \n\xe2\x80\x9cWe made the president\xe2\x80\x99s position unambiguous, to where the president stands, where the administration stands on Paris,\xe2\x80\x9d Gary Cohn, director of the White House National Economic Council, told reporters after an informal breakfast meeting with ministers from about a dozen countries on the sidelines of the annual gathering of world leaders at the United Nations. \nIn a statement issued after the meeting, a White House official said, \xe2\x80\x9cWe are withdrawing from the Paris Agreement unless we can reengage on terms more favorable to the United States. This position was made very clear during the breakfast.\xe2\x80\x9d \nU.S. officials attended a Montreal meeting on Saturday of ministers from more than 30 of the nations that signed the climate change agreement. The Wall Street Journal reported that Trump administration officials had said Washington would not pull out of the agreement and had offered to re-engage. \n\xe2\x80\x9cThere was some confusion over the weekend and I think we removed all the confusion,\xe2\x80\x9d Cohn said, referring to the Montreal meeting.  \nU.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said on Sunday the United States could remain in the Paris climate accord under the right conditions. \nCohn, who is overseeing the issue for Trump, on Monday declined to elaborate on suitable terms that the United States would consider to remain in the accord. \n\xe2\x80\x9cThe mood was good,\xe2\x80\x9d Cohn said of the meeting, which was attended by representatives from Brazil, Argentina, the European Union, Japan, Australia and Canada. \xe2\x80\x9cVery constructive. Everyone wants to work together. Everyone wants to understand everyone\xe2\x80\x99s position. I think everyone has a understanding where we all want to get to.\xe2\x80\x9d \nIt takes four years for a country to withdraw from the Paris agreement, so the United States will be a party to it until two days after Trump\xe2\x80\x99s first term ends, if it follows through on the pullout. \nHis planned withdrawal, part of the Republican president\xe2\x80\x99s nationalist \xe2\x80\x9cAmerica First\xe2\x80\x9d message, drove another wedge between the United States and some of its closest allies. His Democratic predecessor, Barack Obama, was instrumental in brokering the deal intended to address one of the leading global concerns of the 21st century. Trump in the past has described climate change as a hoax. \nCohn has been part of the \xe2\x80\x9cstay-in\xe2\x80\x9d accord camp among Trump\xe2\x80\x99s advisers, which also included Trump\xe2\x80\x99s daughter Ivanka and son-in-law, Jared Kushner. Trump\xe2\x80\x99s former chief strategist Steve Bannon was one of the main opponents of the accord before leaving the White House last month. \nFrance, which has staunchly defended the Paris accord since Trump announced his decision to withdraw, said it would push forward with implementation no matter what. \n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve taken note of President Trump\xe2\x80\x99s statements to not respect it, but for the moment no acts have been put into force and we have to hope that we can convince him to change his mind,\xe2\x80\x9d foreign minister Jean-Yves Le Drian told reporters in New York. \n\xe2\x80\x9cTo convince him, international pressure must be strong, but we will not stop the implementation of the Paris accord,\xe2\x80\x9d he added. \nAsked if she had learned anything new about the U.S. position, South African environment minister Edna Molewa said: \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s important to understand one another\xe2\x80\x99s domestic issues.\xe2\x80\x9d She added, \xe2\x80\x9cThis is what I think what\xe2\x80\x99s happening now.\xe2\x80\x9d \nThe climate accord, reached by nearly 200 countries in 2015, was meant to limit global warming to 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) or less by 2100, mainly through pledges to cut carbon dioxide and other emissions from the burning of fossil fuels. U.S. allies have been vocal on its importance. \nA European official at the breakfast told Reuters Cohn made the same points on the U.S. position that he made publicly but with a more positive, open tone. The official said while the United States could remain in it under the right conditions, those were not there yet. \n'

aS' The United States and Iran quarreled over how Tehran\xe2\x80\x99s nuclear activities should be policed at a meeting of the U.N. nuclear watchdog on Monday, in a row sparked last month by Washington\xe2\x80\x99s call for wider inspections.     \nKey U.S. allies are worried by the possibility of Washington pulling out of a 2015 landmark nuclear deal under which Iran agreed to curb its nuclear program in exchange for sanctions against it being lifted. \nU.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley last month called for the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to inspect a wider range of sites in Iran, including military ones, to verify it is not breaching its nuclear deal with world powers. Her remarks were rejected by a furious Tehran. \n\xe2\x80\x9cWe will not accept a weakly enforced or inadequately monitored deal,\xe2\x80\x9d U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry told the IAEA General Conference, an annual meeting of the agency\xe2\x80\x99s member states that began on Monday.  \nHe did not say whether he thought the deal was currently weakly enforced. \n\xe2\x80\x9cThe United States ... strongly encourages the IAEA to exercise its full authorities to verify Iran\xe2\x80\x99s adherence to each and every nuclear-related commitment under the JCPOA,\xe2\x80\x9d Perry added, referring to the deal by its official name -- the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action. \nPerry was speaking shortly after the General Conference formally approved the appointment of Yukiya Amano, a 70-year-old career diplomat from Japan, to a third term as IAEA director general.    \nU.S. President Donald Trump has called the accord \xe2\x80\x9cthe worst deal ever negotiated\xe2\x80\x9d and has until mid-October to make a decision that could lead to Washington reimposing sanctions on Iran.   \nIran\xe2\x80\x99s nuclear chief, Ali Akbar Salehi, told the meeting in Vienna that Washington had made \xe2\x80\x9ca host of unjustifiable peculiar demands with regard to the verification of our strictly peaceful nuclear program\xe2\x80\x9d. \n\xe2\x80\x9cWe remain confident that the (IAEA) will resist such unacceptable demands and continue to execute the agency\xe2\x80\x99s ... role with strict objectivity, fairness and impartiality,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. Salehi also criticized what he called \xe2\x80\x9cthe American administration\xe2\x80\x99s overtly hostile attitude\xe2\x80\x9d \nThe IAEA has the authority to request access to facilities in Iran, including military ones, if there are new and credible indications of banned nuclear activities there, but diplomats say Washington has yet to provide such indications. \nAmano often describes his agency\xe2\x80\x99s work as technical rather than political and has declined to comment on Haley\xe2\x80\x99s remarks about inspections. In a speech on Monday, however, he defended the deal as an important step forward. \n\xe2\x80\x9cThe nuclear-related commitments undertaken by Iran under the JCPOA are being implemented,\xe2\x80\x9d Amano said. \xe2\x80\x9cIran is now subject to the world\xe2\x80\x99s most robust nuclear verification regime.\xe2\x80\x9d \n'

aS' Hurricane Maria picked up strength and roared toward the Leeward Islands on Monday on a track that could whip several eastern Caribbean islands with their second major storm this month. \nMaria grew into a Category 3 storm on the five-step Saffir-Simpson scale, with maximum sustained winds of 120 miles per hour (195 km per hour). It was located about 60 miles (95 km) east of Martinique, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said at 11 a.m. ET (1500 GMT). \nIt was headed west-northwest at about 10 mph (17 kph) on a track that would put it over the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico by Wednesday.  \nMaria was expected to be the second major hurricane this year to hit the Leeward Islands, which were hammered by Hurricane Irma earlier this month, the center said. \nStreets were flooded in some residential parts of the island of Barbados, which had been experiencing heavy rain since Sunday as the storm approached. \nMaria was expected to bring storm surges - seawater driven ashore by wind - of up to 6 feet to 9 feet (1.8-2.7 m), the NHC said. Parts of the central and southern Leeward Islands could see as much as 20 inches (51 cm) of rain, it said.  \nHurricane and tropical storm warnings and watches were in effect for a string of islands in the area, including the U.S. and British Virgin Islands, Antigua and Barbuda and the French-Dutch island of Saint Martin.  \nSeveral of those islands were devastated earlier this month when Hurricane Irma rampaged through the Caribbean as one of the most powerful Atlantic hurricanes ever recorded, killing more than 80 people on the islands and the U.S. mainland. \nPuerto Rico, a U.S. territory which Irma grazed as it headed toward Cuba and Florida, opened shelters and began to dismantle construction cranes that could be vulnerable to high winds as it prepared for Maria. \n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is time to seek refuge with a family member, friend, or move to a state shelter because rescuers will not go out and risk their lives once winds reach 50 miles per hour,\xe2\x80\x9d Puerto Rico Governor Ricardo Rossell\xc3\xb3 told reporters on Monday. \nSome 450 shelters were open, including one in San Juan that is already housing people evacuated by nearby islands hit by Irma, the government said. \nMore than 1,700 residents of Barbuda were evacuated to neighboring Antigua after Irma damaged nearly every building there. \nFurther north, forecasters were also tracking Category 1 Hurricane Jose, which was carrying 75-mph (120-kph) winds and was located about 265 miles (430 km) east-southeast of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina.  \nThe eye of that storm was forecast to remain off the east coast of the United States for the next few days, bringing dangerous surf and rip currents to beaches from Delaware through Massachusetts. \n'

aS'TOKYO \xe2\x80\x94 The whole world confronts an unprecedented, grave and imminent threat from North Korea. On Sept. 3, the regime carried out a reprehensible nuclear test. Late last week, it launched a ballistic missile over my country, Japan, only two weeks after a similar missile launch. By repeatedly testing missiles \xe2\x80\x94 in violation of United Nations Security Council resolutions \xe2\x80\x94 Pyongyang has shown its reach now extends to the United States and Europe.\nNorth Korea\xe2\x80\x99s actions are an outright challenge to the international community. On Sept. 11, the United Nations Security Council unanimously adopted a resolution on a new round of strict sanctions that restrict member states from selling oil to the North, ban North Korean textile exports and ban member states from authorizing North Koreans to work abroad.\nThey are an important step, but the leadership in Pyongyang has consistently ignored previous resolutions. The international community must stay united and enforce the sanctions.\nHere in northeast Asia, the North Korean threat has been real for more than a quarter-century. We face the threat of missiles \xe2\x80\x94 short and medium range \xe2\x80\x94 together with the possibility of chemical weapons attacks.\nNorth Korea has targeted Japan in particular by abducting many innocent Japanese citizens, including a 13-year-old girl who was abducted in 1977. Most of them have been held in North Korea since the 1970s and 1980s.\nEveryone aspires to a peaceful solution to these challenges. And global solidarity is of utmost importance. Still, prioritizing diplomacy and emphasizing the importance of dialogue will not work with North Korea. History shows that concerted pressure by the entire international community is essential.\nIn the early 1990s, North Korea\xe2\x80\x99s announcement to withdraw from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty and the International Atomic Energy Agency was a wake-up call. In response, Japan, the United States and South Korea engaged in dialogue with North Korea and agreed to construct two light-water reactors and to provide heavy fuel oil in exchange for freezing and ultimately dismantling its nuclear program. Japan, the United States and South Korea shouldered most of the financial burden, with the cooperation of Europe and other Asian countries.\nWe know what happened next: Several years after the heavy fuel oil was delivered and construction started on the light-water reactors, North Korea admitted to having a uranium enrichment program in violation of the agreement.\nBy the end of 2002, North Korea expelled I.A.E.A. inspectors, followed by an official withdrawal from the NPT in 2003. China and Russia then joined Japan, the United States and South Korea to create the six-party talks with the North. Pyongyang again agreed to the verifiable denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. But instead, it declared itself a nuclear power in 2005 and carried out a nuclear test in 2006. The five countries\xe2\x80\x99 attempt to solve the problem through dialogue failed.\nIn short, while the international community provided North Korea with sanctions relief and support as \xe2\x80\x9ccompensation\xe2\x80\x9d for its pledges, the regime ignored most of its commitments.\nConsidering this history and its continuing missile launches and nuclear tests, more dialogue with North Korea would be a dead end. Pyongyang would see more talks as proof that other countries succumbed to the success of its missile launches and nuclear tests. Now is the time to exert the utmost pressure on the North. There should be no more delays.\nHow could North Korea relentlessly pursue missile development and nuclear tests over almost half a century? How could North Korea, under successive United Nations sanctions for a decade, acquire enormous resources to obtain crude materials, components and powerful engines? Statistics show that there are countries, mainly in Asia, that continue trading with North Korea; and for some, as recently as in 2016, their trade even exceeded that of the previous year. According to the United Nations, foreign-made parts have been used in North Korea\xe2\x80\x99s ballistic missiles. There are countries buying products and services from North Korea or accepting its workers. Front companies established in Asia enable North Korea access to foreign currencies.\nJapan has responded by reaffirming the ironclad Japan-United States alliance, and Japan has coordinated in lock step with the United States and South Korea. I firmly support the United States position that all options are on the table.\nAs a response to the latest nuclear test, I value the swift and unanimous adoption of Security Council Resolution 2375 on Sept. 11, which puts significantly tougher sanctions on North Korea. But I stress that we must not be simply complacent with the adoption of these sanctions. We must thoroughly enforce the successive resolutions in order to prevent North Korea from obtaining the goods, technologies, funds and people to further develop its missiles and nuclear program.\nNorth Korea poses a serious threat and challenge to our world, and its actions flout the international nonproliferation regime. As swiftly as possible, we must make North Korea end its provocations, abandon its nuclear and ballistic missile development, and return the abductees in North Korea to their homes.\nSolidarity and concerted effort among the international community, together with the effective role of the United Nations, are more vital than ever.\n'

aS'Exactly 230 years ago, on Sept. 17, 1787, a group of men in Philadelphia concluded a summer of sophisticated, impassioned debates about the fate of their fledgling nation. The document that emerged, our Constitution, is often thought of as part of an aristocratic counterrevolution that stands in contrast to the democratic revolution of 1776. But our Constitution has at least one radical feature: It isn\xe2\x80\x99t designed for a society with economic inequality.\nThere are other things the Constitution wasn\xe2\x80\x99t written for, of course. The founders didn\xe2\x80\x99t foresee America becoming a global superpower. They didn\xe2\x80\x99t plan for the internet or nuclear weapons. And they certainly couldn\xe2\x80\x99t have imagined a former reality television star president. Commentators wring their hands over all of these transformations \xe2\x80\x94 though these days, they tend to focus on whether this country\xe2\x80\x99s founding document can survive the current president.\nBut there is a different, and far more stubborn, risk that our country faces \xe2\x80\x94 and which, arguably, led to the TV star turned president in the first place. Our Constitution was not built for a country with so much wealth concentrated at the very top nor for the threats that invariably accompany it: oligarchs and populist demagogues.\nFrom the ancient Greeks to the American founders, statesmen and political philosophers were obsessed with the problem of economic inequality. Unequal societies were subject to constant strife \xe2\x80\x94 even revolution. The rich would tyrannize the poor, and the poor would revolt against the rich.\nThe solution was to build economic class right into the structure of government. In England, for example, the structure of government balanced lords and commoners. In ancient Rome, there was the patrician Senate for the wealthy, and the Tribune of the Plebeians for everyone else. We can think of these as class-warfare constitutions: Each class has a share in governing, and a check on the other. Those checks prevent oligarchy on the one hand and a tyranny founded on populist demagogy on the other.\nWhat is surprising about the design of our Constitution is that it isn\xe2\x80\x99t a class warfare constitution. Our Constitution doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mandate that only the wealthy can become senators, and we don\xe2\x80\x99t have a tribune of the plebs. Our founding charter doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have structural checks and balances between economic classes: not between rich and poor, and certainly not between corporate interests and ordinary workers. This was a radical change in the history of constitutional government.\nAnd it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t an oversight. The founding generation knew how to write class-warfare constitutions \xe2\x80\x94 they even debated such proposals during the summer of 1787. But they ultimately chose a framework for government that didn\xe2\x80\x99t pit class against class. Part of the reason was practical.\n from the secret debates at the Philadelphia Convention show that the delegates had a hard time agreeing on how they would design such a class-based system. But part of the reason was political: They knew the American people wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t agree to that kind of government.\nAt the time, many Americans believed the new nation would not be afflicted by the problems that accompanied economic inequality because there simply wasn\xe2\x80\x99t much inequality within the political community of white men. Today we tend to emphasize how undemocratic the founding era was when judged by our values \xe2\x80\x94 its exclusion of women, enslavement of African-Americans, violence against Native Americans. But in doing so, we risk missing something important: Many in the founding generation believed America was exceptional because of the extraordinary degree of economic equality within the political community as they defined it.\nUnlike Europe, America wasn\xe2\x80\x99t bogged down by the legacy of feudalism, nor did it have a hereditary aristocracy. Noah Webster, best known for his dictionary, commented that there were \xe2\x80\x9csmall inequalities of property,\xe2\x80\x9d a fact that distinguished America from Europe and the rest of the world. Equality of property, he believed, was crucial for sustaining a republic. During the Constitutional Convention, South Carolinan Charles Pinckney said America had \xe2\x80\x9ca greater equality than is to be found among the people of any other country.\xe2\x80\x9d As long as the new nation could expand west, he thought, it would be possible to have a citizenry of independent yeoman farmers. In a community with economic equality, there was simply no need for constitutional structures to manage the clash between the wealthy and everyone else.\nThe problem, of course, is that economic inequality has been on the rise for at least the last generation. In 1976 the richest 1 percent of Americans took home about 8.5 percent of our national income. Today they take home more than 20 percent. In major sectors of the economy \xe2\x80\x94 banking, airlines, agriculture, pharmaceuticals, telecommunications \xe2\x80\x94 economic power is increasingly concentrated in a small number of companies.\nWhile much of the debate has been on the moral or economic consequences of economic inequality, the more fundamental problem is that our constitutional system might not survive in an unequal economy. Campaign contributions, lobbying, the revolving door of industry insiders working in government, interest group influence over regulators and even think tanks \xe2\x80\x94 all of these features of our current political system skew policy making to favor the wealthy and entrenched economic interests. \xe2\x80\x9cThe rich will strive to establish their dominion and enslave the rest,\xe2\x80\x9d Gouverneur Morris observed in 1787. \xe2\x80\x9cThey always did. They always will.\xe2\x80\x9d An oligarchy \xe2\x80\x94 not a republic \xe2\x80\x94 is the inevitable result.\nAs a republic descends into an oligarchy, the people revolt. Populist revolts are rarely anarchic; they require leadership. Morris predicted that the rich would take advantage of the people\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cpassions\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cmake these the instruments for oppressing them.\xe2\x80\x9d The future Broadway sensation Alexander Hamilton put it more clearly: \xe2\x80\x9cOf those men who have overturned the liberties of republics, the greatest number have begun their career by paying an obsequious court to the people: commencing demagogues, and ending tyrants.\xe2\x80\x9d\nStarting more than a century ago, amid the first Gilded Age, Americans confronted rising inequality, rapid industrial change, a communications and transportation revolution and the emergence of monopolies. Populists and progressives responded by pushing for reforms that would tame the great concentrations of wealth and power that were corrupting government.\nOn the economic side, they invented antitrust laws and public utilities regulation, established an income tax, and fought for minimum wages. On the political side, they passed campaign finance regulations and amended the Constitution so the people would get to elect senators directly. They did these things because they knew that our republican form of government could not survive in an economically unequal society. As Theodore Roosevelt wrote, \xe2\x80\x9cThere can be no real political democracy unless there is something approaching an economic democracy.\xe2\x80\x9d\nFor all its resilience and longevity, our Constitution doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have structural checks built into it to prevent oligarchy or populist demagogues. It was written on the assumption that America would remain relatively equal economically. Even the father of the Constitution understood this. Toward the end of his life, Madison worried that the number of Americans who had only the \xe2\x80\x9cbare necessities of life\xe2\x80\x9d would one day increase. When it did, he\n, the institutions and laws of the country would need to be adapted, and that task would require \xe2\x80\x9call the wisdom of the wisest patriots.\xe2\x80\x9d\nWith economic inequality rising and the middle class collapsing, the deep question we must ask today is whether our generation has wise patriots who, like the progressives a century ago, will adapt the institutions and laws of our country \xe2\x80\x94 and save our republic.\n'

aS'If you look closely at Brown v. Board of Education, the landmark 1954 school desegregation decision, you\xe2\x80\x99ll see that Brown wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a single case. It was five cases consolidated into one. Briggs v. Elliott, the first of them, took place in my home state, South Carolina. Briggs came about after the Rev. Joseph De Laine organized a group of black parents in Clarendon County to petition for equal educational facilities. The man who stood fast against that request \xe2\x80\x94 the Elliott of Briggs v. Elliott \xe2\x80\x94 was the chairman of the school board, Roderick Miles Elliott. Or as he was known in my family, Uncle Roddy.\nAlthough I grew up in South Carolina in the 1960s and \xe2\x80\x9970s, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t learn about Briggs v. Elliott until I was an adult. My father, Uncle Roddy\xe2\x80\x99s nephew, often talked about how shamefully black people were treated in Clarendon County, but he was deeply uncomfortable with the part our family had played. Like most Southerners, he was skilled at avoiding unpleasant conversations, and in the case of Briggs, events conspired to help him. For reasons that remain murky, the Supreme Court case came to be called Brown rather than Briggs, even though Briggs preceded Brown both alphabetically and temporally. So it was Brown v. Board of Education that was memorialized in the history textbooks, and our family name was spared association in the public mind with a racist cause.\nI won\xe2\x80\x99t pretend I\xe2\x80\x99m not grateful. But the fact that Brown has overshadowed Briggs has also meant that Mr. De Laine, the man who did more than anyone else to bring about school desegregation in South Carolina, has been too often forgotten. This month, with the blessing of his surviving children, Joseph De Laine Jr. and Ophelia De Laine Gona, my cousin Joe Elliott \xe2\x80\x94 Uncle Roddy\xe2\x80\x99s grandson \xe2\x80\x94 submitted a \n to the South Carolina legislature on behalf of 21 descendants and relatives of Roderick Miles Elliott (including me), asking the legislature to honor Mr. De Laine with a statue on the grounds of the State House in Columbia.\nIn a just world, the name of Joseph De Laine would already be familiar to South Carolinians. Mr. De Laine was a minister in the African Methodist Episcopal Church and a teacher in the Clarendon County public schools, where his wife, Mattie, also taught. Black schools in Clarendon County in the 1940s were in abysmal condition \xe2\x80\x94 dilapidated, poorly heated and woefully understaffed. Children had to walk miles to attend school, because the school board, led by Uncle Roddy, refused to provide a bus. It provided 30 buses for white children.\nMr. De Laine began organizing the parents of Clarendon County in 1947 and kept at it for the next seven years. When the Supreme Court finally vindicated his cause in 1954, it used the dissenting opinion in Briggs as the legal backbone for its decision.\nIn South Carolina, however, Mr. De Laine\xe2\x80\x99s courage and tenacity were punished. Both he and his wife lost their teaching jobs. When an arsonist set fire to the De Laine home, which stood 60 feet outside the city limits of Summerton, S.C., the all-white firefighting squad in Summerton stood by and watched it burn to the ground. Later, Mr. De Laine\xe2\x80\x99s church in Lake City was burned to the ground as well. He was eventually forced to leave the state in 1955 after defending his home against a group of armed attackers. Mr. De Laine died in Charlotte, N.C, in 1974.\nCongress awarded Mr. De Laine a Gold Medal in 2004 (along with the Briggs petitioners Levi Pearson and Harry and Eliza Briggs), but a comparable gesture of recognition has never been made in South Carolina. The state has no monuments to Mr. De Laine, and apart from a small interstate interchange near Summerton, no roads, bridges or public buildings bear his name.\nAsking South Carolina to honor Mr. De Laine might seem quixotic. It took decades of protest and the 2015 mass murder at Emanuel A.M.E. Church in Charleston before the Confederate flag came down from the South Carolina State House. Sixty-three years after Brown, schools in Summerton remain de facto segregated, thanks in part to a private academy favored by many white families. Change never comes easily in South Carolina, a state populated by stubborn iconoclasts who can be single-minded in the pursuit of hopeless causes. To which I say: This is exactly why we should honor Mr. De Laine. He showed us how to put that single-mindedness to work for the cause of righteousness.\nSchool desegregation is often seen as a tool for justice, and rightly so. But it is an equally powerful tool for friendship, love and solidarity. Most of my generation of South Carolinians had the privilege of attending the integrated schools that Uncle Roddy fought against. As a result, many of us have formed lasting relationships across racial lines in ways that would have been unimaginable to our Southern grandparents, both black and white. If we can somehow make our way together through these dark times, it will be in no small part because of the vision of Joseph De Laine.\n'

aS'San Francisco \xe2\x80\x94 Just five years ago, I sued Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, the venture capital firm in Silicon Valley where I had worked since 2005, for bias and gender discrimination. The lawsuit, which I lost, led to the venture capital world closing ranks against me. I had trouble finding work. People were afraid to support me publicly. I was called a fraud, and greedy, and was accused of being in a fake marriage.\nNow, over the past year, at least a dozen women have publicly shared their stories of being discriminated against and harassed in tech by their managers, by investors or by board members. Privately, I have heard dozens more.\nWhat I also hear, over and over again, is the question, \xe2\x80\x9cHas anything changed?\xe2\x80\x9d\nThe huge change is that people now acknowledge the problem. Women telling their stories are believed, for the most part, by the public and by the press. In February, with a clear and \n about her time at Uber, Susan Fowler blew open the doors on bad behavior in tech. She made deliberate choices that made her an unassailable commentator: no litigation, no P.R. firm and detailed descriptions of each incident left no room for a smear campaign or any question of impropriety. Her clear and precise retelling of the harassment and retaliation she said she suffered \xe2\x80\x94 and the failures of management to fix it \xe2\x80\x94 are now widely known.\nBefore her post, others who spoke up publicly and privately about their experiences of harassment were at best ignored. Some of those people \xe2\x80\x94 whose names are unfortunately not well known \xe2\x80\x94 include Adria Richards, Am\xc3\xa9lie Lamont, Gesche Haas, Julie Ann Horvath, Kathryn Minshew and Kelly Ellis. Most were disrespected and harassed online, and many found it hard, as I did, to find work after public shaming. We saw Gamergate attack female game developers and their supporters. But they all paved the way for Ms. Fowler to be heard and believed, and for subsequent stories about sexist tech culture to be accepted at face value.\nWhat followed Ms. Fowler\xe2\x80\x99s post was a first: a public overhaul of Uber; two investigations; a \n from Eric Holder, the former attorney general, with recommendations for improvement; the forced departures of at least 20 employees linked to the findings, including some executives; and the board\xe2\x80\x99s stating its intent to follow the report\xe2\x80\x99s recommendations. Many details were leaked or dug up \xe2\x80\x94 board conversations, a full audio recording of a conversation the former chief executive Travis Kalanick had with Uber\xe2\x80\x99s female engineers. More women stepped up to report harassment in tech by venture capital investors and board members.\nApologies have been free-flowing. Venture capitalists have made their mea culpas and the leaders of some well-known firms have resigned. One partner at Greylock even wrote a \xe2\x80\x9c\n\xe2\x80\x9d for the industry \xe2\x80\x94 and Greylock\xe2\x80\x99s C.O.O. was asked to resign shortly thereafter. Even Mr. Kalanick gave a tearful apology \xe2\x80\x94 around the same time his team\xe2\x80\x99s listening session with female engineers fell flat.\nWe\xe2\x80\x99re hearing about companies writing codes of conduct covering anti-harassment that they want their investors and board members to sign.\nOn its face, it all sounds like meaningful change, right? Or at least it sounds a lot better than the very recent public shaming of women who came forward and the sweeping of bad behavior under the rug. But let\xe2\x80\x99s not be blinded by optimism or biased by what we want to see: Certain actions, and lack of action, could keep us in this unfair loop indefinitely. Public apologies and one-off actions are superficial ways to react to criticism or put on a happy face, but they often cover up company culture failures that are hard to fix, especially if no one is seriously trying.\nMany continue to describe Uber and the outed venture capitalists as a few bad apples, not indicative of the entire industry \xe2\x80\x94 forgetting that the whole saying is actually \xe2\x80\x9cOne bad apple spoils the bunch.\xe2\x80\x9d Their behavior is part of much broader and deeper culture problems that permeate all tech \xe2\x80\x94 which ignored, encouraged and sometimes rewarded bad behavior \xe2\x80\x94 at different levels. We see companies changing C.E.O.s, but the reasons are shrouded, and they install new leaders with similar backgrounds.\nWe see bad actors resurface unscathed. Uber\xe2\x80\x99s Travis Kalanick \n have made a strong effort to return as C.E.O. \xe2\x80\x94 and \n apparently supported him. The ex-Google employee who was fired after he wrote a memo that promoted harmful gender stereotypes and questioned women\xe2\x80\x99s biological suitability for tech jobs has hired a lawyer who \n the company.\nI have heard from several women who spoke up in this newspaper and elsewhere this year that they continue to face harassment. They have been told that discussing their experiences has limited their careers.\nAnd most companies don\xe2\x80\x99t address the great underlying problems: the exclusion of and biases against people of color, older employees, disabled people, L.G.B.T.Q. people and many other underrepresented groups.\nThey continue to pay only lip service to diversity and inclusion, favoring tepid diversity initiatives over real solutions. It\xe2\x80\x99s all superficial until we see leaders actually changing company cultures by making hard decisions, leading uncomfortable conversations \xe2\x80\x94 and firing those who are unwilling to include everyone.\nSo how do we clear biases and power imbalances in tech so that everyone has a fair opportunity to succeed?\nWe need C.E.O.s to hold themselves and their teams accountable for true diversity and inclusion. That means all people from all groups, not just women. That means understanding intersectionality \xe2\x80\x94 that employees can face multiple biases based on identity. That means all activities across the company, not just hiring.\nPractically, it means measuring progress, holding people accountable for results by setting goals and basing their compensation on hitting those goals.\nC.E.O.s lead the transformation from the top, and they need individual employees to focus efforts on change as well: Speak up, help others speak up, build bridges to those who are interested in changing and learning. I know that there is a real cost to speaking up. I have also seen that every voice can make a difference. Five years from now, if enough people speak up for others, the answer to \xe2\x80\x9cHas anything changed?\xe2\x80\x9d has the potential to be an unequivocal yes.\n'

aS'THE decision by the Trump administration to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program and to defer instead to Congress for a solution to the problem threw a wild card onto a congressional agenda that was already packed. But far more important, it thrust the lives of roughly 800,000 of our friends and neighbors into instant uncertainty.\nWashington being Washington, the administration\xe2\x80\x99s decision and its confusing aftermath produced heated and generally unhelpful rhetoric from the extremes of both political parties. Having served as the Republican majority leader in the House of Representatives during the last major immigration debate, I understand the implications of this all too well.\nIn 2013, a year after the Obama administration established the DACA program, I announced that I was working on legislation to provide a more stable way forward for these so-called Dreamers: young people who had been brought into this country illegally as children and who knew no other home.\nAs we continued to gather support for the legislation and the 2014 election neared, protesters from both sides of the debate descended on Richmond, Va., my hometown, for dueling rallies. Those from the left attacked me for blocking comprehensive reform because of my focus on Dreamers, while my friends on the right claimed I was promoting an amnesty.\nI have long believed that America is a country of laws and that border security is paramount. I also firmly believe that the principles of our founding dictate that children should not be punished for the illegal acts of their parents. The Dreamers were not responsible for their situation, and as a compassionate nation and people we owed them our help: a legal process that could address their status effectively and permanently. But Congress was gridlocked and my proposal went nowhere.\nFast forward to today. The Trump administration has stated that the DACA program will end in six months unless Congress acts. What will Congress do?\nAs President Barack Obama himself acknowledged, DACA is an imperfect and temporary solution. Every two years Dreamers must renew their deferment from deportation and their work permit. And while DACA makes it possible for them to enroll in college, they remain barred from receiving federal financial aid. Even under DACA, the Dreamers never fully and legally integrate into our country.\nOnly Congress can fix this mess. It should do so by providing a path for law-abiding Dreamers to obtain a green card and ultimately, full citizenship.\nIn exchange for a much improved program for Dreamers, Congress should significantly increase America\xe2\x80\x99s border security by funding additional personnel, technology and physical resources at our border. While President Trump\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cwall\xe2\x80\x9d has gotten all the political attention, much of the border can be secured more quickly and efficiently by other means. In addition, Congress should require the institution of a comprehensive biometric entry-exit system to prevent visa overstays.\nFor Republicans, these measures are a critical first step before tackling broader immigration changes. Of course, this is the sort of deal that the extreme wings of both parties will oppose, but it is exactly the type of sensible compromise the nation needs.\nOver the past couple of days, we have heard that President Trump and some members of Congress are on the verge of such a compromise, only to later learn that there may not be a deal after all. It\xe2\x80\x99s hard to say exactly what is happening, but it seems safe to say that the president, congressional Democrats and congressional Republicans all have different ideas of what constitutes \xe2\x80\x9cprotecting the Dreamers\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9csecuring the border.\xe2\x80\x9d\nWatching this unfold, I was reminded of those dueling protests in my district three years ago, when I shook my head wondering how one group of people could call my proposal amnesty for illegal immigrants while another described the very same proposal as a step backward for illegal immigrants.\nI fear we are on the verge of the same thing happening again. Each day that passes without a deal increases the likelihood that Washington will ultimately do what it usually does: keep the status quo. At best, this would entail Congress authorizing the current DACA program with the same two-year renewals and uncertainty for Dreamers. In the meantime, Democrats and Republicans would continue to fight over border security with little or no progress to show for it.\nWhile keeping the status quo would protect the Dreamers from immediate deportation, it would represent a missed opportunity of tremendous proportions for them, for border security and for broader immigration reform.\nIt is well past time for Republicans to stand up to those on the right who are quick to denounce any sensible solution as amnesty and for Democrats to stand up to those on the left who rail against any meaningful steps toward border security and immigration enforcement.\nThe fate of the Dreamers presents a unique opportunity for both parties to do just that. If they do, we may well look back on this as the beginning of the end of the immigration wars.\n'

aS'Donald Trump almost never laughs. The leader of the free world frequently displays a tight-lipped smile, but mirth-wise, that is as far as he will go. Except for the fact that Nazis don\xe2\x80\x99t seem to mind him too much, Mr. Trump is the Captain von Trapp of commanders in chief.\nIt would be easy to dismiss this as a personality quirk. Some people are just hard laughs. Perhaps Mr. Trump is simply the hardest laugh of all. But the president\xe2\x80\x99s laughter, or lack thereof, is a window into the way he views the world\xe2\x80\x99s most difficult job. For the first time in recent memory, we have a commander in chief without a sense of humor \xe2\x80\x94 and America is paying the price.\nFor most presidents, humor is a tool for building bridges, especially with voters who may not be persuaded by their policy goals. When I wrote speeches for President Barack Obama, we would often open with a throwaway line, something about sports, the weather or the best barbecue joint in town. These were not exactly comedy gold. Still, they served a purpose. Even audience members who didn\xe2\x80\x99t vote for Mr. Obama could appreciate one of his harmless asides.\nThe presidential equivalent of dad jokes \xe2\x80\x94 safe, well-placed quips that crowds are well primed to laugh at \xe2\x80\x94 are a bipartisan Oval Office tradition. Presidents George W. Bush, Bill Clinton and especially Ronald Reagan knew how to use laugh lines to win over skeptics. On his way into the operating room after a 1981 assassination attempt, Mr. Reagan famously declared to his doctors, \xe2\x80\x9cPlease tell me you\xe2\x80\x99re all Republicans.\xe2\x80\x9d The head surgeon, a Democrat, replied, \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re all Republicans today.\xe2\x80\x9d Even at that moment, the president deftly cleared a patch of common ground.\nMr. Trump, to put it mildly, lacks this ability. With no talent for gracious one-liners, he finds himself ill at ease in front of all but the most adoring audiences. This is not to say that he is without charisma. The difference lies in the way his charisma is deployed. Surrounded by followers at rallies, he uses his well-honed sense of timing as a cudgel. He jeers. He mocks. His goal is to insult, rather than to entertain.\nIt should come as no surprise, then, that Mr. Trump governs the way he delivers a punch line: consolidating support among the hard core while alienating everybody else.\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s not only in front of a crowd that laughter matters. Whether in public or in private, politicians use humor to identify, and ultimately to uphold, unwritten norms. This is best explained using what the University of Colorado, Boulder\xe2\x80\x99s Peter McGraw, founder of the Humor Research Lab, has called \xe2\x80\x9cbenign violation theory.\xe2\x80\x9d We laugh when something breaks one of life\xe2\x80\x99s many rules. This is why, at the White House Correspondents\xe2\x80\x99 dinner, President Obama could chastise Republicans for failing to reach beyond their base (\xe2\x80\x9cCall me self-centered, but I can think of one minority they could start with\xe2\x80\x9d), or pretend to lose his cool over climate change deniers as \xe2\x80\x9cLuther, my anger translator\xe2\x80\x9d tried and failed to calm him down. By stepping up to the line without crossing it, a commander in chief tacitly acknowledges that a line exists.\nPresident Trump does not possess the sense of nuance a well-told joke requires. He does not seem to know when he is pushing the envelope. Even worse, he does not appear to realize that there \n an envelope. It\xe2\x80\x99s one thing, for example, to do an end-run around Washington reporters by appearing on \xe2\x80\x9cBetween Two Ferns\xe2\x80\x9d to promote your health care bill. It\xe2\x80\x99s another thing entirely to mock a disabled journalist or to suggest that Megyn Kelly asked a tough question because she had \xe2\x80\x9cblood coming out of her wherever.\xe2\x80\x9d\nThis refusal to recognize the unwritten rules that govern us, so evident during Mr. Trump\xe2\x80\x99s failed attempts at humor, is a central feature of his presidential tenure thus far. If a leader does not understand the idea of benign violations, blatant violations inevitably occur.\nHumor helps us recognize, and cope with, life\xe2\x80\x99s absurdities. While I certainly never asked him directly, I got the sense Mr. Obama appreciated that the modern American presidency is in many ways a fundamentally bizarre proposition. Commanders in chief must accept the responsibilities that come with holding the fate of the world at their fingertips, while simultaneously admitting that they are only human. Presidents can either laugh at the strangeness of their circumstances or be consumed by them.\nWithout the qualities that laughter both demonstrates and fosters \xe2\x80\x94 a willingness to find common ground, the respect for agreed-upon norms and the awareness that we are all only human \xe2\x80\x94 Mr. Trump\xe2\x80\x99s attitude toward the presidency is defined by the one characteristic that remains: a lust for power. And this is perhaps the most troubling thing about what passes for a sense of humor with Mr. Trump. Thanks to the power of the internet, there is proof that our president has indeed laughed at least once. This was during a campaign rally in January, when Mr. Trump\xe2\x80\x99s speech was interrupted by a barking dog.\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s Hillary!\xe2\x80\x9d an audience member shouted. And the candidate tilted his head back, opened his mouth wide and laughed without reservation, quite possibly for the first time in his political life.\nThis documented incidence of Trump laughter is as illuminating as all the grim smiles that preceded it. For they reveal a president who is constantly, endlessly preoccupied with status. A craving for power isn\xe2\x80\x99t unique to the politician currently holding the Oval Office \xe2\x80\x94 on the contrary, it is more or less a requirement for entry into the field. But a craving \n for power is.\nIt is not too late to undo the damage our humorless president is causing to American democracy. Democrats (and some Republicans, these days) are already thinking about who might replace him in 2020. And if there is one thing all Americans should be able to agree on, it is this: Whomever we nominate to replace President Trump, it is time to put an easy laugh back on top of the ticket.\n'

aS'When I was 21, I went into the office of a producer of the television show I was starring in to discuss a big problem. By this point I had been acting for more than a decade, and the show was very successful and beloved. Still, I was nervous about facing the firing squad of Emmys that sat behind him and saying what I had to say.\nA crew member had kept showing up to my apartment after work unannounced, going into my trailer while I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t in it, and staring daggers at me from across the set. I liked him at first. He was very sweet and kind in the beginning. We flirted a bit on set. But I was in a relationship. And liking someone certainly didn\xe2\x80\x99t merit the kind of behavior he was exhibiting, which was making me feel unsafe.\nMy hands were freezing and I balled my wardrobe skirt up around my fists as I spoke. It was all caught in my throat \xe2\x80\x94 my embarrassment that it had gotten to this point. The producer listened. Then he said, \xe2\x80\x9cWell, there are two sides to every story.\xe2\x80\x9d\nFor women in America who come forward with stories of harassment, abuse and sexual assault, there are not two sides to every story, however noble that principle might seem. Women do not get to have a side. They get to have an interrogation. Too often, they are questioned mercilessly about whether their side is legitimate. Especially if that side happens to accuse a man of stature, then that woman has to consider the scrutiny and repercussions she\xe2\x80\x99ll be subjected to by sharing her side.\nEvery day, women across the country consider the risks. That is our day job and our night shift. We have a diploma in risk consideration. Consider that skirt. Consider that dark alley. Consider questioning your boss. Consider what your daughter will think of you. Consider what your mother will think of what your daughter will think of you. Consider how it will be twisted and used against you in a court of law. Consider whether you did, perhaps, really ask for it. Consider your weight. Consider dieting. Consider agelessness. Consider silence.\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s no wonder that the \nreported that from 2006 to 2010, 65 percent of sexual assaults went unreported. What\xe2\x80\x99s the point, if you won\xe2\x80\x99t be believed?\nI use Twitter to follow the news, sigh with jealousy over posts from Beyonc\xc3\xa9 highlighting her gorgeous skin, and plug events I\xe2\x80\x99m doing. On occasion, a comment will seem so misogynistic that I feel compelled to say something.\nThat happened this past week when a conversation about my friend Armie Hammer\xe2\x80\x99s forthcoming film \xe2\x80\x94 in which a 24-year-old and 17-year-old have a relationship \xe2\x80\x94 escalated, as things can on Twitter, I guess, into a discussion with the actor James Woods about what is appropriate behavior in terms of an adult dating someone underage. Mr. Woods spoke critically, if flippantly, of the story depicted in the film. Mr. Woods has been known to date much younger women, so Armie pointed out the hypocrisy.\nIn an instant, I was reminded of a memory from when I was 16. Mr. Woods attempted to pick me and a friend up when we were at Mel\xe2\x80\x99s diner in Hollywood, seeing if we wanted to go to Las Vegas with him that very night. I informed him of my age, to which he said, \xe2\x80\x9cEven better.\xe2\x80\x9d I told this story publicly as a way to back up the claim that Mr. Woods was, indeed, a hypocrite. Mr. Woods called my account a \n.\nWhat would I get out of accusing this person of such an action, almost 20 years after the fact? Notoriety, power or respect? I am more than confident with my quota of all three. Even then, why would I choose the guy from \xe2\x80\x9cScary Movie 2\xe2\x80\x9d to help my stature when I\xe2\x80\x99m already married to\n from \xe2\x80\x9cScary Movie 2\xe2\x80\x9d?\nThe emotional cost alone of bringing up such memories publicly or coming forward with such recollections is pure bankruptcy. It is spiritual foreclosure.\nMr. Woods\xe2\x80\x99s accusation that I was lying sent me back to that day in that producer\xe2\x80\x99s office, and back to all the days I\xe2\x80\x99ve spent in the offices of men; of feeling unsure, uneasy, questioned and disbelieved, no matter the conversation.\nI am part of a text chain of several incredible women \xe2\x80\x94 comedians, writers and actresses \xe2\x80\x94 that was formed after Election Day last year. We needed a space to vent, to cry, to dream about starting a commune with Hillary Clinton and anthropomorphizing Tom Hardy into a dreamy horse we could ride into the sunset. We needed a space to give one another supportive, strong advice.\nOne of the women on the chain talked about her fear of asking for the opportunity to direct. She said that she\xe2\x80\x99d taken days to figure out exactly how she was going to ask for permission. Even after she got the directing gig, she was filled with anxiety that perhaps she wasn\xe2\x80\x99t capable.\nDisbelief is not just about men disbelieving us. It is about our own disbelief in ourselves.\nI have been afraid of speaking out or asking things of men in positions of power for years. What I have experienced as an actress working in a business whose business is to objectify women is frightening. It is the deep end of a pool where I cannot swim. It is a famous man telling you that you are a liar for what you have remembered. For what you \n have misremembered, unless you have proof.\nThe women I know, myself included, are done, though, playing the credentials game. We are learning that the more we open our mouths, the more we become a choir. And the more we are a choir, the more the tune is forced to change.\n'

aS'In August 1965, a resolute President Lyndon Johnson said: \xe2\x80\x9cAmerica wins the wars that she undertakes. Make no mistake about it.\xe2\x80\x9d But the strategy on which he committed America to its ill-fated intervention in Vietnam that year did not aim at winning, but at not losing. McGeorge Bundy, Johnson\xe2\x80\x99s national security adviser, later admitted as much to a biographer, saying that he had personally approved a strategy that used just enough military pressure to achieve a battlefield stalemate, which \xe2\x80\x9cwould eventually compel the Vietnamese Communists to compromise their objectives,\xe2\x80\x9d forcing them to the negotiating table or to a Korea-style armistice.\nBundy added that his strategy rested, in hindsight, on \xe2\x80\x9clittle more than an unexamined assumption.\xe2\x80\x9d The same might be said of President Trump\xe2\x80\x99s newest policy on Afghanistan. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said that the strategy, which commits a few thousand more troops, was \xe2\x80\x9cintended to put pressure on the Taliban.\xe2\x80\x9d The idea, he said, was \xe2\x80\x9cto have the Taliban understand, you will not win a battlefield victory \xe2\x80\x94 we may not win one, but neither will you \xe2\x80\x94 so at some point, we have to come to the negotiating table and find a way to bring this to an end.\xe2\x80\x9d\nThere are two great lessons of Vietnam that the Trump administration might bear in mind before attempting to reprise the stalemate strategy that so conspicuously failed in the earlier conflict.\nThe first was formulated by a rueful Bundy, many years after the end of the Vietnam War: \xe2\x80\x9cWe ought not to ever be in a position where we are deciding, or undertaking to decide, or even trying to influence the internal power structure\xe2\x80\x9d of another country, he told his biographer, Gordon M. Goldstein. George Kennan, the historian and former diplomat, came to the same conclusion long before Bundy. In the Fulbright hearings on Vietnam in February 1966, he stated, \xe2\x80\x9cOur country should not be asked, and should not ask of itself, to shoulder the main burden of determining the political realities in any other country.\xe2\x80\x9d\nDid President Trump learn that lesson? In his Aug. 21 speech announcing the policy, he said: \xe2\x80\x9cWe are a partner and a friend, but we will not dictate to the Afghan people how to live or how to govern their own complex society. We are not nation-building again. We are killing terrorists.\xe2\x80\x9d But actions matter more than words, and a strategy based on an indefinite stalemate requires precisely what Mr. Trump says he rejects: propping up an Afghan government that cannot survive unaided for a prolonged period of time.\nAnd in fact, nation-building is exactly what America is doing in Afghanistan, as the foreign policy expert \n to the country. Only instead of \xe2\x80\x9cnation-building,\xe2\x80\x9d he heard commanders use terms like \xe2\x80\x9ccapacity-building,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cenabling\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cworking by, through and with.\xe2\x80\x9d One could hark back to the hopeful reports of democracy-building in Vietnam in 1967, as President Nguyen Van Thieu began consolidating his military-based rule with a flawed election, carried out mainly at the insistence of the United States.\nThis brings us to the second lesson of Vietnam, articulated by Henry Kissinger at the end of 1968 in a famous Foreign Affairs essay: A denial strategy cannot in itself produce victory, especially in a conflict involving insurgents. \xe2\x80\x9cWe fought a military war; our opponents fought a political one,\xe2\x80\x9d he wrote. \xe2\x80\x9cWe sought physical attrition; our opponents aimed for our psychological exhaustion. In the process we lost sight of one of the cardinal maxims of guerrilla war: The guerrilla wins if he does not lose. The conventional army loses if it does not win.\xe2\x80\x9d\nMany years later, Mr. Kissinger, who became Richard Nixon\xe2\x80\x99s national security adviser, connected this conclusion with an additional point: America\xe2\x80\x99s inability to \xe2\x80\x9cwin\xe2\x80\x9d in Vietnam by producing a decisive outcome rendered the stalemate strategy of \xe2\x80\x9cnot losing\xe2\x80\x9d ineffective. He no doubt took pleasure in ascribing the fallacy to his rival and predecessor, Bundy.\n\xe2\x80\x9cStalemate violates the maxim that the guerrilla wins if he does not lose,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Kissinger told Newsweek in 2008. \xe2\x80\x9cHanoi\xe2\x80\x99s leaders had fought a decade against France and battled the United States for a similar length of time, not to achieve a political compromise, but to prevail.\xe2\x80\x9d In other words, a stalemate strategy against an ideologically motivated, insurgent-driven enemy is doomed to fail.\nThere\xe2\x80\x99s a corollary: Stalemate strategies that don\xe2\x80\x99t show rapid progress will soon eat away at public and domestic political support. Indeed, by 1967 the news media and a growing number of politicians were debating whether or not the Vietnam War was stalemated \xe2\x80\x94 overlooking, or disregarding, the fact that this was precisely the Johnson administration\xe2\x80\x99s goal. Nor was it simply a matter of bad communication: Stalemate might have made sense to Bundy, but no one in the White House or Pentagon thought it made for good P.R. And so even as the White House and the Pentagon pursued a stalemate strategy in Vietnam, at home they insisted that progress toward a conventional victory was close at hand.\nGen. William Westmoreland, who oversaw the American war effort from Saigon, was brought back to Washington twice in 1967 to reassure Congress and the American people. But his promotional efforts served only to amplify the shock of the Tet offensive in early 1968, which led Walter Cronkite, after a visit to Vietnam during the fighting, to announce, \xe2\x80\x9cTo say that we are mired in stalemate seems the only realistic, if unsatisfactory conclusion.\xe2\x80\x9d\nThis same disconnect in strategy, rhetoric and reality confronts us today. If stalemate and nation-building are the goals in Afghanistan, but the American public is led to expect a victory, then it is only a matter of time before the entire edifice collapses. And when it does, we might face the same conclusion that Cronkite drew after touring Vietnam: \xe2\x80\x9cIt is increasingly clear to this reporter that the only rational way out then will be to negotiate, not as victors, but as an honorable people who lived up to their pledge to defend democracy, and did the best they could.\xe2\x80\x9d\n'

aS'Comedy is hard. Anyone who has performed for three people in the back of a juice bar, trying to land a punch line over the whir of a blender full of kale (for example) can vouch for that.\nRight now, no one understands this more than the disgraced pharmaceutical executive and cartoon villain come to life, Martin Shkreli. Mr. Shkreli, who is waiting sentencing for a fraud conviction, was thrown in jail last week after a federal judge deemed him a \xe2\x80\x9cdanger to society.\xe2\x80\x9d Her evidence was a Facebook post that Mr. Shkreli wrote on Sept. 4:\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn H.R.C.\xe2\x80\x99s book tour, try to grab a hair from her,\xe2\x80\x9d he wrote, referring to the former secretary of state. \xe2\x80\x9cWill pay $5,000 per hair obtained from Hillary Clinton.\xe2\x80\x9d\nMr. Shkreli and his attorney tried to explain that it was just a joke!

aS'The electric talent Sloane Stephens, a player just now coming into her own after having her career nearly wrecked by injuries, won the U.S. Open women\xe2\x80\x99s tournament last week. But let\xe2\x80\x99s not kid ourselves: The real winner of this year\xe2\x80\x99s tournament was Serena Williams.\nMore specifically, \n. From the shots of her baby shower to her glorious pregnant belly and finally an adorable shot of mother and child dozing together, Williams \nthe Open. The only tennis story bigger this entire year was a seven-months-pregnant Williams smashing backhands in a video posted during Wimbledon. (Pity her poor sister, Venus: She couldn\xe2\x80\x99t even enjoy her own run to the Wimbledon finals without having announcers tell us how \n she must be by Serena\xe2\x80\x99s impending motherhood.)\nSurely, this is a step forward from years past, when female athletes had to end their careers for childbirth or were discouraged from playing when pregnant. Motherhood is now even part of female athletes\xe2\x80\x99 heartwarming hero narratives, like Kim Clijsters and Lindsay Davenport in tennis, and the married W.N.B.A. players DeWanna Bonner and Candice Dupree, who are raising twin daughters together despite being on different teams.\nIn this area \xe2\x80\x94 the recognition of a full life off the playing field, the acceptance that our athletes don\xe2\x80\x99t materialize out of thin air when they step on the field \xe2\x80\x94 male athletes fall short of their female counterparts. They remain stat-generating robots who exist solely to make our teams win: Their off-field lives aren\xe2\x80\x99t just irrelevant to us, they\xe2\x80\x99re annoying distractions from what really matters.\nColin Kaepernick\xe2\x80\x99s protest and subsequent blackballing by the N.F.L. is the most high-profile example. But our insistence that male athletes keep their lives to themselves isn\xe2\x80\x99t limited to their political views. Every time a male athlete takes a few days off for the birth of his child, he\xe2\x80\x99s inevitably showered with \xe2\x80\x9cWhere are his priorities?\xe2\x80\x9d complaints from fans and sports columnists. (\xe2\x80\x9cIf they choose not to plan their nine-month family expansion activities to coincide with the eight months per year when their work activities don\xe2\x80\x99t entail playing games that count, why should their teams suffer the consequences?\xe2\x80\x9d Mike Florio at NCB \n, succinctly summing up the mind-set in 2012.)\nPlayers who have taken time off to deal with mental health problems are seen as weak or somehow not \xe2\x80\x9cfocused\xe2\x80\x9d enough to overcome them. \xe2\x80\x9cTo show weakness, we\xe2\x80\x99re told in sports, is to deserve shame,\xe2\x80\x9d the former tennis star Mardy Fish, who withdrew from a 2012 U.S. Open match against Roger Federer because of anxiety, \n USA Today\nEmotional states in male athletes can even be mostly ignored or given more \xe2\x80\x9ccomfortable\xe2\x80\x9d explanations. Stephen Piscotty, a right fielder for my beloved St. Louis Cardinals, has had a disappointing year at the plate. A logical reason for this might be that early in the season his mother was told she had A.L.S. But Piscotty\xe2\x80\x99s struggles have not been attributed to that. Instead, \xe2\x80\x9chis timing is off\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9che\xe2\x80\x99s just having one of those years\xe2\x80\x9d is the preferred nomenclature.\nAnd compare, say, Novak Djokovic and Venus Williams. Djokovic, one of the best tennis players of all time, has had the worst year of his career, falling below No. 2 in the rankings for the first time since 2011 and prompting John McEnroe to question his desire. He left the tour in July to rest his elbow and \xe2\x80\x9cspend quality time\xe2\x80\x9d with his family.\nWe\xe2\x80\x99ve grown accustomed to dismissing that as news release talk, but it turned out that his wife \n at the beginning of September. Few even knew she was pregnant, or even thought to ask. Surely this had something to do with Djokovic\xe2\x80\x99s year?\nAt the U.S. Open, commentators kept telling me that Venus Williams was playing great tennis because she was inspired by her sister\xe2\x80\x99s having a child. I think she was playing at that level because she\xe2\x80\x99s one of the greatest athletes on the planet and has the competitive streak to match.\nWhen I hear a commentator note that a male athlete is affected in any possible way by his sister\xe2\x80\x99s having a child somewhere thousands of miles away, it will be a first. This disparity is ultimately infantilizing of female athletes, patting them on the head for off-field stories, as if their on-court accomplishments aren\xe2\x80\x99t enough. And while we can\xe2\x80\x99t stop talking about Venus Williams\xe2\x80\x99s off-court life, we rarely think to ask about Novak Djokovic\xe2\x80\x99s.\nWe\xe2\x80\x99d rather our male athletes not have emotional lives, but if they have to have them, we\xe2\x80\x99d rather not know about it.\nPerhaps it\xe2\x80\x99s indicative of a larger need to pretend that sports are somehow separate from real life, as if our athletes have no interior lives but simply appear when we as sports fans beckon them. Why is it more pronounced for male athletes than female athletes? It might be because there are (slightly) more male sports fans than female sports fans \xe2\x80\x94 66 percent of men are sports fans, 51 percent of women, in a 2015 \n \xe2\x80\x94 and, well, male sports fans usually watch more male athletes than female athletes. The more sports you watch, the less perspective you have, and the more likely you are to see an athlete more as a stat producer (or a key producer for your team, or the guy likely to win you gambling money) than as a human being. Women are allowed to have off-field lives that affect their on-field ones because male fans simply care about those sports less.\nBut there is much evidence that that is changing: Women\xe2\x80\x99s tennis television ratings are often better than men\xe2\x80\x99s, the United States women\xe2\x80\x99s soccer team got the highest ratings in American soccer history in 2015, and the W.N.B.A. finals notched their highest ratings last year. Women\xe2\x80\x99s sports are more popular than they have ever been, and that growth continues exponentially.\nWhich points to a potential evolution in attitudes. It\xe2\x80\x99s not difficult to imagine a time when this odd condescension ends and male sports fans are just as unreasonable about Serena Williams\xe2\x80\x99s taking time off to have a child as they are when a male athlete does the same for his child\xe2\x80\x99s birth. Don\xe2\x80\x99t mess up their fantasy tennis teams, Serena. Progress expresses itself in the strangest ways sometimes.\n'

aS'My cousin Mario, who lives in Certaldo, Italy, north of Florence, is a retired barber who hunts white truffles. One year when we joined him on a hunt, Mario gave my father a truffle about the size of an almond, which he dropped into the inside pocket of an old bomber jacket. On the train ride back to Florence, that tiny truffle filled the car with an extraordinary scent, an intoxicating, slightly nasty and wholly seductive mixture of garlic and lilies and dirty socks.\nThroughout dinner that evening my father, who was in his 80s, kept opening his jacket to sniff. Indeed, as we crossed the Ponte Vecchio in Florence on the way back to our hotel, he stopped a pair of tourists from Wisconsin. \xe2\x80\x9cYou want to smell something special?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked, opening his jacket. \xe2\x80\x9cSmell this! Come on, smell it!\xe2\x80\x9d\nThey didn\xe2\x80\x99t seem keen on sticking their noses into my father\xe2\x80\x99s sleeve, but that was O.K. \xe2\x80\x94 we all could smell the truffle from three feet away.\nIt is a truly heady perfume, but a transient one. In the case of the white truffle of Italy, the aromatic compounds, which may be weakened by bacterial symbionts that live on the truffle, start to degrade after about four days. By the time we had moved on to Rome a few days later, the truffle didn\xe2\x80\x99t smell like much at all. Maybe a very old mothball.\nHere in the United States, bottling the truffle has become big business. In May, \nfiled in New York and California accused Trader Joe\xe2\x80\x99s, Urbani Truffles, Sabatino and Monini of fraud of \xe2\x80\x9cfalse, misleading, and deceptive misbranding\xe2\x80\x9d of its truffle oil products. If you look at the labels of these brands\xe2\x80\x99 truffle oils, you\xe2\x80\x99ll find that the ingredients include truffle \xe2\x80\x9caroma\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cflavor\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cessence.\xe2\x80\x9d That\xe2\x80\x99s the chemical 2,4-dithiapentane. Also known as bis (methylthio) methane, it supplies a fair imitation of the natural truffle smell.\nThese lawsuits argue that the consumer is unlikely to know that \xe2\x80\x9cflavor\xe2\x80\x9d doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean fungus. \xe2\x80\x9cIn the law, you can advertise something honestly,\xe2\x80\x9d Bonnie Paton of the nonprofit organization Truth in Advertising told me, \xe2\x80\x9cand it still can be considered deceptive marketing because the reasonable consumer is not an expert in this area.\xe2\x80\x9d A reasonable consumer, she told me, would assume that these products actually contained truffles.\nEver since Jeffrey Steingarten broke the story in\n in 2003, it has been common knowledge among aficionados that truffle oil is typically synthetically flavored. But dubious truffle oil products have proliferated. For instance, Walmart now sells Roland Extra Virgin Olive Oil With White Truffle. Its 1.86 ounces, about the equivalent volume of an egg, cost $18. On its ingredient list: \xe2\x80\x9ctruffle aroma.\xe2\x80\x9d\nMy cousin Maria, the truffle hunter\xe2\x80\x99s wife, used to make truffle oil with the broken bits of truffle she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t serve, but not to preserve the flavor \xe2\x80\x94 the oil was flavorful for only as long as a fresh truffle. Much as we may want to capture truffles in a jar, the biology isn\xe2\x80\x99t accommodating.\nTruffle oil is just one of the products that take advantage of buyers\xe2\x80\x99 ignorance. Many truffle butter products are flavored with a Marmite-like substance called hydrated vegetable protein. Face creams touting probiotics confuse the mind with scientific-sounding jargon, like \xe2\x80\x9cbeneficial biotilys probiotic technology.\xe2\x80\x9d But not everyone thinks to check the claims of every product they buy.\nIn August, a federal judge in New York d\n. (The other three cases are pending.) As the judge, Louis Stanton, wrote, \xe2\x80\x9cCourts routinely conclude that where a product describes itself as substance-flavored despite not containing the actual substance, and the ingredient list truthfully reflects that fact, as a matter of law the product would not confuse a reasonable consumer acting reasonably under the circumstances, and thus does not sustain a consumer fraud claim.\xe2\x80\x9d\nIn other words, buyer beware. Or take a biology class before you shop.\n'

aS" The Latest on tropical weather (all times local):\n11:30 a.m.\nA tropical storm warning has been issued for a stretch of New England as Hurricane Jose approaches the coast of the U.S. Northeast.\nNational Hurricane Center in Miami said the warning was in effect for an area stretching from Watch Hill, Rhode Island, to Hull, Massachusetts. The storm is expected to remain offshore, although coastal flooding is possible from Delaware to southern New England over the next few days.\nThe center says little change in strength is expected in the next 24 hours, although the storm will slowly weaken afterward. Maximum sustained winds Monday are near 75 mph (120 kph) with higher gusts.\nJose is expected to produce total rain accumulations of 3 to 5 inches over eastern Long Island, southeast Connecticut, southern Rhode Island, and southeast Massachusetts, including Martha's Vineyard and Nantucket, through Wednesday.\n"

aS' It was, not surprisingly, a night for politics, with everyone from host Stephen Colbert to Lily Tomlin, Jane Fonda and Alec Baldwin getting in zingers about Donald Trump \xe2\x80\x94 all to be upstaged by Sean Spicer himself, in a controversial appearance that set social media afire. But Emmy night was not only about politics.\nIt was also about diversity and new voices, with notable wins, among others, for Sterling K. Brown, the first black actor in nearly 20 years to win for lead actor in a drama; for Lena Waithe, the first black woman to win for comedy writing, and Donald Glover, the first black director to win the comedy award (and best actor, too.)  Riz Ahmed\'s acting win was also first for Asian men. Stories about women won big: "Big Little Lies," \'\'The Handmaid\'s Tale" and "Veep" won the top three categories. But there was a notable paucity of Latino and Asian winners.\nSome notable moments:\nYES, THAT WAS REALLY HIM\nColbert had been hitting on Trump early and often in his opening monologue, but there were gasps of genuine shock in the crowd when he called out for "Sean," and the former White House press secretary wheeled a podium onstage to spoof his highly dubious claims on Trump\'s behalf about the inauguration crowd size. "This will be the largest audience to witness an Emmys period," he announced in faux seriousness, "both in person and around the world." There were plenty of laughs, but on Twitter, many questioned whether Spicer should have been there at all. "congrats to @seanspicer for his new job as the punchline to an unfunny joke," wrote Dan Pfeiffer, one of President Barack Obama\'s former aides.\nA BIG WIN \xe2\x80\x94 AND THEN A MIC CUT \xe2\x80\x94 FOR STERLING K. BROWN\nA year after winning in a different category for playing Christopher Darden, Brown became the first black actor in 19 years to win the top drama series trophy, for "This Is Us." He paid tribute to the last African-American man to win the category, Andre Braugher, and also saluted his castmates, "the best white family a brother could have." The emotional moment was marred by the unfortunate decision to cut Brown\'s speech short, a particularly sour note on a night that celebrated so many diverse voices. Waithe, who shared the best comedy writing award with "Master of None" co-creator Aziz Ansari, expressed gratitude to Emmy voters: "Thank you for embracing a little Indian boy from South Carolina and a little queer black girl from the south side of Chicago." And Ahmed became the first Asian man to win an acting Emmy for his role in "The Night Of," for which he won best actor in a limited series or movie.\nA \'9 TO 5\' REUNION BECOMES A TRUMP ROAST\nPerhaps the most biting Trump commentary came, unexpectedly, from the crowd-pleasing reunion of Dolly Parton, Fonda and Tomlin, stars of the 1980 hit movie "9 to 5." Fonda declared that back then, the women refused "to be controlled by a sexist, egotistical, lying, hypocritical bigot" (their boss in the film.) To which Tomlin quickly added, to huge cheers: "In 2017 we STILL refuse to be controlled by a sexist, egotistical, lying hypocritical bigot." Parton, for her part, chose to joke about her hope of getting a "Grace & Frankie" vibrator in her swag bag.\nSTORIES ABOUT WOMEN RULE\nWinning the limited series award for "Big Little Lies," co-producers and stars Reese Witherspoon and Nicole Kidman issued a call for more meaty, important roles for women. "Bring women to the front of their own stories," Witherspoon said. "More great roles for women, please!" said Kidman (who also won for acting in the hugely popular series.)  The winning shows in the other two major categories also featured women\'s stories: "The Handmaid\'s Tale," and "Veep." Backstage, Elisabeth Moss, who won the drama acting prize, said "incredible progress" has been made, but "there\'s still a lot of work to be done. There are still meetings you walk into and wonder if they say \'no,\' because it\'s a show by or about a woman." And comedy actress winner Julia Louis-Dreyfus said she hoped "this is the beginning of something even better in our country, and the world. I think the world would be a better place if more women were in charge."\n\'SNL\' HAS A GOOD NIGHT\n"Saturday Night Live," like the nighttime talk shows, has capitalized on the 2016 election to huge success. Lorne Michaels, accepting the variety sketch series award, recalled how when the show won an Emmy in 1976, "I remember thinking ... there would never be another season as crazy, as unpredictable, as frightening, as exhausting, or as exhilarating. Turns out I was wrong." Kate McKinnon, who won as supporting actress in a comedy, paid tribute to Hillary Clinton \xe2\x80\x94 whom she memorably played \xe2\x80\x94 for her "grace and grit." Baldwin, who won for his Trump portrayal, spoke directly to Trump: "I suppose I should say, \'At long last, Mr. President, here is your Emmy.\'"\nIN MEMORIAM SNUBS\nIt always seems to happen: There\'s a major omission in the memorial segment, and social media notices right away. This time, it was actor Harry Dean Stanton, who died Friday at age 91, and comedians Dick Gregory and Charlie Murphy. "Thinking of my brothers Dick Gregory + Charlie Murphy," tweeted rapper Common, after the snub. "I\'ll never forget you. I miss you both."\n'

aS' Salmon have a lousy problem, and the race to solve it is spanning the globe.\nA surge of parasitic sea lice is disrupting salmon farms around the world. The tiny lice attach themselves to salmon and feed on them, killing or rendering them unsuitable for dinner tables.\nMeanwhile, wholesale prices of salmon are way up, as high as 50 percent last year. That means higher consumer prices for everything from salmon fillets and steaks to more expensive lox on bagels.\nThe lice are actually tiny crustaceans that have infested salmon farms in the U.S., Canada, Scotland, Norway and Chile, major suppliers of the high-protein, heart-healthy fish. Scientists and fish farmers are working on new ways to control the pests, which Fish Farmer Magazine stated last year costs the global aquaculture industry about $1 billion annually.\nSo far it has been an uphill struggle that is a threat to a way of life in countries where salmon farming is a part of the culture.\n"Our work has to be quicker than the evolution of the lice," said Jake Elliott, vice president of Cooke Aquaculture in Blacks Harbour, New Brunswick.\nExperts say defeating the lice will take a suite of new and established technology, including older management tools such as pesticides and newer strategies such as breeding for genetic resistance. The innovative solutions in use or development include bathing the salmon in warm water to remove lice and zapping the lice with underwater lasers.\nFarmers worldwide consider sea lice the biggest threat to their industry and say the persistent problem is making the fish more expensive to consumers. Farmed salmon was worth nearly $12 billion in 2015, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations.\nThe only hope is to develop new methods to control the spread of lice, which are present in the wild, but thrive in the tightly packed ocean pens for fish farming, said Shawn Robinson, a scientist with the Canadian Department of Fisheries and Oceans.\n"There are not enough tools right now to allow the farmer to really effectively deal with it," Robinson said.\nThe lice can grow to about the size of a pea and lay thousands of eggs in their brief lifetime. The chance of a louse making its way to a diner\'s plate is very small because salmon are checked for lice before being sent to market. But even if one did, eating it wouldn\'t pose a health threat.\nAtlantic salmon have held their own with sea lice in the wild for centuries, and fish farmers managed them in aquaculture environments for many years. Then, farmers in Canada identified the lice as a problem around 1994, said Jonathan Carr, executive director of research and environment with the Atlantic Salmon Federation.\nFeeding fish a pesticide with the active ingredient of emamectin benzoate became the tool of choice to control lice, Carr said. But around 2009, the lice appeared to become resistant to the pesticide, and they have spread globally since.\nThe industry\'s key mistake was reacting when the lice evolved to survive pesticide, Carr said, rather than "getting ahead in the game."\n"The efficacy went away and pressure developed to create new treatments," said Kris Nicholls, chief operating officer at Cooke, a major player in world salmon farming.\nThe worldwide supply of salmon fell almost 10 percent last year, with Norway, the largest producer in the world, especially hard hit. In Norway, there are hundreds of times more salmon in aquaculture than in the wild. And the fish potentially can escape their pens with lice attached and introduce them to wild fish.\nNorwegian farmers are looking to use new closed-in pens that resemble giant eggs instead of typical mesh pens. Scottish farmers have deployed a device known as a Thermolicer to warm the water and detach the lice from fish. And farmers in North America and Europe are experimenting with using species of "cleaner fish" to coexist with the salmon and eat the lice.\nResearch about farming salmon along with mussels, which researchers have found will eat larval sea lice, is underway. Underwater drones inhabit the other end of the technological spectrum, zapping lice with lasers to kill them. That technology was developed in Norway and has been used there and in Scotland.\nCooke keeps a brood stock of fish in the hopes of breeding them for desirable traits such as disease resistance. And the company uses a pair of boats capable of pumping 10,000 fish at a time into a hydrogen peroxide bath, which kills most of the lice, although it also can stress and kill some fish.\nOn the shores of Beaver Harbour, New Brunswick, Cooke engineer Joel Halse stood recently aboard a $4 million vessel containing a series of tubes that send 300 salmon a minute on a winding journey while dousing them with warm water to remove lice.\nHalse, who likened it to a "waterslide park" for fish, said the fish farming industry has no choice but to try such innovations.\n"The cost to the salmon farming industry from sea lice is huge," he said. "And having tools to control the population would be huge."\n'

aS' President Donald Trump made his debut at the United Nations on Monday, using his first moments at the world body to urge the 193-nation organization to reduce bureaucracy and costs while more clearly defining its mission around the world.\nBut while Trump chastised the United Nations \xe2\x80\x94 an organization he sharply criticized as a candidate for president for its spiraling costs \xe2\x80\x94 he said the United States would "pledge to be partners in your work" in order to make the U.N. "a more effective force" for peace across the globe.\n"In recent years, the United Nations has not reached its full potential due to bureaucracy and mismanagement," said Trump, who rebuked the United Nations for a ballooning budget. "We are not seeing the results in line with this investment."\nThe president pushed the U.N. to focus "more on people and less on bureaucracy" and to change "business as usual and not be beholden to ways of the past which were not working" while also suggesting that the United States was paying more than its fair share to keep the New York-based world body operational.\nBut he also complimented the steps the United Nations had taken in the early stages of the reform process and made no threats to withdraw his nation\'s support. His measured tone stood in stark contrast to his last maiden appearance at a global body, when he stood at NATO\'s new Brussels headquarters in May and scolded the member nations for not paying enough and refusing to explicitly back its mutual defense pact.\nWhile running for office, Trump labeled the U.N. as weak and incompetent, and not a friend of either the United States or Israel. But he has softened his tone since taking office, telling ambassadors from U.N. Security Council member countries at a White House meeting this year that the U.N. has "tremendous potential."\nTrump more recently has praised a pair of unanimous council votes to tighten sanctions on North Korea over its continued nuclear weapon and ballistic missile tests.\nTrump\'s big moment comes Tuesday, when he delivers his first address to a session of the U.N. General Assembly. The annual gathering of world leaders will open amid serious concerns about Trump\'s priorities, including his policy of "America First," his support for the U.N. and a series of global crises. It will be the first time world leaders will be in the same room and able to take the measure of Trump.\nThe president on Monday praised U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, who also spoke at the reform meeting and said he shared Trump\'s vision for a less wasteful U.N. to "live up to its full potential." The U.S. has asked member nations to sign a declaration on U.N. reforms, and more than 120 have done so. The president also kicked off his maiden speech at the world body by making a reference to the Trump-branded apartment tower across First Ave. from the U.N.\nNikki Haley, the U.S. ambassador to the U.N., said Trump\'s criticisms were accurate at the time, but that it is now a "new day" at the U.N. An organization that "talked a lot but didn\'t have a lot of action" has given way to a "United Nations that\'s action-oriented," she said, noting the Security Council votes on North Korea this month.\nGuterres has proposed a massive package of changes, and Haley said the U.N. is "totally moving toward reform."\nTrump also planned to hold separate talks Monday with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and French President Emmanuel Macron. U.S. national security adviser H.R. McMaster said the conversations would be wide-ranging, but that "Iran\'s destabilizing behavior" would be a major focus of Trump\'s discussions with both leaders.\nBreakthroughs on a Middle East peace agreement are not expected. Jared Kushner, Trump\'s son-in-law and senior adviser on the issue, recently returned from a trip to the Middle East.\nThe United States is the largest contributor to the U.N. budget, reflecting its position as the world\'s largest economy. It pays 25 percent of the U.N.\'s regular operating budget and over 28 percent of the separate peacekeeping budget \xe2\x80\x94 a level of spending that Trump has complained is unfair.\nThe Trump administration is conducting a review of the U.N.\'s 16 far-flung peacekeeping operations, which cost nearly $8 billion a year. Cutting their costs and making them more effective is a top priority for Haley.\n'

aS' On a sweltering Washington summer day, President Donald Trump\'s motorcade pulled up to the Pentagon for a meeting largely billed as a briefing on the Afghanistan conflict and the fight against the Islamic State group.\nThere, in the windowless meeting room known as "The Tank", Trump was to be briefed on the state of America\'s longest-running war as he and his top aides plotted ways ahead. But, according to current and former U.S. officials familiar with the meeting, it was, in reality, about much more.\nTrump\'s national security team had become alarmed by the president\'s frequent questioning about the value of a robust American presence around the world. When briefed on the diplomatic, military and intelligence posts, the new president would often cast doubt on the need for all the resources. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson organized the July 20 session to lay out the case for maintaining far-flung outposts \xe2\x80\x94 and to present it, using charts and maps, in a way the businessman-turned-politician would appreciate.\nThe session was, in effect, American Power 101 and the student was the man working the levers. It was part of the ongoing education of a president who arrived at the White House with no experience in the military or government and brought with him advisers deeply skeptical of what they labeled the "globalist" worldview. In coordinated efforts and quiet conversations, some of Trump\'s aides have worked for months to counter that view, hoping the president can be persuaded to maintain \xe2\x80\x94 if not expand \xe2\x80\x94 the American footprint and influence abroad.\nThe result of the meeting and other similar entreaties may start to become clear this week, as Trump heads to New York for his first address to the United Nations General Assembly. The annual gathering of world leaders will open amid serious concerns about Trump\'s priorities, his support for the body he is addressing and a series of spiraling global crises.\nTrump, who seized as his mantra "America First" and at times unnerved world leaders with his unpredictability, is expected to offer warmth to the United States\' allies and warnings to its adversaries, particularly North Korea and Iran. The president\'s envoy to the global body suggested a presidential message that would focus on the basics on America\'s role in the world.\n"I personally think he slaps the right people, he hugs the right people, and he comes out with the U.S. being very strong in the end," Ambassador Nikki Haley said.\nIn the weeks since the briefing in the Tank, Trump has split with top adviser Steve Bannon, the engine of many of his nationalist, isolationist policies. He threatened war with North Korea and agreed to send more U.S. troops to Afghanistan, abandoning his promise to withdraw quickly. Announcing the plan, Trump acknowledged the influence of his advisers.\n"My original instinct was to pull out \xe2\x80\x94 and, historically, I like following my instincts," he said. "But all my life I\'ve heard that decisions are much different when you sit behind the desk in the Oval Office; in other words, when you\'re President of the United States. So I studied Afghanistan in great detail and from every conceivable angle."\nOn July 20, Trump, Bannon, then-White House chief of staff Reince Priebus, senior adviser Jared Kushner and others stepped from the presidential motorcade and filed down a corridor adorned with formal portraits of former joint chiefs chairmen and into Room 2E924, identified by a small, unobtrusive plaque as "The Tank," to join Vice President Mike Pence, Mattis and Tillerson as well as a host of briefers.\nArmed with charts, maps and diagrams, those briefers spent the next roughly 90 minutes explaining to Trump the critical importance of forward worldwide deployments of U.S. military, intelligence and diplomatic assets, according to two current officials and one former official familiar with the meeting. While the war in Afghanistan and against the Islamic State group in Syria and Iraq were major topics, the stationing of U.S. personnel in Asia, Africa, Europe and Latin America were also covered, said the officials who were not authorized to discuss details of the highly classified briefing and spoke on condition of anonymity.\nThe officials said the purpose was to answer one of Trump\'s most persistent questions of his national security aides: Why does the U.S. government need "so many people" abroad? As such, it was a comprehensive look at military bases, embassies and consulates, CIA stations and other intelligence posts, presented by experts sitting around a large conference table and in chairs lining the walls.\nTo be successful, Mattis and Tillerson decided they should use talking points and commentary with which they believed Trump would be most familiar: the role that the military, intelligence officers and diplomats play in making the world safe for American businesses, like The Trump Organization, to operate and expand abroad. American troops provide stability, diplomats push rule of law and anti-corruption measures and the intelligence community provides context and analysis that drive the first two, the briefers explained, according to the officials.\nThe implications of American retrenchment in an age of increasing international competition were also discussed, the officials said. One chart presented included two maps depicting the exponential growth of China\'s presence in Africa over the past two decades and its impact on U.S. national security and private foreign investment, according to the officials.\nTrump emerged and declared it a "very good meeting."\nAs a student, Trump is known to be alternatively eager and easily distracted.\nCIA chief Mike Pompeo has called Trump both an "avid" and "voracious" consumer of intelligence. Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats, speaking just a day after the Pentagon meeting, told an audience at the Aspen Security Forum that Trump interrupted briefings so often that he and his team frequently needed to circle back to their main points multiple times.\n"What we found is someone who has not been in government, not been in the intelligence business, not having relationship to that, but is asking an awful lot of questions and a lot of them were good questions," he said.\nWhite House aides have readied a crash course for Trump as he prepares for the General Assembly, in part necessitated because the president has delayed some of his preparations, choosing instead to focus on the federal government\'s response to a pair of massive hurricanes and, to a lesser extent in recent days, his dealings with Democrats on immigration issues, according to the officials and advisers.\n'

aS' Hurricane Maria grew into a Category 3 storm on Monday as it barreled toward a potentially devastating collision with islands in the eastern Caribbean. Forecasters warned it was likely to grow even stronger.\nThe storm was on a path that would take it near many of the islands already wrecked by Hurricane Irma and then on toward Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic. Maria could hit Puerto Rico on Wednesday as a Category 3 or 4 hurricane, said Ernesto Morales with the U.S. National Weather Service in San Juan.\n"This storm promises to be catastrophic for our island," he said. "All of Puerto Rico will experience hurricane force winds."\nThe U.S. National Hurricane Center said Maria had maximum sustained winds of 120 mph (195 kph) late Monday morning. It was centered about 95 miles (150 kilometers) east-southeast of Dominica \xe2\x80\x94 or 60 miles (95 kilometers) east of Martinique \xe2\x80\x94 and heading west-northwest at 10 mph (17 kph).\nHurricane warnings were posted for the U.S. and British Virgin Islands, Guadeloupe, Dominica, St. Kitts, Nevis, Montserrat, Martinique and St. Lucia. A tropical storm warning was issued for Antigua and Barbuda, Saba, St. Eustatius, St. Maarten and Anguilla.\nForecasters said hurricane conditions should begin to affect parts of the Leeward Islands by Monday afternoon or evening, with storm surge raising water levels by 4 to 6 feet (1.2 to 1.8 meters) near the storm\'s center. The storm was predicted to bring 6 to 12 inches (15 to 30 centimeters) of rain across the islands, with more in isolated areas.\nOfficials in Dominica closed schools and government offices on Monday and urged people to evacuate and seek shelters.\n"We should not take this storm lightly," said Prime Minister Roosevelt Skerrit. "Let us continue to pray for our safety."\nOfficials in Guadeloupe said the French Caribbean island of would experience extremely heavy flooding starting Monday afternoon, and they warned that many communities would be submerged overnight.\nOn Wednesday, Maria was expected to be near or over Puerto Rico, which was spared the full brunt of Irma, although much of the island had its power knocked out. Nearly 70,000 people remain without power, and Gov. Ricardo Rossello on Monday warned of another widespread outage.\n"We have an extremely weak infrastructure that has already been hit by one storm," he said. "This is going to be a catastrophic event."\nForecasters said the storm would dump up to 18 inches (46 centimeters) of rain across Puerto Rico and whip the U.S. territory with heavy winds for 12 to 24 hours.\nOfficials said the Federal Emergency Management Agency was ready to bring drinking water and help restore power in Puerto Rico immediately after the storm.\nRossello said officials had prepared about 450 shelters with a capacity for nearly 68,000 people \xe2\x80\x94 or even 125,000 in an emergency. Schools were cancelled for Monday and government employees would work only a half day.\nOfficials in the Dominican Republic urged people to leave areas prone to flooding and said fishermen should remain in port.\nFarther north, long-lived Hurricane Jose continued to head northward off the U.S. East Coast, causing dangerous surf and rip currents. It wasn\'t expected to make landfall but tropical storm watches were posted along the coast from Delaware to Massachusetts\' Cape Cod.\nJose was centered about 265 miles (430 kilometers) east-southeast of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina, and was moving north at 9 mph (15 kph). It had maximum sustained winds of 75 mph (120 kph).\nThe ocean washed over parts of North Carolina\'s Outer Banks as Hurricane Jose passed well to the east, and five people were knocked off a coastal jetty in Rhode Island by high surf caused by the storm. Officials said rescuers had to fight through rough surf to load the injured onto stretchers and get them to shore. All five were taken to a hospital with minor and major injuries.\nIn the Pacific, Tropical Storm Norma\'s threat to Mexico\'s Los Cabos resort area at the southern end of the Baja California Peninsula seemed to ease as forecasters said the storm\'s center was likely to remain offshore.\nNorma had winds of about 50 mph (85 kph) and it was centered about 175 miles (280 kilometers) southwest of Cabo San Lucas. The Baja California Sur state government prepared storm shelters and canceled classes for Monday.\nMeanwhile, Tropical Storm Lee weakened into a tropical depression far out in the Atlantic while Hurricane Otis weakened far out in the Pacific. Neither threatened land.\n'

aS' The Senate is on track to pass a defense policy bill that pumps $700 billion into the Pentagon budget, expands U.S. missile defenses in response to North Korea\'s growing hostility and refuses to allow excess military bases to be closed.\nThe legislation is expected to be approved on Monday by a wide margin in another burst of bipartisanship amid President Donald Trump\'s push for cooperation with congressional Democrats. The 1,215-page measure defies a number of White House objections, but Trump hasn\'t threatened to veto the measure. The bill helps him honor a pledge to boost military spending by tens of billions of dollars.\nSen. John McCain, the Armed Services Committee chairman battling an aggressive type of brain cancer, has guided the bill toward passage over the last week as he railed against Washington gridlock and political gamesmanship. But McCain, R-Ariz., couldn\'t quell disputes among his colleagues over several contentious amendments that so far have been blocked from votes and failed to be added to the bill.\nAmong them is a proposal by Sens. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y., and Susan Collins, R-Maine, that would have protected transgender service members from being kicked out of the armed forces. Gillibrand along with McCain seek to achieve the same goal through separate legislation they introduced late last week. The bill also is supported by Jack Reed of Rhode Island, the top Democrat on the Armed Services panel, and Collins.\nAnother amendment, from Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, would have prevented the government from detaining indefinitely U.S. citizens apprehended on American soil who are suspected of supporting a terrorist group.\nApproved by the Armed Services Committee by a vote of 27-0 in late June, the Senate bill would provide $640 billion for core Pentagon operations, such as buying weapons and paying troops, and another $60 billion for wartime missions in Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria and elsewhere. Trump\'s budget request sought $603 billion for basic functions and $65 billion for overseas missions.\nWith North Korea\'s nuclear program a clear threat to the U.S. and its allies, the bill would provide $8.5 billion to strengthen U.S. missile and defense systems. That\'s $630 million more than the Trump administration sought for those programs, according to a committee analysis.\nNorth Korea last week conducted its longest-ever test flight of a ballistic missile, firing an intermediate-range weapon over U.S. ally Japan into the northern Pacific Ocean. The launch signaled both defiance of its rivals and a significant technological advance.\nThe legislation requires the Defense Department to deploy up to 14 additional ground-based interceptors at Fort Greely, Alaska, that will expand to 58 the number of interceptors designed to destroy incoming warheads. The department also is tasked with finding a storage site for as many as 14 spare interceptors, and senators envision an eventual arsenal of 100 with additional missile fields in the Midwest and on the East Coast.\nThe White House, in a statement issued earlier this month, called the order for more interceptors "premature" given the Pentagon\'s ongoing review of missile defense programs.\nAlthough the bill calls for more military spending than at any point during the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, major hurdles need to be cleared before all the extra money materializes. Congress would have to roll back a 2011 law that set strict limits on military spending. That\'s a tall order in the Senate, where support from Democrats will be necessary to get the 60 votes required to lift the so-called budget caps.\nAs their House counterparts did, the Senate bill rejects Defense Secretary Jim Mattis\' plan to launch a new round of base closings starting in 2021. He told lawmakers in June that closing excess installations would save $10 billion over a five-year period. Mattis said the savings could be used to acquire four nuclear submarines or dozens of jet fighters. But military installations are prized possessions in states and lawmakers refused to go along.\n'

aS' A racially mixed crowd of demonstrators locked arms and marched quietly through downtown St. Louis Monday morning to protest the acquittal of a white former police officer in the killing of a black suspect, following another night of unrest and more than 80 arrests.\nThe latest action follows three days of peaceful protests and three nights of violence in the city that has been rocked since Friday, when a judge announced he found Jason Stockley not guilty in the 2011 death of Anthony Lamar Smith.\nHundreds of riot police mobilized downtown late Sunday, arresting more than 80 people and seizing weapons amid reports of property damage and vandalism. The arrests came after demonstrators ignored orders to disperse, police said.\n"I\'m proud to tell you the city of St. Louis is safe and the police owned tonight," Interim Police Chief Lawrence O\'Toole said at a news conference early Monday.\nEarlier Sunday, more than 1,000 people had gathered at police headquarters then marched without trouble through downtown St. Louis, the posh Central West End, and the trendy Delmar Loop area of nearby University City. Protesters also marched through two shopping malls in a wealthy area of St. Louis County.\nBy nightfall, most had gone home. The 100 or so people who remained grew increasingly agitated as they marched back toward downtown. Along the way, they knocked over planters, broke windows at a few shops and hotels, and scattered plastic chairs at an outdoor venue.\nAccording to police, the demonstrators then sprayed bottles with an unknown substance on officers.\nOne officer suffered a leg injury and was taken to a hospital. His condition wasn\'t known.\nSoon afterward, buses brought in additional officers in riot gear, and police scoured downtown deep into the night, making arrests and seizing at least five weapons, according to O\'Toole. Later, officers in riot gear gathered alongside a city boulevard chanting "whose street, our street" \xe2\x80\x94 a common refrain used by the protesters \xe2\x80\x94 after clearing the street of demonstrators and onlookers.\n"We\'re in control. This is our city and we\'re going to protect it," O\'Toole said.\nMayor Lyda Krewson said at the same Monday news conference that "the days have been calm and the nights have been destructive" and that "destruction cannot be tolerated."\nEarly Monday, more than 150 protesters marched arm-in-arm, some carrying signs, to city hall. Police turned traffic away as the marchers blocked a busy St. Louis street during the rush hour crush. Once at city hall, they found their voices, chanting: "I know that we will win." The protesters then marched four blocks to a city court building, where they chanted again, then dispersed. The next protest is scheduled for Monday evening in University City.\nThe recent St. Louis protests follow a pattern seen since the August 2014 killing of Michael Brown in nearby Ferguson: The majority of demonstrators, though angry, are law-abiding. But as the night wears on, a subsection emerges, a different crowd more willing to confront police, sometimes to the point of clashes.\nProtest organizer Anthony Bell said he understands why some act out: While change can come through peaceful protests, such as those led by Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., years of oppression has caused some to turn violent.\n"I do not say the (violent) demonstrators are wrong, but I believe peaceful demonstrations are the best," Bell said.\nMany protesters believe police provoked demonstrators by showing up in riot gear and armored vehicles; police said they had no choice but to protect themselves once protesters started throwing things at them.\nStockley shot Smith after high-speed chase as officers tried to arrest Smith and his partner in a suspected drug deal.\nStockley, 36, testified he felt endangered because he saw Smith holding a silver revolver when Smith backed his car toward the officers and sped away.\nProsecutors said Stockley planted a gun in Smith\'s car after the shooting. The officer\'s DNA was on the weapon but Smith\'s wasn\'t. Dashcam video from Stockley\'s cruiser recorded him saying he was "going to kill this (expletive)." Less than a minute later, he shot Smith five times.\nStockley\'s lawyer dismissed the comment as "human emotions" during a dangerous pursuit. St. Louis Circuit Judge Timothy Wilson, who said prosecutors didn\'t prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Stockley murdered Smith, said the statement could be ambiguous.\nStockley left the police department and moved to Houston three years ago.\n'

aS' The U.S. military flew advanced bombers and stealth jets over the Korean Peninsula and near Japan in drills with South Korean and Japanese warplanes on Monday, three days after North Korea fired a missile over Japan.\nThe United States often sends powerful military aircraft in a show of force in times of heightened animosities with North Korea. The North launched its latest missile as it protested against tough new U.N. sanctions over its sixth nuclear test on Sept. 3.\nMonday\'s flyovers over the Korean Peninsula involved two B-1Bs and four F-35Bs from the U.S. military and four F-15K fighter jets from South Korea, according to the South Korean and U.S. militaries. The U.S. and South Korean planes practiced attacks by releasing live weapons at a firing range in South Korea, the U.S. Pacific Command said in a statement.\nThe U.S. warplanes also conducted formation training with Japanese fighter jets over waters near the southern island of Kyushu, according to the Pacific Command.\nSince Kim Jong Un took power in North Korea in late 2011, his nation has tested weapons at a torrid pace. The country flight-tested two intercontinental ballistic missiles in July. Its nuclear test in September was its most powerful to date.\nMany experts say it\'s only a matter of time until Kim achieves his stated objective of possessing reliable nuclear-tipped missiles capable of striking anywhere in the mainland U.S.\nState media on Saturday quoted Kim as saying that North Korea\'s final goal "is to establish the equilibrium of real force with the U.S. and make the U.S. rulers dare not talk about military option" for the North.\nAlarmed by North Korea\'s advancing weapons programs, many conservatives in South Korea have called for the reintroduction of U.S. tactical nuclear weapons in the South. But the liberal-leaning government of President Moon Jae-in said it has no intention of requesting that the U.S. bring back such weapons.\nSouth Korean Defense Minister Song Young-moo told lawmakers on Monday that it is "not proper" to reintroduce U.S. nuclear weapons. He previously said the idea should be "deeply considered" by the allies, inflaming already-heated debate on the issue.\nMeanwhile, China\'s Communist Party newspaper on Monday criticized the United States for demanding that Beijing put more pressure on North Korea to rein in its weapons programs.\n"The so-called \'China\'s responsibility theory\' is essentially moral kidnapping," the People\'s Daily said in a commentary. It also noted that sanctions should not harm "legitimate economic and trade exchanges between North Korea and the outside world" and the lives of everyday people.\nChina accounts for about 90 percent of North Korea\'s trade and sends largely free crude oil shipments to the North. Beijing has been increasingly frustrated with North Korea\'s nuclear drive, but it still doesn\'t want the North to collapse and cause a wave of refugees to cross the border into China and American troops to move into North Korea.\nChina\'s foreign ministry said Monday that military threats being made by North Korea and the U.S. were counterproductive.\n"Some related parties keep sending threatening messages both in words and deeds that include warnings of military actions to each other," ministry spokesman Lu Kang told reporters at a regular briefing. "But actually, these kinds of actions didn\'t help solving the problem but further complicate the situation, which do no good to the resolution of the peninsular issue."\nInstead, he said, the international community should strictly implement the sanctions imposed on North Korea by the U.N. Security Council.\nGerman Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel also said in comments reported Monday by the Bild daily that the world should wait for the sanctions to bite, but that "visions and courageous steps" such as direct negotiations with North Korea are also needed.\n'

aS' The two suspects detained over last week\'s London subway bombing are an 18-year-old refugee from Iraq and a 21-year old from Syria, both of whom were fostered by a British couple, according to a local official and media reports.\nThe 18-year-old was detained Saturday at the southeast England port of Dover, a departure point for ferries to France. The 21-year-old was held later the same day in Hounslow in west London. Photos published by the Sun newspaper showed a man being detained outside a fast-food restaurant in Hounslow, which was searched by police.\nBoth men are being held under the Terrorism Act and are being questioned at a London police station about Friday\'s attack. Neither has been charged.\nThirty people were injured when an improvised explosive device partly exploded aboard a crowded London Underground train at Parsons Green station during the morning rush hour. None of the injuries was life-threatening, and experts said it appears the main charge of the bomb didn\'t detonate.\nAfter the rush-hour bombing, British officials raised the country\'s terror threat level to the highest level, "critical," meaning an attack may be imminent. They lowered it Sunday to "severe," and police said the investigation was making rapid progress.\nPolice searched three addresses, including the house in suburban Sunbury, outside London, of Penelope and Ronald Jones. The couple has been honored by Queen Elizabeth II for fostering more than 200 children, including refugees from Middle Eastern conflicts.\nIan Harvey, who heads local Spelthorne Borough Council, said he believed the 18-year-old was an Iraqi orphan who moved to the U.K. when he was 15 after his parents died and had lived in the Sunbury house.\nHe said the 21-year-old was also a former foster child of the Joneses. Sky News and other British media named him as Yahyah Farroukh, who is originally from Syria.\nWest Thames College in West London said in a statement that "Yahyah Farroukh, who, according to media reports is the second suspect detained in connection with the Parsons Green incident, was a former student at the college from December 2013 to June 2015." It said he began attending courses when he was 17 to learn English.\nSuleman Sarwar, co-owner of Aladdin\'s Fried Chicken in Hounslow, said Farroukh worked there and was arrested by police Saturday night at the end of his shift.\nStephen Griffiths, who lives across the street from Penelope and Ronald Jones, said police had visited the house several times, most recently two or three weeks ago.\n"The police were there multiple times over the span of about a month \xe2\x80\x94 a few times a week," he said.\n"You always think foster kids are going to have a bit of trouble, but you don\'t think terrorism," he added.\nFootage obtained by broadcaster ITV shows a man near the Sunbury address Friday morning carrying a bag from Lidl supermarket. Images posted on social media following the attack appeared to show wires protruding from a flaming bucket contained in a Lidl bag on the floor of the train carriage.\nCommuters returned to Parsons Green station Monday for the first morning rush hour since the bombing. Police asked the traveling public to be vigilant and said there would be more armed police on the transit network for the time being.\nMost of the injured in Friday\'s explosion aboard a District Line train suffered flash burns while some were injured in the panicked rush to leave.\nThe Islamic State group has claimed responsibility for the attack, but British officials say there is no proof yet that it was involved.\nFour other violent attacks in Britain this year have killed 36 people. Three were the work of attackers motivated by Islamic extremism, and one by anti-Muslim hatred.\nIn the deadliest attack, a suicide bomber struck a packed concert hall in Manchester in northern England, killing 22 people. The other attacks, near Parliament, on London Bridge and near a mosque in Finsbury Park in north London, involved vehicles and, in two cases, knives.\n'
